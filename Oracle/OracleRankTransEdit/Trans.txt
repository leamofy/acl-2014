role of eu for peace in the middle east
from the official point of view the role of the european union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the middle east
according to brussels official stance the efforts of schwarzenberg or sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard
european unions spokesman amadeu altafaj has said that every such effort is admirable which is helpful in sending the european unions message to the opponents of the war
it seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned
but in reality the european union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions
as the head of the union the czech republics role is even weaker than before
and on top of that the internal issues have made it helpless
on the other hand the french president sarkozy is behaving as if he is still the president of the european union
whereas france has completed its presidential tenure of six months
sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it
the most funny situation is faced by the french foreign minister bernard kouchner
he is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of czech republic schwarzenberg
the problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the middle east war
schwarzenberg says that israel has the right of self defense whereas kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense moreover germany has sent its special ambassador to middle east unless the european union does not show unity based on common stance it can not succeed on the diplomatic front
the proof for this is israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the european union
this is a golden chance for the european union to do something since america due to the policies of george w bush has already failed in the middle east
financial crisis german industrialist billionaire commites suicide
adolf merckle a resident of sawabia in southern germany left a huge business group behind him
but a short while ago common german citizens did not know much about it

some time before that the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed but adolf merkel had gone from being a small producer to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion euros so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic power
after the death of his father adolf merkel took over his family business he developed it quick putting it on new lines
he called his company ratiopharm which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in germany
until a while ago the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion euros and it still earns about 81 billion euros a yearafter the superb success of ratiopharmthe merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like hydelburg cement to car manufacturing companies like kassbohrer
the number of employees of the merkel group around the world is near 100000 and its foundation company the pharmaceutical ratiopharm always had special importance
adolf merkel has said many times in his life it has been four generations since i started making medicine
now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and i hope that the management of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years
after the suicide of adolf merkel banks have sanctioned 400 million euros in floating loans for his group but under the condition that vem will have to sell ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term
after the death of adolf marclay the marclay group will not remain the same as it was before

afghanistan voter registration in danger
afghanistans election commission has announced that it is delaying voter registration in some areas of the south due to concerns over security
in southern afghanistan voter registration had to be started this week for the upcoming presidential election
the commission has stated that voters in a few areas of the province hilmand will not be able to get registered unless the security situation improves
in those parts of the south conflict has increased from last year where rebel taliban members have increased attacks on afghan and international forces
meanwhile afghan and international forces have said that overnight from wednesday into thursday they have killed at least 28 militants in battles across afghanistan
nato claimed that its military forces killed 22 enemy soldiers in land and air strikes in the western province of khost near the pakistani border
previously the afghan defense ministry had claimed that the afghan army had killed eight rebels and injured two within the province
it is not clear whether the afghani officeholders are referring to the same incident

according to these officials unmanned planes fired three missiles on a house in mir province of north waziristan killing ten

the present attacks were the first since president barack obama took office
the bush government had been avoiding acknowledging the attacks
on friday suspected american spy planes dropped three missiles in the tribal region of north waziristan five deaths have been reported
the dead could not be identified
according to initial reports the missile attacks were on a house in the locality of mir ali

sarhad state officials reject demand to restrict girls education
in sarhad state officials have rejected the talibans warning to restrict girls education saying that this announcement is against both law and islam
on sunday the education minister of sarhad state sardar husain babar added that the government will never allow such efforts to succeed
he said that the extremists are attempting to deprive our regions children of education
in his words these people try to secretly blow up schools and frighten the boys and girls
talking about the environment of fear and insecurity he said that the local government knows well and wants it to be known that no force can stop the spread of education in the land of the pukhtons
one day ago the taliban soldiers led by moulana fazlullah had demanded that girls be banned from studying in the swats educational institutions beginning on the 15th of january
despite the military activity going on in swat during the last one and a half years about 150 educational institutions were destroyed by the militants by the use of explosives and arson
due to the destruction of these educational institutions thousands of girls and boys were deprived of an education

tea an effective cure for breast cancer
according to a new research three cups of tea a day
if taken can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age by more than a third
in research carried out by the moffitt cancer institute in the american state of florida it was revealed that the risk of occurrence of breast cancer tumors in women below the age of 50 years
it was also revealed in the research that there was no significant benefit in the woman over the age of 50 who drank three or more cups of tea a day
experts believe that the reason for this is that tea has ingredients in it which are more effective against specific tumors which generally occur in women below the age of 50
the moft cancer center in tampa florida studied 5000 women who had taken the treatment for breast cancer
the experts compared their medical records and lifestyle with those of women who have not been diagnosed with breast cancer
the experts also found out that on a particular type of breast cancer called lobular tea had shown to prevent cancer by 66
almost one in ten patients of breast cancer suffer from this type
this type of cancer is more dangerous because it deep inside and is usually diagnosed when it has already spread to a great extent
experts say that by drinking at least three cups of tea a day the danger of breast cancer can be reduced in young women
they say that making tea a regular drink can cause great resistance in the body against breast cancer
in britain every year almost 40000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer
the afghan war is the greatest challenge faced by america gates
american defense minister robert gates has said that the war in afghanistan is the biggest military challenge faced by america
gates will give a briefing today to the senate and house over the strategies of the obama office on the afghanistan and iraq wars
gates told the senate armed services committee that fighting is not the only solution to the afghanistan issue but he added that in order to secure several areas sufficient numbers of troops are not deployed and the taliban take advantage of that to continue their operations
why reduce exercise with age
new research
exercise at any age is good for your health
it energizes your heart reduces cholesterol levels helps in keeping weight low helps to prevent diabetes and slows down the process of alzheimers or dementia
unfortunately the ability to exercise decreases for many people as they age
experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active however age can affect it
according to the american medical association several health related problems can arise from not doing exercise
dr patricia palecca of mayo clinic minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity
dr palecca teaches medicine at the mayo clinic
she lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age
the team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the mechanics of the heart
in which the pumping of the blood by the heart its contraction and relaxation was studied
the experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood
they learned that as people grew old there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart
dr palecca says that as age increases the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear and this affects the ability to exercise
dr garwin cain was also a part of this study
he says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this and this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart
sometimes blood pressure can cause disorders in heart functions and heart disease
if the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard the patient can take advantage of the benefits of exercise regardless of age
a detailed report on this matter is published in a magazine from the american medical association
no chances of an immediate war with pakistan indian army chief
indian army chief general deepak kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with pakistan however we are always ready to defend our country and sacrifice our lives for it he said
he has stated that even with commitments from other nations and international pressure on pakistan as a result of mumbai attacks the infrastructure of terrorism is not only existent but also proactive in pakistan
he said this while talking to correspondents in srinagar
the indian army chief was on a one day tour to the valley of kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in new delhiadministered kashmir and preparation of armed forces on the borders
he was asked his thoughts on media reports that pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from india regarding the mumbai attacks
general kapoor said that the decisions of peace or war matters are made by the political leadership
mentioning the proven presence of a terrorism structure in pakistan he said that the indian army would face such groups which were trying to disturb peace and were bent upon weakening india
he said that in indian kashmir at least 700 to 800 militants were present of which approximately half were foreigners
general deepak kapoor said that with an improvement in the seasonal weather there might be an increase in infiltration from pakistan and pakistan occupied kashmir however india has increased the guard at the borders
he refuted the possibility of decrease in the army posting in kashmir saying that there can be no compromise with regards to national security
may allah bless the tongues of the world and may barack become a blessing for the world
though it was not expected still we shall see how this change will work out in our favor with regards to pakamerican relations
and what does barack obama who is the result of martin luther kings dreams give to the world
obama part of whose name is husain taking the oath today as the american president is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance but also a historic test
not only for himself but also for all the people who supported him
it will even be a test for the white majority as for them to accept from their hearts a black governing over them is no easy task
here in south asia muslims who have expectations from him should remember that he has been elected as the president of the united states and obama should remember that being president of the united states actually means being the president of the entire world
a man whose brothers and sisters were brought to america as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th president of this very america
many people have expectations from this one man
people who love him have unreal expectations from him
if obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world this will be a win for the people who love him
what will be its effect on south asia and can a meaningful change be expected in the american policy regarding this matter
how will this change effect the relationship between america and pakistan
whether it is by obama or some one else the policy of the entire world is done by jews who lobby billionaires and influence powerful and effective people
and as far as pakistan is concerned after the series of recent bombay blasts the offensive reactions of india america and israel are in front of everyone
even for a while after pakistan was formed the managing of swat was left to the ruler of swat who had his own army and law
they surrendered their rule to the government of pakistan according to a treaty
but its sad that our governments have treated swat like a step mother
there has been no increase in the number of schools in swat since the rule of the ruler of swat has come to an end
nor was there any interest in the construction and development over there
the number of girls receiving education in the present rule is a lot less than their number in the previous rule
in the sarhad state of pakistan the local taliban have been targeting the educational institutions
the most schools were destroyed in swat province of which the majority were the girls schools
not only this but the taliban have announced the prohibition of girls education in swat
thousands of boys and girls are being deprived of education
what do you think by stopping girls education thatthe taliban want to achieve
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities so far
what do you think the government should do
the question should be that what isi and pakistani agencies will get as a result
because the people of swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the taliban and not to kill them otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that even during the curfew how can people be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing
when the writ of the government is not being let implemented how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities
now the question arises that having an armed force armed with modern weapons modern technologies and intelligence systems why the government can not control these few taliban
the only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head that neither their arms can reach nor they are apprehended
the result of the discussion is that the taliban with their wrong steps are making it easier for the imperialists
fifteen years before the war was being continued in afghanistan
isi used to control the taliban when there was the opposition from the northern alliance which was supported by russia india and iran
then suddenly the situation changed and the talibans works came to light
and isi also got an offer of money from america so the former friend became an enemy
now the situation has changed but the war is still going on and those supporting them in pakistan are still russia india and iran
until man realizes what is wrong and what is right he continues to make mistakes
for instance when a thief goes to steal something if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong it is a curse and it will bring punishment and he fears allah that person will not steal
similarly as long as israel does not realize that it is doing wrong and spilling the blood of the innocent and it will receive punishment for that it will continue to play god with the blood of the innocent people in gaza
greetings
the question is whether war armed resistance and terrorism are the solutions to the problem
if not then what is the magic recipe that will bring about a solution to the problem
it is true that war and extremism do not solve problems but adds blessings to them
palestine afghanistan and iraq should adopt the same model for their development that nelson mandela used in south africa
that is to struggle character wise and politically more than in an armed manner
after the kashmiris took part in the elections it appears that they have accepted this point of view
we are in the third week of israeli attacks on gaza and the number of deaths have risen to close to a thousand
to date a ceasefire was not possible despite worldwide diplomatic efforts
according to another report since the attacks began on december 27 90000 palestinians have left their homes and moved to a safer location
aid groups have accused israel of being careless about palestinian children saying that a whole generation of palestinian children will be victims of severe psychological and emotional problems

how is permanent peace possible in gaza

the taliban should be given a chance
basit peshawar
please wake up if the taliban starts doing the real jihad then who will kill the innocent people
who will burn down the girls schools
who will kidnap for ransom or if ransom not paid then accuse people of being american agents and hang them on the towers
these taliban have brought such damage to islam that no other nation or religion has ever brought
pashtoon rore
kohat pakistan
if the whole muslim world just gave a joint threat to attack israel you will see how upset will father america will be
and immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well
but what can be done where should our muslim leaders bring the courage from
someone tell ahmed nayad to take the first step as he is very popular for his bravery at the bbc forums
the responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on arab and the muslim worlds but its the obligation of the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny
this unfortunate incident is bushs worst sin so far
just like in pakistan and india before 30th june or the end of the fiscal year the government institutions are looted the american regime just before its end have given a green signal to israel to do what ever it wants
on one hand america says that effort will be made for ceasefire
on the other hand the united nations is passing resolution after resolution but actionwise has done nothing there is only one meaning of this and that is that the even the united nations is openly in favor of destroying the muslims
all muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the united nations and should establish their own global organization
we have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of america and the united nations are seen but the harm is only done to the muslims
what is the use of these vain efforts if bbc does not want to publish anything
where have all the rules of journalism been buried when blood specifically of muslims is spilled the monster of unbiasedness gets onto bbcs back
it considers itself the standard bearer of truth
forget about breaking something on its own the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments from muslims
the only difference between you and the jews is that they call themselves jews and martyr the muslims and the likes of you stay among muslims and call yourselves muslims
syja786
a recent trend in bbc forums has been the subject of terrorism of india and the subject sometimes arises while discussing suicide attacks
these antiislamic comments often use the term extremism
but the real extremist is the person who made the above comment
when will muslims understand that dajjal can not be fought with the sword
looking at the helpless people facing the israel bombings if the heart does not cry what does it do
the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that using the name of jihad disfigures the beautiful face of islam
when a majority of the palestinians have accepted the existence of israel what need does hamas have to send rockets into israel or conduct suicide attacks
the conduct of both sides is misanthropic
the action of the united nations and the united states seem to support the wrongdoings of israel
may allah allow the muslim nation to unite amen
the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism after all they are doing the real work
otherwise is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are
so this situation in common terms is called dadageeri which means do what ever you can
it hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry
medicine for the injured and coffins for the dead are being supplied by the arab leaders and in case
the israeli attacks should take place
this is the actual problem the leaders of muslim countries including the saudi crown prince are in a false sleep they have an neither an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities
they should take immediate measures against israel
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to european countries and america but alas they
salam to all brothers and sisters
i believe that in this time of difficulty telling hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans and it is similar to considering them defeated
if israel and its supporters are at the height of their pharoahism soon moses will be born within their house as this is the rule of nature the steps taken by america and israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the muslims
which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing
abu abdullah pakistan
israel and hamas should enter a truce so that the death and destruction can come to an end
mohammad sarfaraz paris france
absolutely correctly stated
supposing that hamas is 100 on the truth and they are struggling against oppression to become successful in the eyes of allah even then they should know that if a good deed is resulting in the destruction of an established house it is no more a good deed
those who claim to love god love the messenger and love their religion loving mankind is a part of their faith
as if it is the order of allah to evacuate all the people of the book from the face of the earth other than the muslims
najibur rehman psycho lahore pkin
there are no orders to destroy but there are invites for them to come to islam
jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion
these people should be fought against unless they stop these conspiracies this doesnt mean that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering
the only end to the killer of innocent children is destruction
i ask my friends about the israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past they have become so strong today that they dont listen to any one this is because the jews are united
there are no sheas and sunnis there are all just jews and they have developed everything in every field
what is the condition of 55 islamic countries
they are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death
it is essential that all muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against israel
feroz magsi jhang pakistan
and there is no better strategy that recognize israel learn modern education and means of progress and let the world live in peace and harmony
the muslims have plenty of land and means as well
the need is of proper use
this first most disappointing factor is that hamas and alfateh could not unite
great leaders like yasir arafat and sheikh yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing jihad for the aqsa mosque and this was impossible without removing yasin and arafat from the way
the world is witnessing that how palestine had been scattering after the death of these two leaders
and how the jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip
in 1974 a pakistani prime minister was so worldly trusted that first time in the history he manged to gather all the muslim leaders under one roof with hundred percent attendance
today on his 81st birthday is it a very difficult task that the whole nation promise to not only keep unity in its lines
while eradicating the differences between other muslims the formation of an islamic common wealth will be carried forward
it is a monster that has gripped palestine for half a century
this monster has many faces
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world
its other mouths are eating humans in iraq afghanistan iran and pakistan
this monster is most unhappy with islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out it will be through islam muslims and the perfect religion of practical islam have put giants like abu jehl on the right path
bombing from israeli fighter planes on gaza has continued since the 27th of december
more than three hundred palestinians have been killed in these attacks
after the arial attacks israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council the united nations has demanded israel and the palestinian authorities to ceasefire
however the israeli authorities say that they will continue their operation in gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on israel have stopped
in your opinion is isreal being honest in claiming that its doing all this to defend the sovereignty of israel
is the world community playing its role in such situation
does this aggression have an indirect relation to the coming elections in israel
can any improvement be expected in the situation in middle east after the succession of the newly elected american president barak obama

bbc publishes these kind of comments after deep search
a neutral impression is to be maintained
although the news from bbc is usually correct the real thing is the style of the news
it is sometimes difficult to decide what should be highlighted and what news should be given less importance
etc etc
zaheer chughtai
in the pakistani electronic and print media some urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone and cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the grudge of muavia written on them
has said that the united nations which apparently talks of human rights and peace but when it comes to grimness and coercion over muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that hamas should stop the attacks how long this hypocrisy will continue
why is there so much oppresion of the muslim people allah has declared that if countries like america stop supporting the jews then they will live the life of a disgraced people and such people can never lead a proper life so if the americans have courage let them stop their support and then see what kind of life they get
the famous people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice and not by being unjust and killing people
if any tribe could be finished by killing their people and if the required results could be obtained then after hitlers steps not only the presence but the rise that the jews are enjoying today could not have been possible
in the words of a poet
oppression is oppression that the more its done the more it is erased
blood is blood that the more it falls the more it gathers
now who can tell who did terrorism
is all this not included in terrorism why does everybody worry only about their own pain
are others not human or is it that the blood of muslims has become so cheap was the blood of this many innocent not red
and why is there no one to send a mourning message from anywhere
i watched the mumbai incident and felt as if my own house was on fire the sorrow of those affected was overwhelming if only there was a solution to this war
words cannot fully describe the sight of the corpses that littered the street
i feel like crying about the helplessness of muslims because on one side people are dying in india and on the other side the whole world seems to be against pakistan
israel is ruthlessly killing muslims and the whole world is silent this is unbearable
god may delay but he will not abandon all troubles will eventually pass
there is no danger to isreal as long as america is present
there is no doubt that to gain public support elections will have to take place especially in a state like israel as for barack obama history is witness that no american ruler has been able to go against the american people and nor will they go whether the ruler is white or black he is still a ruler
from the discussions going on in the forum it seems that everyone is saddened by her death however her political mistakes have not been forgotten
this issue as to whether benazir gave her life for democracy or for power is debatable
if democracy was important why did she leave musharraf in control of the republic for ten years waiting to make a deal with the americans
benazir did not come to pakistan when the public needed her but she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised

enough of development that we have made
sana khan
few things are ignored just by thinking that nothing can be done of them just like a donkey can not become a scholar by just loading books over it
although after the mumbai attacks there have been setbacks in the dialog between pakistan and india however pakistan and india should continue these dialogs
if we talk of war then it will bring loss of humans from both sides
india says that the man caught in the mumbai attacks is a pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to pakistan in urdu but on the other hand when india initially apprehended this extremist they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader point to be noted
first of all merry christmas to mr bhana and to all the christian brothers of the forum
greeting to all friends of the forum mr psycho a raza sister sana sister shahida and mr akram
we do not want the flames of fire but the flowers of peace
war itself is a problem
will war give a solution to our problems
it will be blessed with fire and blood
it will give hunger and exigence
therefore wise humans
its better to avoid war
in our yard
its better that the glim keeps lightened
the indiaamerica relations have deepened and india knows that when the time comes america will openly betray pakistan
this is also the old history of america
in case of an indian attack america would make its goals and the expense would be on india as well
pakistan should make a clear statement that says we will not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace reconciliation and ceasefire until india is completely destroyed or occupied even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so
this is islamic history
even before this resolution the pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give
indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the mumbai attacks are making it clearer and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has relaxed its pressure now
while ignoring indias unnecessary bobbery the satisfaction of the united nations and the appreciation from the interpol chief over pakistans efforts is a side effect of indias overwhelming diplomacy
there are no two opinions over this it is a heinous act
but the question is this when thousands of taliban attacked the house of pir samiullah where and what was the pakistani army doing at that time
should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past year
how many taliban die each day due to their firing of thousands of mortar and canon shells
and that they stop this fixed operation
the day is not far when a resolution will be passed in the united nations against army intervention in pakistan the same way as it was passed against jamaathuddawah
first of all our radicalism and our protecting them is alone sufficient to provide complete proof and permissibility for action against us and the very day such a resolution is passed there is all probability that no voice will be raised in our support in the united nations
and supposing the passing of such a resolution is delayed some other strength will definitely leave our aid to ourself keeping the example of america in front of them
we do not know about the personality and works of pir samiullah
perhaps he was not a revolutionist
the bodies of comrade che guevara nawab akbar khan bagti dr najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy
they are deathless even after being dead
but here an international game is being played here ferociousness and animosity are created to do the ruling
so there can be reasons created that if we are not here then these vandals and animals can come take over the government
in the name of religion activities of these so called islam lovers is highly condemned
america sees the torture of these extremists but instead of being sad on these faithless activities they easily name them as tribal culture
the reason for these faithless activities sometimes given in the name of tribal culture and other times in the name of islam is not something done by a person with a heart
in my opinion people of our army are with these people
that is because when they change destination it takes time but to catch them forget about getting there on time even if they are on the spot they leave from there
are they so brave that they keep 5070 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators
they are also men of god and so is our army
it is very clear that there is something fishy
instead of promoting gods blessing and merciful nature discussing various disastrous and punitive occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was seen and besides the event of hanging the dead body their literature and books like what will happen after death also create fear and terror
and these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power
wiso
like you have scared the world from the fire of hell
it comes as a surprise when it is said that this was not done by a muslim
we are either unaware of our history or we choose not to know about it
was the attack of yazids forces on medina not the act of christians and the jews
without accepting reality neither the motives can be diminished nor correction can be made
o bbc please stop this dualheaded policy
better than this topic the super hit title shoeing of bush fair or unfair
should have been
tahir choudhry japan
please show some modesty a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression and you are concerned about the topic of the box office
the success of operation sherdil and across the border operation lion heart depends on the fact that in whose favor is the opinion of general public
this act is of american and pakistani agencies and peer sahab is a victim of this conspiracy
all discussions on this forum will now be anti taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined taliban and they are doing what can change the public opinion
i only want to ask when this body was hanging for a whole day what was the army doing are they only there for targeting the public they even report something like this bombing of taliban residences a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother
did they not know about this mistake
or were they watching the show
we fold our hands and request them to please for gods sake stop this game
after all there is a ruler above you
whether the question asked by bbc is understandable or not it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer for instance no one asked what the army of 30000 in swat went there to do
the bodies of the taliban who help the army are left hanging on poles throughout the day
whatever the green footed pakistani government did with the swat public the media including bbc did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality
the pakistani army is putting up a drama
every child in swat is saying that this is a bloody drama
for gods sake stop this drama
these taliban members have tarnished the muslim image
if around the world true muslims dont call these terrorists muslims then why are these elements able to live in the lands of true muslims
those who become shameless cant do hard labor and they pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups
feel the shame
its need is neither in any religion nor in any customs
all media including bbc gives thier views about taliban and tribal areas by different resources
but nobody knows what the actual situation is it is we who know about it because we are tribals
in short this is a game in which cia raw musad and our own isi is involvedthere is nothing like taliban or tribal people they are the negative elements created by these institutions who are spoiling the name of islam taliban religous institutes pukhtoon nation and tribals
this move has ashamed all muslims
i salute mqms altaf hussain and the leadership of anp and ppp who speak against this cancer that is the taliban
this cancer is a product of ziaulhaq a man who died but also destroyed pakistan
but i am hopeful that the current leadership will end this cancer
after the mumbai attacks india said that extremists are behind the attacks
pakistan rejected the accusations and said that it will help india in investigating the attacks in every possible way
india said that it has given a list to pakistan that has 20 suspected extremists being sought by india
now pakistan has said that included in the list is jaishemuhammads molana azhar masood who is not in custody and the government of pakistan has no information about him
before that pakistan president asif ali zardari refuted the view that the wests secret agencies and the indian government had given evidence related to the mumbai attacks
president zardari has said that it has not been proven that ajmal kasab is a pakistani
meanwhile prime minister manmohan singh has warned pakistan that its relation with india can not improve unless its land is being used for terrorism
and in a latest development the indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to pakistan
should these political instances affect over the sports
what do you see as the future of pakistan and india relations
neither america will break pakistan nor india
pakistan will be broken by pakistanis themselves
what do you expect after so much provincialism sectarianism and mullaism
although jinnah also did not do good to the muslims of india and it has been proven with time
yasmin chicago
madam if mr jinnahs vision was followed neither the cancer of provincialism sectarianism and mullaism had spread in pakistan nor the muslims in india had undergone such behavior
its our fault that we could not bring up a leader of his stature
if we can not care for our heroes then
this region has great capabilities
god knows when well understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity
in both countries enemies of peace like mullas pandits taliban shiv sena rss have been raised
the evil powers dont want this region to progress therefore these countries are controlled like puppets
can you imagine what status this region of pakistan india and china will have in the world
pakistan is under persecution from god that these thieves bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation
may allah protect our country from any harm amen
but sir open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and reality on the ground and you will figure out how far american forces have penetrated
moreover the internal affairs dont seem to be good as you can see the circumstances in nwfp balochistan and in karachi in sindh
in this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation
o allah bestow your mercy upon us
according to my understanding a final war is inevitable
this is enough of it
now it should be do or die
this problem cannot be solved through these acts of insincere dialogues
and not through small scale terrorism in each others country
after all europe got settled after the final world war
and if this world war had not taken place then these countries just like pakistan and india would have been clattering
almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be finished
but our military leadership does not seem to be sincere in these regard on the one hand america and europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism and on the other hand we secretly help the taiban
we should think and fix our direction and choose only one way thanks
there is no doubt that majority of the workers of jamaathud dawah are the previous members of lashkaretaiba who joined the group called jamaathud dawah pakistan after lashkaretaiba was rendered inexistent
however after that the members gave preference to social work and now even jamaathud dawah was rendered inexistent by the united nations due to the pressure applied by india and the crackdown being enforced by the pakistani government
i believe that if jihadi groups leave religious fundamentalism and take up social efforts that would be better
the present terrorist groups those bring in criminals in the name of jihad and the elders of these mullas are the same people who used to call pakistan as palidistan and who knows what else
now they are not leaving any stone unturned in destroying pakistan
actually these are not even fit to be called human beings let alone muslims
without cleaning pakistan of these mischief mongers the national security will remain at risk
can we still think about whether or not to put a ban on these mischief mongers
there is no place on earth for extremist mullahs who only work to cause killings
hearts are breaking into pieces over this news
what kind of world is this where one cannot survive as an important part of allahs religion islam
non muslims can kill muslims but if a muslim even tries to take revenge along with the whole non muslim world our hypocrite leaders treat those with true and sincere religion just like they are treating our great leader hafiz saeed now a days
as a penalty of mumbai attacks india
pakistani relations are affected and the recent improvement in relations between the two countries are stopped
india continually blames active armed and unarmed groups in pakistan
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the actions against these groups
whereas indian security agencies have directly blamed lashkr e taiba for mumbai attacks
the name jamaathud dawah also comes up many times in this regards
this is not the first time that relationships between the two countries have become serious due to some terrorist activity that took place in india
in december 2001 after the attack on the parliament the two neighbors were prepared to go to war
after that lashkaretaiba was banned and it was included in the list of terrorist groups
now it is being demanded that jamaathud dawah which according to security reports is just a new form of lashkaretaiba also be banned
in your opinion should this group be banned
should pakistan take decisive action against the active fundamentalist groups within its boundaries
can putting a ban on jamaathud dawah help the present indo
pak crisis to subside and how important is it for permanent peace between the two countries that armed groups be dismantled
the security council of the united nations has passed the ban on jamaathud dawah however what proof did the security council have based on which it showed such urgency
does the security council always show this type of urgency dealing with the muslims
this is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness
if you think about it even india has become an unsuccessful state
whose intelligence army and security institutes failed and were brought to their knees by a few terrorists for three days and india wants to put the blame for its inability on pakistan to fool the whole world
when one disbeliever dies there is an uproar the whole world over why these double standards
to a non political religious and social organisation of our dear country
furqan farooq faisalabad
as long as our prophet (pbuh) the awliya kiram and the sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect the religion of islam would spread and prosper with peace
muslims have also advanced in every field
but when mullahism rose in popularity in the religion the people were divided into muslims and kafirs and new avenues of mischief were opened which were not known to the world previously
salam please do it with pleasure but act at your own discretion
do not do it under american pressure
if india is aggrieved it should provide the evidence
why doesnt it give it
why does it accuse us of every thing
as there are extremist groups and organizations in india why dont they put sanctions on them
are we the only terrorists in the world
what is india doing in kashmir
what is israel doing
the truth is that we are the first nuclear muslim state and this is the main issue
pakistan is now in its last stages
kamran hassan abu dhabi
your words touch the heart and the situation seems so
now in american publications the new map of pakistan is being printed and all these restrictions are now apparent in the series of events
the americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over pakistan
in this situation if we do not stand together and show our unity then remember if bangladesh can be made then anything can happen
the more terrorism is condemned the lesser it is whether it is in a hotel at mumbai in marriott hotel islamabad or in palestine
likewise irrespective of the origin of the terrorist they should be eliminated no matter these are pakistanis or indian or american or israelite
now the question remains why the whole world including the pakistani officials is silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in pakistan resulting in the death of hundreds of people
was the attack carried out on marriott hotel not committed by terrorists
then why
hale to the advisor for interior rehman malik how brave and bold has the gentleman become
not only this but according to bbc mr malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under someoness pressure
wow all praise to the almighty
whether having the ability or not or to say what i do not want
we the pakistanis are fighting whos war
we have our own interests that we shall do our best to protect
no one has a right to interfere with anyones national affairs
the colonial system is apparently not there
if people expect justice demand that an external united court be established respect democratic institutions and not help any dictator or army man there will be peace in the third world including pakistan i do not believe this is acceptable by those calling for unity
as such pakistan is always following the goals set by europe and america
this happens despite the opposition of a majority of the pakistani population
and this causes more feelings of opposition
if they trust america and the united republics then let them leave the style of new populations and let them work on those lines upholding the sovereignty of the state
pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm
in pakistanoccupied kashmir security forces captured a proved camp of practically nonexistent lashkaretaiba
since the mumbai attacks pressure is increasing on pakistan to act against the extremist organizations
indias accusation is that lashkaretaiba is involved in the mumbai attacks
it is their claim that without a doubt the extremists who carried out the mumbai attacks used pakistani land
in the meanwhile officials in peshawar claim that the lot of trucks which carry supplies to the united forces in afghanistan was burnt by unidentified armed people because of which more than 50 trucks were destroyed
this is the second attack in peshawar on nato and american supplies in the last 48 hours
in the meanwhile pakistan captured an established camp of the almost inexistent lashkaretaiba previously lots of efforts were carried out to try to disarm armed groups all the way from karachi to the tribal regions which included giving compensation to those who returned their weapons and even assuring them that no action would be taken against them
the question is what does pakistan want to do
does pakistan have the ability to do so
what do you say

i have only one question for all humanitarian leaders
it is impossible that you murder their children and they bring garlands to you
is there any logic reason or philosophy which allows killing of innocent people including namazi laborers and poor service men as revenge to american attacks
if your answer is no you need to correct your point of view
after afghanistan people were armed because there was a danger of russia coming towards pakistan
now that the danger is of america attacking pakistan from the afghanistan channel as mentioned directly in the presidential campaign by the president himself why should these people be unarmed
it is because america and india will not have to face any public resistance after defeating the pakistan army
if any of them are involved in terrorist activities only pakistan should take action against them
it is sad that the fact that lashkaretaiba is involved proves indias claim that pakistan is guilty in this
najeebur rahman syco lahore
even if we accept that lashkaretaiba is guilty its still not correct to blame the pakistani government
another question is that were these terrorists supported by an indian governmental or nongovernmental agent
are terrorists only born or trained in pakistan and not any other country in the world
as for lashkaretaiba the present terrorism is in no way connected to it
it must be remembered that hafiz saeed is the first jehadi leader who called the taliban actions mischief
im sure that the taliban effect is a inseparable result of american plans and hence every person who can stand in the way of the taliban must be removed
to stop the project that is running on saudiamerican funding they must be requested themselves to regather the filth that has polluted our society
and also protest against them asking them based on what ethics america and saudi spread dangerous weapons and so called jihadi but in reality hate inciting and cultural virus enticing literature in our country because of which our country has become a human slaughterhouse
after facing the risk of attack from india the pakistani armys announcement that it would remove forces from the afghan border and post them at the indian border and the announcement of the taliban that it would handle the afghan border caused america to stumble and pressurize india not to attack pakistan
this showed the strength of america in the region
however india did not warn that they would attack nor do they have that much courage
the taliban attacked and depleted most of the remaining american supplies
that proves that without the pakistani army and the pakistani government america is nothing
karachi is the trade and financial center of pakistan and the dubai of the backward regions
hundreds of thousands never return from here empty handed but ever since the law and order situation in the western border regions was lost all people diverted their attention here
now they want to kidnap this city
for the first time pathans began to be called pukhtons and the people of a single town are made foreigners and are being made to fight while the need is for unity
one solution to the problem is that the urdu speaking learn pushto or the pushto speaking learn urdu its better that everybody learns english
you must be thinking its a funny suggestion but dont you think the cause of the conflict is also amusing
that the cause of the torture would be language
zaheer chughtai
sir in my childhood i had actually gave the same suggestion many times to my friends which included people from every religion and rhetoric groups but these people used to laugh over these suggestions
at that time these rhetoric and religious differences were not as apparently alive and powerful on the surface but they were boiling inside
its hard to understand what is happening and why
are these the signs of the judgement day
what are these innocent and obnoxious people being killed for
the reason is in front of everyone the ones who want to break pakistan into pieces are active and those who do all this neither belong to any one religion nor a country
be it karachi or mumbai the houses were set on fire by its own residents
which ever government comes to power changes the name of important infrastructure projects like airports major roads and building presently this is the case and buildings airports etc have been renamed as baynazeer
does baynzeer understand what is going on with the people of karachi and pakistan
while the mumbai attack was on peak the initiative taken by raw(indian spy agency)to start sectarian violence was busted this event proves that in past political figures on raws payroll have now given up the job
spilling of innocent blood of pushto speaking people and with india threatening many times have awakened the pakistanis from karachi to khyber
all strict applause of anger from political religious sectarian and national bodies is now teaching india the manners of diplomatic speech they have provided american strategists a chance to think again
those responsible for the turmoil in karachi are mutahida and awami national party anp where as the establishment is inclined towards one party and not neutral
the establishment could have controlled the events in an hour but intentionally allowed to the event to escalate
police and rangers abstained from taking any action since they were under pressure from political parties
the talks about a unity amongst political parties on the issue is limited to paper only the party will have to forgo their own vested interests and work for the interests of a common man
until there is pressure on the administration these kind of incidents will keep taking place
i think these people are the biggest terrorists
and foreign powers are definitely involved in this but no one knows who they are
but alas that if these incidents were in any city of nwfp then what would the government have done over there but since its not in nwfp the government seems to be helpless
the government should operate here and save a large and very important city of the country from terrorism
otherwise pakistan will face a huge financial crisis
bbc urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure and pakistani medias condition is already weak
the whole truth is there on bbc english
one solution to the problem is that either urdu speakers should learn pushto or pushto speaking learn urdu or better if every body learns english
you will definitely take is as a funny suggestion but dont you think the cause of the conflict is also funny
that the cause of extremism could be language
they spilled blood in karachi and the story that each citizen was fearing for a long time was finally written
no one left any stone unturned and the reports that surfaced in the media was 50 of what actually happened here in four days
i stayed up the last three nights and i am still afraid
the people who killed the cobblers and peanut sellers who evacuated the hotel (this is a fragment)
the people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of allahs punishment which can catch them anytime
what do you think are the reasons for this sudden violence
(bbc)
keeping the heart rendering mumbai attacks in view and driving to search for a cause for the violence in karachi is not at all needed rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in blood
it is obvious that if someone mistreats the father it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control
the blood of the loyalists of liaqat ali khan also belonged to the same place but to eliminate mr psychos misunderstanding i am writing this verse
we will also repeat our elders traditions
we made it by sacrificing lives and will save it by doing the same
faizan tauseef siddiqui
it is very disappointing that whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other
mr siddiqui i request if wikipedia
see liaqat ali khan you will will find out that he belonged to a noble punjabi family from karnal in punjab
due to his steps for the migrants today the migrants consider him as one of them
there is always a reaction to every action
one can afford on oneself but
ijaz awan
sir before you get a large number of people with proposals i shall tell you that the open signs of this mischief is also found on the walls of karachi in the form of posters and wall chalking
we have been bearing both types of mischief
mischief mongers did not leave pakistan or the founder of pakistan they did not have to face any reaction
contrary to that they are pecking at the chest of pakistan
there used to be one muslim league they made the rough version of the 18th amendment and handed it over to the peoples party
before that mqm and muslim league had already handed in rough versions of the 18th amendment to the national assembly and senate
it still seems that the copy of the 18th amendment is a political trickery and no one is sincere about accepting that amendment
this is why no fuss was made in the assembly or on the floor of senate over this amendment and the parliament was not forced into accepting the amendment
it looks as if the parties just wanted to get the thing off their backs by submitting the rough versions so that tomorrow they may say that we submitted our versions of the amendment but the government speaker did not take action
mqm coalition partner of government muslim league n an underhand ally of government and muslim league q the party to approve the seventeenth amendment then how is it possible that these parties can be sincere to approve the disapprove amendment
its just like writing your name amongst shaheeds by just putting color on yourself
the peoples party at any rate is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment
how would one think of getting his own hands cut
as long as zardari is the president the seventeenth amendment is not going to be repealed
this is the opinion of a majority in our survey and so is the truth
if the seventeenth amendment was to be repealed then zardari would never have become the president
now he is even more powerful than president musharaf as along with being the president he is also the chairman of the peoples party
as long as he is the president the seventeenth amendment will remain intact
in order to cancel the seventeenth amendment the political parties will first have to dismiss president zardari from the presidency
neither mqm nor other parties want this
most of the elders from our family belonged to the labor community
in our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor work we used to pray to allah to save us from this hard work
to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily amroz and asked him what we should we do after matriculation so that we dont have to do labor work
the editor wrote in reply that we should select certain subjects and become doctors or engineers
right from beginning my trend was towards engineering i had selected technical drawing instead of biology as well
but at the time of admission in fsc my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing fsc in medical
i studied biology for a month and then took math as an alternate subject when nothing worked out
the fear of labor work made me an engineer and now i am in a better position than other in my family for which i am always thankful to god
i remembered that when my two sons and i were trying to remove the carpets from our old house
we said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor
son started saying that i am studying and will complete my studies but i cant do this work
three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home
what it means is that when a man decides the destination no matter what were the motives behind this no one can stop him from getting it
but if you dont even know what you have to do then god be with you
they say that you should not speak bad about the dead but what can i do even after one year of benazirs death i can only see faults in her
for personal interests benazir handed over the list of sikhs who were fighting for independence to india at the same time they were crushing the sikhs independence movement and also allowing india to transfer its complete attention to pakistan having taken care of the punjab movement
the russia wars in the regimes of benazir and nawaz sherif have become a part of history which pushed the country many years back
benazir continued to speak ill about kashmir and the atomic program throughout his exile
benazir violated the london agreement with nawaz sharif and made a deal with general musharaf
during her rule benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make money that is why he is known as mr ten percent
during benazirs rule his brother got killed but his murderers are still safe from any punishment
although she was a woman herself benazir avoided fighting for womens rights
just as benazir conducted her politics over her fathers dead body similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body
benazir came into power twice but she could not punish the culprits of her fathers political murder even she couldnt register a case against them
it has been 37 years since east pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day
what should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated december 16 as a didactic day and take measures to ensure that this kind of incident doesnt happen again
on this day we can send greetings to the people of bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again
the rulers would reopen the hamudur rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of east pakistan
they used to make arrangements to bring back the biharis trapped in bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits
but we lack feelings now we are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood
we do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish
even if a great accident occurs we are busy in our daily routines of life from one day to the next
if only east and west pakistan could be one together just as east and west germany were united once again
we can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness
but this wish does not seem likely to be granted in the near future
it was announced in the news today that the governor of the american state illinois had been arrested on corruption charges
when the state congress started getting ready to remove him from the position of governor as soon as possible there was one american companion of ours who keeps a close watch on the circumstances of pakistan who boastfully claimed to us that this is what we call democracy
in america even the higher level people are not above the law
and there is your country pakistan whose president has been elected after his corruption charges were dropped
my sense of humor spoke and i said whats wrong if a governor got arrested in america in pakistan we arrested the prime minister overnight and hanged him once and another time we exiled one
tell me when it happened in america
pakistan sent off the criminal with a guard of honor from the presidency tell me when did such a thing happen in america
in pakistan the chief justice was suspended in such a way that besides the public support he is unable to be restored so far did this ever happen in america
a holder of a falsified degree was made the minster of health in pakistan did this ever happen in america
after hearing all this the american went down laughing and then conceded defeat
in this picture president zardari is smiling despite being surrounded by americans on all four sides
it looks from his smile
he thinks that america is supporting his government but he forgot that a year ago they supported pervez musharaf
this picture was passed on as if it was of some family
previously such a photo was never printed in newspapers before ie one president with three american agents
it seems as if americas work in pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one
it is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of president zardari breaking his promises
if it was a smart ruler at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting
if the rules of democracy are implemented on this photo president zardari is in minority
according to democracy the majority are the rulers of the country and the photo is speaking for itself who that is
paradiselike swat is also called the switzerland of pakistan
according to the government tactic so far along with force discussions have been going on
but the use of force is not giving any benefit other than increasing the force of the taliban and increasing the public favor for them
the government must instead of using the power eliminate the causes of the issue
by eliminating the causes fazlullah and taliban will automatically disperse
the sharia bill proposed by anp will to a great extent become the solution of the problems of swat
but besides implementation of the sharia the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues
at the beginning of general musharaf rise it looked like the nation had rid itself of the incompetent politicians but the lust for power changed all his plans
those steps which were expected all brokeoff
as soon as bushs era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment made a deal with the thieves
even then general musharaf could control the army but never know what wass happening to the present government
in swat the strongly affected part of sarhad state despite the continuity of military action for over one year the situation is still going from bad to worse
on one side the government is only reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly on the other side the talibans illegal radio fm channel is having much more influence in the region
on the third side the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region
during the action of the security forces there were claims of destroying the fundamentalists by the bombing of gun ship helicopters and cannon houses but despite these destructions the taliban only became more powerful and according to an estimation their control over swat increased that much more
as a result on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat and on the other hand the taliban is getting stronger
who are stuck in between the poor civilians
it is said in swat that someone asked what kind of people the taliban were so he got the answer they are very good as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of allah and the religion
then he asked how the army was so he got the answer they are very good as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country
he then asked who the enemies of the religion and the country were so he got the answer we civilians
i am wondering how the pakistani army will fight the indian army when they couldnt control a small faction of the taliban
they could not track down talibans illegally operated fm channel which in my opinion is very easy
but still fm was spreading hatred in full swing
girls schools as well as boys schools are now being destroyed
a curfew is imposed so that talibans can move around easily
tonight 8 trucks entered the suburbs of mingora during curfew and created bunkers
the question is how could they reach it during curfew
the army could kill akbar bugti in his house and salutes the taliban
for gods sake someone tell this army to protect the helpless people of sawat from the taliban and prove that the pakistan army can overcome any enemy
he says maximum bloodshed has been done in the name of religion you tell me in the absence of any religion wont bloodshed still occur
punjabi and pathan white and black mehsud and other tribes are all these created by religion
no sir no way only religion teaches that there is no black and white there is no punjabi and no immigrant if it were not for religion then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between the white and the black and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribebrotherhood hatred
actually only religion trains mans character and restricts him as he has not come here on his own will but rather the creator of all that exists sent him here and he must live here according to his commands
as a muslim i am completely convinced that islam is a complete way of life and the true religion
after settling down in london every morning i would first call my relatives and ask them how they were most of them had never called me to find out how i was doing and i then realized that they do not like me calling them either so i stopped calling them
living here in france for two years i also felt the same way
i do not know why people only expect us to call
a resolution about iraq passed in a few hours to send a peace force to darfur is not at all a problem
immediately criticizing the mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours
and where there is a matter of death we are still holding meetings about that
o upholders of world peace life is finishing over here
is it really being waited to diminish
so that no could again even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights (this is a fragment we dont have a topicwhy or who what was the action)
when a father is running carrying his beloved sons dead body even then your hearts dont pinch you with pain
if not then you dont even deserve to be called human being
you become a black mottle over the name of humanity
so at least it has been proven that this region has also been a homeland for jews for centuries
ideally these two nations should have lived in harmony but their strings are in western and arab hands so without their own will peace can not prevail in this region
and even now iran wants to fight its proxy war from here
even if the israeli operation stops temporarily tension is so high it will start again any moment after any incident
bbcs own country has its interests related to america and israel and this is why while taking cover of enlightened moderation it has started a series of blogs on jewism and this creates biased propaganda
bbc is only completing a formality and its goal and intent is to gather well wishes
i request the moderator to publish this comment of fidwi so it be known that at least a little bit of affinity towards truth is still remaining in bbc
thank you
i dont know who wrote this story or how this story came to being but one thing is for sure in every age draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people
in every age wars have been fought and blood has been spilled
but the surprising thing is that this 21st century man who considers himself civilized is quiet over this ruthless open massacre
how could i not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind

at this time including derah gahzi khan summer showers are taking place throughout the country
enjoy the weather along with this poem related to it
the rains are present
if it rains it is spring
if it stays then it is peace
sometimes it comes without a reason
at times it spreads over day and night
sometimes it is very noisy and sometimes it is very quiet
the rains are present
in a memory at a night
to a buried ash
sometimes the wind put it out
sometimes it burned itself
sometimes each drop seems sorrowful
even these rains are from you
all these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase what it means to them is whether the country lasts or not
whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them
our media is corrupted like our leaders
its goal is only to extract money from the government and nothing else
as for the public they are ignorant to speak about them is the biggest ignorance
yesterday afternoon something surprising happened
police are running here and there but dont ask about illegal parking
whats more nypd traffic was not able to look at illegally parked vehicles
something like this happened when a plane of us air really became a ship and landed in the hudson river
until now we only thought that terrorists are of the descendants of geese
yesterday was perhaps historically cold in new york
the temperature does not fall this much
even my jaw started hurting from my half an hour walk outside
imagine how the people who jumped from the plane into the river would have felt
it is a matter of luck that all people were safe
and it was sad that the companys plane sunk during this financial crisis
i went by the west side highway to new jersey watching all this and i saw that southbound was blocked but what did i still do
yes i got stuck in the same rush on the way back
thankfully during my onehour trip the way had opened at least a bit so i was able to use the 56th street exit
when i saw the lines waiting at them i had not taken the previous two exits
makki my pakistan well congratulations eid mubarak to you too

we unnecessarily kept thinking of these taliban of swat as indelicate and were only unhappy over female education
they kept expressing their grief by demolishing an allwomen school and college somewhere every day
just like other ideas this idea did not also come true according to this report by cnn today on the sacred day of monday this taliban gang of swat have blasted an allboys school
swat the taliban has destroyed a boys school
the girls schools were already destroyed according to the famous english saying ladies first i do not know why people are still bent on calling the taliban uncultured and barbaric
another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusations against the taliban that they are against girls education is not true
rather says masha allah they are against education altogether
may allah give these mujaheddin more power and the evil government
which is let loose on us may he help them in uprooting them
just before this the wedding between a dog and a girl took place
look at that groom
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century
it is the era of computers and its involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life
many people have reservations over this increasing involvement of the computer in financial matters
where use of credit cards bring ease to life it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life
so that now you can be located by transactions from your credit card
and in future when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent its benefits will increase more and more
similarly in the world of crimes instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank it is easier to steal credit card information
similarly computers have become the source of friendship
social networking websites like orcet facebook and myspace are ranked first in popularity
but dont you feel that the more closer we are getting of these sites mentally practically moving further away from people
similarly there is the website of match making where by knowing your choice you are provided with a list of people according to your likings
can you spend life with your own cologne (of course not physical)
i cant do it that is why a life partner is known as better half
that heshe may cover my deficiencies
perhaps i have got a small share of sense
i used to believe everything someone elder says
in the same way i thought that my father knew the answer to every question on earth
i used to get laughed at a lot for this
but only that saying seemed true which could be possible
become much irritation because what was the reason to tell lie
bore loss on that saying even at this age
so it is my effort to say lie the very least
do not misguide someone by lying and attaching allahs name to said lie
and allah willing say only when there is pray to allah that work completes
remaining allah knows better the state of intention
this is a disgusting problem that results from a distancing from religion
according to the law of both pakistan and our religion minor children should remain with their mothers
their expense is due to their father and father can meet with children
then when they mature they live with whom they want to live
you are right that the actual problem is the relatives who misguide
feudalism has overshadowed our deeds
even here thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in fathers property so it is resisted although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated
here these restriction regarding relations have created many evils in the society
the concept of remarriage of a divorcee or a widow is getting rare
due to these unnecessary beliefs and tradition the family system is facing disarray
in our society if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarry then why it is not appreciated
there is a pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago now after getting all his children married when he married a widow his own children have gone against him
in my opinion this is religious right what do you say
what type of mentality is the while we are there no one can take our mothers place kind of mentality
i believe that this persons children should have thought whats wrong if he married a widow after he married off all his children
this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house
as the children would get busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him
the reason for this is ignorance
this is a result of the force of society
when people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that children start to feel ashamed of their fathers second marriage
though they should face the environment and say that their fathers action is in perfect accordance with islam
this is the curse of our society we are facing for the last 4050 years
a wife can accept that her husband has illicit relations but she cannot stand him having a second wife
if possible stop him from doing so even after you die
she destroys her husband and her own hereafter and becomes a cause for spreading filth in society
when chanting islam it does not mean anything in reality we only like our culture and traditions
for instance we try to keep girls from gaining education and are fearful of allowing a girl to marry someone of her choice
as for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house it was so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt)
in the indo pak subcontinent islam was accepted centuries ago but it could not leave its ignorant mentality and has always kept culture and tradition above islam
think of a mans second marriage as an innovation divorce as a clinical rest and divorced woman as untouchable you must love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife it is all a part of this mentality
whats more in mimicry of the western countries we have started to consider piety and veil as old fashioned
accepting islam is easy but leaving this mentality is very difficult
allah bless us all the courage for it
amen
writing urdu was never that difficult
centuries passed in writing this little
consider it enough
allah hafiz
but here the situation is otherwise
to say that common people are there to die for us if we die then we are a martyr
but if someone from the common people dies then it is murder
may peace and blessing of almighty be upon you
i was coming back to my shop after the isha prayer tonight a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called me
i thought that probably this man has lost his way or wants to ask something i stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car
he asked me if i could speak and understand arabic i said no problem you tell me whats up
he started telling that he has come from riyadh and here in medina someone picked his pocket so he needed help i said please go away brother since such an incident has already taken place with me that i gave this man 12 riyals so that he could reach riyadh but he started doing the same act after moving a little further
i was furious i cursed him and threatened him to the police then he ran away
this is the situation of muslims now that even for begging we ride our cars along with our families and make at least 2 to 3 thousand a day
however there is a clear hadith (saaw) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one
may allah bless us and make us true muslims (amen)

the police station advised her to contact a court
adnan samis wife saba giladari gave a complaint against her husband saying that he continuously tortures her
and that he treats her in a nonhuman manner
now it has become difficult for her to bear and that is why she has filed a case against him
the police instead of filing a case told her to contact a court saying that this matter was not one which the police could touch
in your opinion is the accusation against adnan sami by his wife proper

nothing comes before prestige
however the relations between adnan sami and his present wife may be he left his respectful life and went to india to make money and now this fame has caught him badly

top american officials say that president obama will take a strict stance over afghan president hamid karzai
in the new american policy over afghanistan there is more emphasis on war than development

malik babar hussain judah it is very disappointing that even today these kinds of heathenish traditions continue to occur these feudal lords target innocent people using their authority who would call them muslims

the shrilanken cricket team has arrived karachi to play one day internationals

upon reaching the karachi airport the srilankan team was very warmly welcomed

all the people of kashmiris have been fighting a war of independence for the past sixty years
no no one asked now they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism they have started talking about peace and settlement

in any way pakistan has to understand their deceptive policies
asad khan london
india is creating this situation hoping to distract world attention from the kashmir issue
but pakistan has always showed the true face of india to the world
now the british government has realized that the indian government is maligning pakistan for terrorism so that it can occupy kashmir
they are unwilling to talk with pakistan on this matter
british foreign minister david miliband said that resolving the kashmir issue will end extremism the pakistan government will be able to handle the border issues
it should be noted that american president obama has already expressed similar views on the kashmir issue
the british foreign minister talked to media in mumbai and has written an essay asserting that the idea of war on terror is wrong namely bushs policy of killing others on the basis of the threat to oneself
david miliband has said that pakistan should show leniency towards extremist groups
under pressure from major world powers to resolve the kashmir issue india is creating unrest in the region to distract world from this issue
the terrorist attack in mumbai is also a part of this strategy
is india using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialogue

i think super powers dont want to destroy pakistan
rather they are thinking of certain policies to control her they are familiar that pakistan is an atomic power
want to bring some sort of revolution
foreign countries believe that by cornering pakistan few hurdles may generate want to support pakistan and also wish to achieve their goal

it has always been a hindu tradition that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is ram
i think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn pakistan
we are ready in all ways the indian chief of army should keep his mouth shut or else we know how to give mouth breaking answers

the prime minister syed raza yusuf geelani said that the newly elected american vice president joe biden played an important role in removing the expresident musharrafs uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy this is why the pakistani government has honored him with a special star
the credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party the parliament is not a rubber stamp
all decisions will be made in the parliament
the prime minister said that qadeers door was closed
in your opinion do the public protests against mina marriot not mean anything

make us aware of your opinion
american president george w bush in his outgoing press conference advised newly elected president barack obama he said that he had made many mistakes in his presidency and that barack obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate
i did as a president whatever i felt was appropriate according to the situation and according to american law and constitution giving preference to american interest over my own acceptance
he said that the enemies of america are still planning to attack and that the biggest challenge for barack obama would be to stop it
he said that not being able to find weapons of mass destruction in iraq was the biggest disappointment for him and considering the iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake
speaking at his last press conference at the white house the american president said that this was his last press conference and he thanked the journalists and other friends who are present
do you think obama will make the same mistakes that bush made
did bush delay accepting his mistakes
will obama be able to follow bushs advice

zubeer khan karachi
this is a very hurtful incident that israel is publicly massacring the palestinians the same situation is here in kashmir but the security council does not even bother with it
as many organizations who are in palestine and kashmir should continue their fight till freedom and by creating unity between themselves keep fighting every kind of aggression one of these days their martyr will bring result by the will of allah
israeli air attacks still continue in gaza as now several palestinian men women and children have been murdered
important political leader hamas nazarian has been martyred with his wife and kids
their meeting of the security council ended without any decision
the condemning resolution presented by libia and other arab countries against israel is facing american opposition in the meeting
for the last few days there have been bombings by israeli planes on the palestinian civilian population
the whole world cried out about the mumbai issue but the israeli attacks do not seem to matter to anyone including america and britain
why are the important islamic countries quiet

i think that most of our people are ignorant they do not know where their money is going the government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties the electricity and gas crisis will not be like this
because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people
the electricity and gas crisis across pakistan has taken a serious position
on the other side there was an increase of an average of 18 in gas rates while the unavailability of petrol in some cities has become a cause of great difficulty for the public
among the manufacturing and business circles there are strong protests and severe protests against the long power cut and gas crisis
industrialists have issued and ultimatum by threatening a shutdown
in karachi people are worried about the 8 to 10 hour load shedding
the industrial sector is almost paralyzed
government institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other
increasing the prices of electricity and gas is not a joke with people
why are the solutions of the problems not considered
is government not seeing the full stop on national development
what immediate steps would you recommend for managing this crisis

after ruling america for 8 years president bush has departed from the white house and shifted to the president camp office in camp david so that the white house can be renovated according to the new president barak obamas likings
during bushs eight years rule the historical attacks and destruction of the world trade center attack on pentagon and then in the name of war against terror attacking afghanistan and iraq and involving forces from other countries into the war and use of american resources in it have become memorable examples of his time
due to this war america itself faced the worst ever economical and financial crisis in history
what do you think the world achieved and lost through this war
were the policies of bush successful
what is your opinion on president bushs rule
the indian government has stopped the indian cricket team from visiting pakistan
the indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests five oneday matches and one 2020 during the tour of pakistan
rajiv shekhla the vice president of the indian cricket board in an interview with jeev news said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the pakistan tour but due to the difficult situation in the two countries the tour was not possible
is the indian governments decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step should sports be separated from politics
is the indian governments decision harmful for cricket
despite the fact that security conditions in india are bad englands cricket team is continuing its tour therefore why cant the indian team make the tour of pakistan
what is your opinion on this
salman karachi
those people who are proud about going to india
and who make their films and videos over there should now have their eyes opened as to how much the people of india respect them
i remember an interview of adnan sami in which he said that he is not pakistani rather his citizenship is of england
adnan sami should come back to pakistan at the first opportunity because he did not get honor there either
farid ahmad
karachi
after the mumbai attacks the mode of the indians have changed
jagjit singh reacted by expressing that he hates pakistan and pakistanis
it should be known that adnan sami has sung with asha bhonsle and how he has become helpless now adnan sami should stay in india there is no need for him to come here
muhammad shamshad aalam
karachi i will only say so much about jagjit singh that he too changes colors like a chameleon
and speaks on the occasion pakistanis open your eyes and see how much you are respected in india do not be dull minded
after the mumbai incident their hate filled speech has increased now they are spreading poison about famous singer adnan sami
after that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards bush president bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself
second shoe hit the american flag
security personnels dragged the journalist away from there
at this point president bush said that he didnt know why he had done so shoe was of number 10 and he didnt had any problem
do you think this reaction of the journalist wasnt an expression of deprecation or president bush from the iraqi people
what would you say on this incident
the tension between pakistan and indias relations after the terrorism in mumbai got further intense when the fighter planes from the indian air force violated the pakistani airspace in lahore and kashmir sectors
as a result of retaliation from pak air force the indian planes were forced to go back
sources say that both indian planes were loaded with ammunition
this is the first incident of this kind in the current tensed situation
pakistan air force says that they are all set for countrys air defense
information minister sherry rahman says that indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed although this happened by mistake
pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious
in your opinion does india really have the intention of an air strike on pakistan
is this statement of india correct was this violation a mistake or was this to find out the ability of pakistan air force
is this incident going to aggravate the current estrangement among the two countries
please inform us with your comments

during a session of general assembly in united nations headquarters former prime minister of pakistan martyr benazir bhutto was presented with this award for acknowledgment of her efforts for human rights in a ceremony
the 60th anniversary of the passing of the human rights resolution by the united nations was celebrated on the 10th of december

samir
chicago
it is true that she was martyred but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in karachi upon which she was proud that nasirullah babar did well
but later she completely changed
it is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party and made her son the representative of the peoples party what kind of democracy is that
jami noor karachi this news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers
but until the iron ax is not fitted with a wooden handle it cannot cut a wing
our rulers are just like this that they are adopting secretive ways this is why calamities are befalling the country
may allah guide our rulers
the security council panel of the united nations have included the name of hafiz saeed as well as two other pakistani citizens and the name of jamaathud dawah as well as four other organisations into the list of terrorists

the member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organisations they will be restricted from traveling and will be under arrest
they will have to face cases
these regulations are not as a result of indian influence are they
why is india blaming these parties for the bombay attacks without any proof
arent there any terrorist groups in india
are international groups not aware of the tortures being committed on the minorities in india
