avoiding dieting can prevent flu
this finding by american scientists has emerged as a result of experiments performed on rats
the experiments proved that the ability to combat the flu virus was lower in rats who were kept on a lowcalorie diet
according to scientists it is better to eat and drink a lot during a fever
researchers from michigan state university say that rats on a low diet were found to have less ability to fight off infection and an increased chance of mortality while rats on a normal diet had greater resistance against the flu virus
according to professor elizabeth gardner people on a diet will not only succumb quickly to the flu but will also take longer to recover
she also says that even people who have taken the flu vaccine should avoid dieting during the winter months
thomas reed who has worked as a weapon designer in americas liver national laboratory wrote this book in cooperation with danny stillman former director of technical intelligence at los alamos national laboratory
in the book entitled nuclear express the political history and spread of the bomb both writers have claimed that any country that has made an atomic bomb has either stolen nuclear secrets from another country or has done so with the support of another nuclear power
during one of the interviews with us news thomas reed said that china tested pakistans first nuclear bomb in 1990 during the time of benazir bhutto
he said that his belief that china tested pakistans first nuclear bomb is based on several reasons
including the design of the bomb and information collected from conversations with chinese scientists
he said that this is why pakistan was able to respond in 1998 to indias nuclear test with their own test only two weeks and three days later
thomas reed reminded the interviewer how when russia conducted a nuclear test in 1961 america responded with its own test only 17 days later despite the fact that it had had the bomb for quite some time
he added that the nuclear bomb which pakistan tested in may 1998 was very carefully made and pakistani scientists had full confidence in it
when thomas reed was asked why china would provide pakistan with nuclear technology he responded that it is because india is a common enemy to both pakistan and china
he said that there is evidence that dr abdul qadir khan used the chinese design and that this was later verified through documents acquired from libya
when asked whether it is common for countries to collaborate in nuclear testing he gave the example of how america expressly conducted a nuclear test for britain in 1990 in the nevada desert
he said they also speculate that israel was provided access to the results of this test
reed was also asked whether china has plans for continued nuclear expansion
he responded that china has been providing raw materials guidelines and designs for nuclear installation in the iranian city of isfahan since 1991
and has provided iran with a production plant in karaj
he said that china has been providing nuclear technology to iran syria pakistan egypt libya and yemen through north korea

819 billion economic recovery package approved
no member of the republican party has voted in favor of president obamas plan
the republican members said that this economic plan is very expensive and will not be effective
in the house of representatives 244 votes were cast in favor of this package and 188 against it
this economic recovery plan is to be presented next week in the senate where the ruling democratic party has a minimal majority
it is feared that due to the republican partys severe opposition its approval by the senate will not be easy
after the approval of the economic recovery plan in the house of representatives barack obama urged the members not to let political differences get in the way of this important plan
the president said that this plan which he hopes will become a law by next month will prove to be helpful in creating a favorable environment in the country for american commerce to thrive
under this plan there will be a bailout in loans of 275 billion for common people and the business community and 540 billion will be given towards roads bridges modernization of 10000 schools unemployment allowance and research of new technologies
bbcs washington correspondent richard lister said that barack obama is determined to put aside political differences and introduce a new political culture but argument over this economic package has once again created bitterness on political grounds
republican party members in the house of representatives declared the bill proposed by the government as a waste of government money and said that it will not help in creating new opportunities for employment
they emphasized the bill proposed by their own party in which more consideration has been given to tax reduction
they said that through their package perhaps more opportunities for employment can be created with less investment
they said that more immediate opportunities for employment can be created by reducing taxes than by a constructive plan
bitterness between israeli president and turkish prime minister
recep tayyip erdogan almost screaming told the israeli president that the blood of many people has been shed in gaza and he was sorry to see that people can applaud the justification for israels invasion
mr erdogan said it seems to me that perhaps you are speaking in such a way even shouting so as to remove your feeling of guilt but you have killed people and i am talking about those children who were killed near the beach
shimon peres said that in gaza it is hamas not israel who has established a dangerous dictatorship there
one bbc correspondent from davos says that this kind of scene has never been witnessed before at the world economic forum
however erdogan said later that he respects the israeli president and his age as well and this was not the reason he shouted at him but rather because what he was saying was far from true
turkey is among the few islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with israel although for the past few years there has been tension between them
when talking to indian channel ndtv wajid shamsul hassan said that pakistans investigative report of the mumbai attacks will be issued soon

india also said that there was a level of pakistani government involvement in the mumbai attacks
relations between the two countries have declined after the mumbai attacks
high commissioner wajid shamsul hassan gave his initial statement regarding pakistans investigation which gives some indication as to what could be in the investigation report
wajid shamsul hassan said so far the investigators have concluded that nothing took place on pakistani soil
it could be any other place with the exception of britain
these two places (pakistan and britain) were the ones that i was worried about
india and the international community have put a lot of pressure on pakistan to take action against those responsible for the mumbai attacks pakistan says it has taken dozens of people into custody in its actions against groups allegedly involved in the mumbai attacks
wajid shamsul hassan said we are not trying to cover it up
we believe in taking action based on facts
our investigation should meet with the worlds approval
we will try to satisfy india with the results (of the investigation)
defending the delay in pakistans investigation he said that collecting examining and understanding this kind of material takes time
high commissioner wajid shamsul hassan said that india took 45 days to present its dossier

role of european union for peace in middle east
when viewed from an official standpoint the role of the european union in the conciliatory efforts to stop the war in the middle east is decisive
according to the official stand of brussels schwarzenbergs delegation or sarkozys efforts are the equivalent to lending a helping hand
amadeu altafaj spokesperson for the european commission said that every effort by which the european commissions concerted message can be sent to warring parties is praiseworthy
as far as its official statement is concerned everything looks fine
but in reality the european union is presenting a sad picture of its own internal tugofwar
as union president the role of the czech republic has already been weak
on top of that internal disputes have rendered it helpless
on the other hand french president sarkozy is acting as though he is still performing the presidential duties of the european union
even though france has completed its sixmonth presidential term
sarkozy wants to play a leadership role and he is certainly capable but he does not have the permission to do so
french foreign minister bernard kouchner is faced with the most ludicrous situation
he is included in the delegation led by czech republics foreign minister schwarzenberg
however both foreign ministers are making different statements about the war in the middle east
schwarzenberg says that israel has the right to defend itself while kouchner thinks that this war cannot be called one of selfdefense meanwhile germany has also sent its own special envoy to the middle east until the european union demonstrates harmony by taking a united stand it cannot achieve success on the diplomatic front
evidence of this is israels conduct which does not show any respect for europes conciliatory efforts
this is a golden opportunity for the european union to do something because america has failed in the middle east due to the policies of george w bush
financial crisis billionaire german industrialists suicide
adolf merckle of southern germanys swabia area has left a large business group behind
but until some time ago the average german citizen did not know much about him
when he had to carry on negotiations for several weeks with the nearly thirty banks who lend money to his industrial group he became the topic of headlines and began to see the future of the merckle group as bleak
the merckle group was forced to suffer millions of euros in losses due to the financial crisis after purchasing shares of the german volkswagen manufacturer
so when financial institutions refused to make new loans of between 700 million and one billion euros to this group which they desperately needed merckle came under intense pressure
just recently the same banks had agreed to provide loans to the merckle group on an emergency basis but adolf merckle who had moved from being a small industrialist to the position that his industrial groups annual income was approximately 30 billion euros could not withstand the deprivation of his strength as a capitalist
when adolf merckle took charge of his familys business after the death of his father he greatly improved the business very quickly through a process of modernization
he named his company ratiopharm now the biggest and most successful pharmaceutical company in germany
until recently the company was worth between 5 and 6 billion euros and it still generates an annual income of 81 billion euros after the tremendous success of ratiopharm the merckle group purchased several large institutions including heidelbergcement a manufacturer of construction materials and kaessbohrer a manufacturer of special vehicles
the number of merckle group employees worldwide is nearly 100000 and the ratiopharm pharmaceutical company has always held a special place amongst its assets
in his life adolf merckle had said on several occasions this is our fourth generation of drug manufacturers
now this companys administration is with my children and i am hopeful that in the coming few hundred years it will remain under my familys administration
after the suicide of adolf merckle banks approved a temporary loan of 400 million euros to his vem group but on the condition that vem will have to sell ratiopharm so that the groups financial situation can be improved over the long term
thus after the death of adolf merckle the merckle group will not be the same as it used to be
crime rate of foreigners in germany
according to joachim herrmann interior minister of the bavarian province this only appears to be a positive change
he said it is necessary to keep in mind that the number of foreigners obtaining german citizenship is increasing
therefore when presenting the statistics this fact should also be made clear that even when the criminal is a german citizen his background may be foreign
herrmann said that in 2010 his province will take this into account when collecting data about criminals
in addition to bavaria thinking is being done along the same lines in the province of hamburg
cdus senator of internal affairs christoph ahlhaus said when research is conducted in a scientific manner one cannot draw up the results he would like to see ahead of time they must depend on the data that emerges from the research
ahlhaus directed attention towards an analytical report from the provincial office of crime prevention prepared in 2006 in which the percentage of foreigners involvement in crime was studied in the bergedorf borough of the city of hamburg
results showed that here
the rate of crimes committed by foreigners is less than the crime rate for the entire province
in contrast when the crime rate amongst adolescents was studied in 2006 in berlin it was seen that the rate of adolescents with foreign background was
447 percent
however other german political parties such as spd the environmentalist party garbanz and the leftwing party linkspartei are opposed to the idea of determining which german citizens have foreign background when gathering crime data

al qaedas video message for germany
in this thirtyminute video a person wearing a black turban covering his face and carrying a gun in his hand is sending a message to the german government
the man introduces himself with the name abu talha and speaks in german
the video message also has arabic subtitles
the al qaeda logo appears on the side of the screen and the video is dated october 2008
in the message it is stated to the german government that if by stationing military in such large numbers in afghanistan their country means to express its belief that it will not be attacked what could be more nave
the person calling himself abu talha did not threaten to attack germany directly however
currently the number of german troops included in the united nato army in afghanistan is approximately 3500
last year in october the german parliament approved a decision to send 1000 more troops to afghanistan
this is the first message received by germany from al qaeda
regarding the message mikhail lders a distinguished expert on matters of terrorism says the recent suicide attack outside the german embassy in kabul is evidence that we should take this very seriously
for the past few years al qaeda has been sending video messages on the internet and these kinds of messages have been followed by attacks
on saturday the militant taliban organization claimed responsibility for the suicide attack outside the german embassy in kabul
most german newspapers and advisors consider this attack to be related to the al qaeda message
they are making germany a target
fundamentalist muslims have a negative and critical view of germanys afghan policy
they accuse the german government of adopting biased policies not only in afghanistan but in the middle east as well
and for this reason they very much consider germany to be their target
in the meantime the german government says that even before this video surfaced german intelligence was already aware of it
the german federal crime prevention organization is busy examining this video message

chinese political expert gosoi wu active in the german city of bochum says
in this respect i am sure that in the coming weeks and months obama and his economic team will apply great pressure and force the beijing government to set an exchange rate that is flexible and in accordance with the market for the chinese currency
the former american administration has further strengthened the relations with india also
where can obama take these relations regarding this new delhis professor of american studies christopher raj says now we have come closer in a strategic partnership but obama cannot make any change overnight

afghanistan voter registration in jeopardy
afghanistans election commission has said that due to safety concerns they are delaying voter registration in some southern areas
voter registration began this week for the upcoming presidential election in southern afghanistan
but the commission has said that until the security situation better improves voters will not be able to register themselves in some areas of helmand province
since last year there has been an increase in violence in these southern areas where taliban rebels have increased their attacks on the afghan and international armies
meanwhile the afghan and international armies have said that on the night between wednesday and thursday they killed at least 28 militants during skirmishes all over afghanistan
nato has said that its armies killed 22 militants in air and land attacks in the eastern khost province near pakistans border

north west frontier province government rejected demand for ban on girls education in swat
north west frontier province authorities have rejected the threat from taliban militants in swat to impose a ban on girls education saying that this announcement is against both the law and islam
on sunday sardar hussain babak the north west frontier provinces minister of education went on to say that the government will never let such attempts succeed
he said that extremists are trying to deprive children in our area of education
in his words these people secretly try to blow up schools and threaten boys and girls
acknowledging the atmosphere of fear and terror he said that the provincial government is well aware of this and wants to make it clear that no force can stop the promotion of education in the land of the pakhtoons
one day earlier under the leadership of maulana fazlullah taliban militants demanded that a ban be placed on girls education in swats educational institutions starting january 15 and threatened that educational institutions that fail to comply will be destroyed
in spite of continued army activity in swat during the past one and a half years militants have destroyed about 150 educational institutions using explosive materials and arson
as a result of destroying these educational institutions girls and boys numbering in the thousands have been deprived of any access to education

tea an effective treatment for breast cancer
new research has found that drinking three cups of tea daily
decreases the risk of breast cancer in women under 50 years of age by more than a third
this research conducted in the american state of floridas moffitt cancer center has found that for women less than 50 years of age the risk of breast cancer tumors
research has also found that drinking three or more cups of tea daily does not hold any particular benefit in this respect for elderly women
experts think that the reason for this is the presence in tea of some ingredients that are more effective against those particular cancerous tumors that most commonly occur in women under fifty years of age
in florida states moffitt cancer center in the city of tampa this research was conducted on more than 5000 women who had been treated for breast cancer
experts compared their medical records and lifestyles to women who did not have breast cancer
experts also found that on a special type of cancer lobular tea had a significant effect causing as much as 66 percent decrease
almost one in ten breast cancer patients has this type
this type of cancer is more dangerous because it is deep and is commonly discovered after it has already spread a lot
experts say that by regularly drinking at least three cups of tea everyday the risk of breast cancer can be lowered significantly in young women
they say that including tea as an everyday drink in your everyday routine creates adequate immunity in the body against cancer
in britain every year almost 40000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer
war in afghanistan is the biggest military challenge facing america gates
american secretary of defense robert gates has said that the war in afghanistan is the biggest military challenge facing america
today gates was briefing the american senate and members of the house of representatives on the strategy of the obama administration regarding the war in afghanistan and iraq
gates told the senates armed services committee that war alone is not the solution to the problem of afghanistan but he went on to say that there are not enough soldiers present to make many areas safe a situation which the taliban takes advantage and exploits
why a decrease in exercise with age
new research
exercise is good for the health at every age
it makes your heart stronger lowers cholesterol levels helps in keeping weight low helps prevent diabetes and slows down the progress of alzheimers or senility
unfortunately in many people the ability to exercise decreases as age increases
experts say that exercise keeps our body and mind alert although age can have an effect on this
the american medical association says that not exercising can lead to several health problems
dr patricia pellikka of the mayo clinic in minnesota says that increased age is a big reason behind an inability to exercise and a decrease in the bodys performance
doctor patricia teaches medicine at the mayo clinic
she headed a study about heart disease and the ability of humans to exercise in old age
a team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to examine the performance of the heart
in which the hearts pumping of blood its phases of contraction and relaxation was observed
experts have focused their attention on the left side of the heart the side which pumps the blood
they found that an increase in age is accompanied by an increase in problems in the relaxation phase of the heart
dr patricia says that with increased age the problems in the relaxation phase of the heart become prominent and their effect on the ability to exercise gets worse
dr garvan kane was a part of this study
he says that we were surprised to see that this thing has a compulsory effect which explained how much a poor performance in exercise can be related to the relaxation phase of the heart
many times blood pressure can become a cause for problems in the functioning of the heart and heart diseases
if doctor and patient work together to deal with heart problems they can still benefit from exercise in spite of increasing age
a detailed report about this has been published in the journal of the american medical association
no possibility of immediate war with pakistan indian army chief
indian army chief general deepak kapoor says that there are no possibilities of immediate war with pakistan however to defend the country and ensure the protection of its interests we are always ready to make sacrifices
general kapoor made the accusation that in spite of international pressure on pakistan as a result of assurances and the mumbai attacks in his words not only does the specter of terrorism remain intact in the land of pakistan it is active
he made this remark in sri nagar while speaking with reporters
the indian army chief was on a oneday tour of the valley of kashmir to examine kashmirs overall defensive situation which is under management by new delhi and the readiness of armed forces on the borders
he was questioned whether he has any comment about how according to media reports pakistan has rejected the evidence presented from india regarding the mumbai attacks
general kapoor said that decisions regarding matters of war and peace are made by the political leadership
allegedly mentioning the specter of terrorism being present in the land of pakistan he said that the indian army will be competing against those elements that are determined to upset peace and weaken india
he said that in indian kashmir there are up to seven to eight hundred militants of which approximately fifty percent are foreigners
general deepak kapoor said that only with an improvement in weather can infiltration efforts can be increased by pakistan and the part of kashmir under its control however india has increased vigilance on the borders
he rejected the possibility of reducing the number of armed forces stationed in indiancontrolled kashmir saying that the countrys safety cannot be compromised
may allah bless what the world is saying and may barack prove to be a blessing for the world
although there is no hope but still lets see to what extent pakistan and americas relations turn in our favor as a result of this change
what reality would barack who is a reality of martin luther kings dream give to the world
as obama whose name also has hussein as part of it takes oath as the president of america today it is in all ways not only an event of historical significance but also a hard test of history
not just for his own race but for all those people who gave their full support
this will also be a test for the white majority for which taking a black as their president would not be easy to accept
those people here in south asia especially muslims who have attached hopes to him should remember that he is the president of america and obama should remember that americas president is practically the president of the whole world
today a few moments from now a representative whose racial brethren were brought in shackles from their native lands to america who strengthened the roots of modern days most powerful land with their hard work who suffered racial biases will become americas 44th president
many people have a lot of expectations from this one person
his supporters have an obligation to not attach unrealistic expectations to this man
if obama succeeds in somehow bringing down hatred based on race and religion and other such factors it would be a victory of his supporters
how would this change affect south asia and in this regard can some meaningful change be expected in the american policy
how would this change affect the relations between pakistan and america
my dear be it obama or anyone else it is the influential strong and the billionaire jewish lobby that decides the kind of direction that the whole worlds policy and relations would take
and as far as pakistan is concerned the whole world can see the offensive attitude of india israel and americas triangle about the recent mumbai blasts
for a long time after pakistan came into being the responsibility for swat remained in the hands of the guardian of swat who had his own army and law
he handed over the administration of swat to the pakistani government according to an agreement
but sadly our government treated swat like a step mother
after the rule of the guardian of swat ended there was no increase in the number of schools at all
and nobody took interest in the development and progress of the area
the number of girls acquiring education today is far less than those who went to school in that period
local taliban continues to target educational institutes in pakistans north west frontier province
highest number of schools have been destroyed in swat district of which the majority were girls schools
not just this taliban has also announced a ban on the education of girls in swat
thousands of male and female students are being deprived of education
what do you think the taliban are trying to achieve by stopping girls from getting educated
why has the government been unsuccessful in putting an end to these lawless acts
what in your opinion should the government do
the question should be what would isi and the pakistani agencies get
because the people of swat now understand the game which is that the army is there to serve the taliban and not to hurt them otherwise how could five schools be blown up in one night during a curfew or how could people be slaughtered and hung at the main square of the city while the curfew was still on
if the government is not being allowed to establish its rule in swat then how can the government succeed in putting an end to these activities that are against the law
now the question is raised that when the government has an army modern and powerful weapons modern technology and spying system etc then why can these four taliban not be controlled
the answer to this is that they have the protection of some secret benefactor which enables them to neither run out of weapons nor get caught
the essence of the whole discussion is that the taliban because of their own misdeeds are making the work of the imperialists of the world easy
fifteen years ago war was on in afghanistan
isi was controlling the taliban while in opposition were the northern alliance who were being helped by russia india and iran
then suddenly the situation changed and the talibans bad behavior was exposed
and isi also got an offer of dollars from america which changed the old friends into enemies
now the situation is that the war is still on but the countries providing aid in pakistan are the same iran india and russia
unless a person realizes what is right and what is wrong they continue to err
for instance if someone goes to steal and realizes at that moment that theft is not a good thing and its a curse it entails punishment and they are also afraid of god they would not steal
similarly until israel realizes that it is wrong and it is killing innocent people and that it will be punished for it it will recklessly continue shedding the blood of innocents in gaza
greetings
the question is that is war an armed movement and terrorism a solution to problems
if not then what is the secret formula that can guide to a solution of these problems
its true that war or an armed struggle does not solve any problems it rather increases them
in order for palestine afghanistan and iraq to be successful in their political process they should follow the same model that nelson mandela employed in south africa
this means engaging in a struggle that is more political and moral instead of armed and requires reconciliation
participation of the kashmiris in the election shows that they have accepted this point
this is the third week of the israeli raids on gaza and the death toll has reach almost a thousand
despite international diplomatic efforts there hasnt been a ceasefire yet
and according to one estimate after these attacks which started on the 27 of december 90 thousand palestinians have left their homes to move to safer areas
aid agencies have accused israel of ignoring the issue of the safety of palestinian children saying that it is making a whole generation of children suffer from grave psychological and emotional problems
what do you say
how is stable peace possible in gaza

the taliban should be given an opportunity
basit peshawar
wake up if the taliban were to conduct real jihad who would be left to slaughter innocent people
who would set fire to the girls schools
and who would kidnap for ransom or on not getting the ransom who would hang people from poles calling them american spies
these taliban have done more harm to islam than any nation or religion has done
pashtun roar
kohat pakistan
if the whole islamic world together just threatens israel that it would be attacked you will see how israels daddy america would feel the pain
and immediately not only will the talk of ceasefire follow but ceasefire will actually take place
but what can be done where would our muslim leaders find such courage
someone should suggest to ahmadinejad to take the first step as he is famous for his fearlessness in the bbc forum
maintaining peace and taking care of human rights is not just the responsibility of the arabs or the muslim world it is the duty of all the countries to raise their voice against injustice
this sad incidence is the worst among the sins committed by bush
american administration has given a green signal to israel indicating that it can do whatever it wants just like looting and plundering is done in government organizations in pakistan and india when the financial year ends on june 30
on the one hand america says that efforts would be made for a ceasefire
on the other the united nations is passing resolution after resolution but really both have not done anything only one conclusion can be drawn and that is the united nations is also determined to crush the muslims
all muslim countries should discontinue their membership in the united nations and lay the foundation for their own international organization
we have many instances where america and united nations just made promises and passed resolutions it was only the muslims who suffered
what is the use of pretending if the bbc is not going to publish anything
what has happened to all the journalistic principles when innocent blood is shed especially of a muslims the bbc loudly professes neutrality
selfproclaimed bearers of truth
forget about commenting themselves their smallmindedness wont allow them to print comments
the only difference between you and the jews is that they call themselves jews and while living amongst you kill you and while living among muslims like you and calling yourself muslim to the muslims
syja786
for a long time a particular country has been targeted at the bbc forum behind the cover of the suicide attacks or terrorist activities in india for quite some time using suicide attacks and terrorism in india as an excuse a particular faith has been targeted in the bbc forums
extremism is the favorite word in these antiislam discussions
but from the discussion above you can easily guess who the extremist is in it writing against iran has virtually been decreed as blasphemous
when will our muslim brethren understand that the sword cannot be used to vanquish tyranny
watching israel bomb unarmed people is that not a heartwrenching experience
fundamentally the blame can be placed on this conflict murder and destruction which we call jihad and thereby besmirch the beautiful name of islam
when the majority of palestinians have accepted the existence of israel then why does hamas attack israel with rockets or target it with suicide bombers
the attitudes of both sides are not humanitarian
once again we see america and the united nations supporting the injustices of israel
may allah grant the muslim global community the will to be united amen
and the real terrorists using these painful acts of terrorism against terrorism should be considered for a nobel prize as after all they are the ones doing the real work
otherwise how is terrorism on such a large scale possible without the backing of some bigwig and everyone knows who the people pulling these strings are
so simply put this is called gangsterism do whatever you please
hit on the head with full force and then dont even let weep over it inflicting allaround abuse and wont let you complain either
the arab leaders are giving medicines to the injured coffins for the dead and money and the question is being raised
what should be done about israeli attacks
the actual problem is that the leaders of all muslim countries including the saudi kings are in a dream world and neither do they have an army nor a defense plan they think that by providing aid they have fulfilled their responsibility
they should immediately take some practical steps against israel
like stopping the supply of petroleum to america and the european countries however regretfully they
greetings to all sisters and brothers
in my opinion during these difficult times suggesting that hamas give up its struggle in the name of peace would be unfair to the thousands of widows and millions of orphans and would be akin to failing them
if israel and its supporters are pretending to be like the pharaohs then soon moses will be born among them because this is the law of nature the steps that america and israel are taking are the propagators of suicide bombers among the muslims
which these elephants intoxicated with power cannot understand
abu abdullah pakistan
now hamas and israel should make peace so that this bloodshed comes to an end
muhammad sarfaraz paris france
absolutely correct
let us suppose that hamas is 100 percent right and that by conducting jihad against oppression it wants to obtain high esteem in the presence of god even so it should at least realize that if good deeds cause the destruction of flourishing communities then they do not remain a good deeds
for those who claim to love god his prophet and their religion the love of humanity is an essential part of their beliefs
as if subsequent to the coming of muslims allah has ordered all those who follow the judeochristian scriptures to be wiped off the face of the earth
najeeburrehman saiko lahore pkitn
no the order is not for them to be wiped off rather they should be invited into islam
but jihad has been ordered against those who scheme against the religion
these people should be fought until they give up scheming but this does not at all mean that one should wear a jacket and blow oneself up in a crowd
brothers the end of the murder of innocent children is destruction
however i want to suggest to my friends that the same israelis who yesterday could find no refuge today have become so strong that they listen to no one because they are united
they have no such differences as shia and sunnis they are all just jews and they have progressed and have been creative in every field
in contrast what is the condition of the 55 islamic countries
lagging behind in every field and now the situation is that they have become so helpless that the enemy is relentlessly beating them and they await death
there is a need for all muslim countries to unite and together prepare a strategy against israel
feroz magsi jhang pakistan
there is no better strategy than to accept israel as a state and to acquire from it the latest knowledge and ways of advancement and let the world live in peace
muslims have a lot of land and resources as well
there is a need to use them effectively
the first and foremost distressing aspect is that hamas and fatah could not unite
great leaders like yasir arafat and sheikh yasin were killed in an organized fashion so that this one brave nation of the region capable of conducting jihad for the aqsa mosque could be weakened and this was not possible without eliminating yasin and arafat
the world is witnessing how palestine is gradually falling apart after the demise of these two leaders
and how the jewish lobby strengthens its stranglehold with every passing moment
in 1974 there was a pakistani prime minister who had such global prestige that he for the first time brought all muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance
today on his eightyfirst birthday is it so difficult for this nation to pledge that not only would it have unity among its ranks
moreover while working to remove the differences among other muslims it will work to complete its (the foundation of the islamic commonwealth) partially completed mission
this is an evil spirit which has taken possession of palestine for half a century
this evil spirit has many faces
a number of times this evil spirit has used one of its faces to badmouth itself in order to get relief from the worlds pressure and move attention away from itself
and some of the faces of this evil spirit are devouring men in iraq afghanistan iran and pakistan
and this evil spirit is most fearful of islam because it knows that whenever it is forced out it will only happen because of islam muslims and their religion in its complete and practical form that is because history tells us that islam brought onto the right track a number of famous ignorants
israeli warplanes have continued their bombing and missile attacks on gaza since december 27
so far more than 300 palestinian citizens have lost their lives in these attacks
after the air raids israeli tanks and armorplated vehicles have reached the border of gaza with full preparation for a land attack
the united nations security council passed a unanimous resolution at an emergency meeting calling on israel and the palestinian authority to immediately stop their violent acts
however israeli authorities say that they will continue their actions in gaza till they are sure that rocket attacks on israel will cease
in your opinion is israel right in saying that the action it is taking is part of israeli efforts to defend its sovereignty
in this situation is the international community playing its role
is this brutal act indirectly linked to the upcoming elections in israel
can some improvement in the state of affairs of the middle east be expected after the newly elected president obama takes charge

palestine will always be a sacred place for muslims of the whole world and its protection is our duty
and we should also remember that it was designated as our first geographical orientation for performing our prayers
and israel india and america will be destroyed one day because these countries were always meant to disintegrate god will surely direct his wrath on these infidels sajid sadiq lahore
when did tears help in spending the night of separation when have tears assuaged the night of separation
when was a calamity evaded simply by prayers (nawabzada nasrullah khan)
bbc looks far and wide to find such comments in order to publish them
after all the facade of impartiality has to be maintained too
actually bbcs news is generally correct but the real thing is the way this news is presented
some things are highlighted and certain news items are given less significance
etc etc
zaheer chughtai
in the use of these tricks now our own pakistani electronic and print media especially some urdu newspapers and columnists etc are not behind anyone else in their coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or on writing about these they bring in their own pet peeves and grudges
where is the united nations which on the face of it speaks of human rights and peace but when intense force and injustice is inflicted on muslims it just repeats the same thing that hamas should stop its attacks till when will this inconsistent policy continue
why such oppression of muslims if people like america stop backing the jews allah has clearly said that this nation would spend the life of a disgraced nation and this nation can never live normally so americans if you have the guts stop supporting them and then see their fate
the socalled arbiters of the world and those who kill and destroy others in the name of peace should clearly understand that peace can only be established in the world by being just and not by being unfair and through genocide
if genocide was a sure way to eliminate a whole race and have ones way not only would the jews have not existed after the steps that hitler took but their rise today would have been impossible
as a poet says
cruelty is cruelty after all it inflates then it dissipates
blood is blood after all it drips then it coagulates
now who will explain to whom the meaning of terrorism
does everyone not come under the category of terrorism why does everyone only feel their own pain
are other people not human or is it that the blood of muslims has now become so cheap wasnt the blood of so many innocents red
and now why doesnt a condolence message come from anywhere anymore
i watched the mumbai attack operations as if my own house was on fire it is not easy to watch human suffering and this suffering is not visible to anyone i wish muslims could unite and then think
how to protest the corpses lying on the road unattended injured and innocent faces soaked in blood cannot find words
feel like crying over the helplessness of muslims on the one hand whenever people are killed in india the whole world starts blaming pakistan without any proof asking it to take action otherwise they will take the initiative
on the other israel is openly conducting genocide of the muslims and the world is silent this is unbearable
god acts on his own timetable and when he does to end this lawlessness
while america exists a threat to israels existence should be considered a joke
as far as the elections are concerned those in power will take such measures as to please the people and without a doubt especially a state like israel as far as barack obama is concerned history is a witness that no american president to date has gone against the ruling policy and this will not even happen an imperialist whether black or white is an imperialist
the ongoing debate in the forum shows that everyone is sad about benazirs demise however considering her as a politician her failings have not been ignored
it is being debated whether benazir gave away her life for democracy or to gain power
if democracy was dear to her then why was she free for ten years until a deal was made to obtain american clearance under musharrafs authoritarian rule
benazir did not come to pakistan when the people subject to authoritarianism needed her unfortunately she came to pakistan after being acquitted in law suits and when she was assured of her power
there is no one to respond to the blame and criticism constantly being leveled at a historical figure
sana khan
some things are just ignored because one feels that nothing can be done about them
another reciter
dear sirmadam perhaps you did not just read the history of (sir) in pakistan but also in four friendly countries and seven other countries perhaps you agree with mr saiko
tariq ayaz
those who are not talented will not benefit from training
the image of cypress trees did not appear green in the water
britain never allowed them to unite and concocted a hindumuslim feud which was nurtured by sir syed
saiko
how cruel are our people blindly writing odes to celebrate themselves and their party and no one to defend the historical figures and intellectuals who are being accused and criticized willynilly
we have made entirely too much progress
sana khan
some things are just ignored thinking that nothing can be done about them like loading books on a donkey does not turn it into a scholar
even if the ongoing dialogue between pakistan and india has been disturbed after the mumbai attacks both countries should continue the dialogue
if they think of going to war then both sides will lose human lives
india says that the person they arrested for the mumbai attacks is a pakistani national and he had also sent a letter in urdu to pakistan however it is significant to note that initially when indian authorities arrested this extremist they claimed that he was an accomplished engineer but later they said that his education was only at the fourth grade level something to be determined
first of all merry christmas to mr bahana and all the christian friends of the forum
forum friends mr saiko a raza sister sana sister shaihda akram and everyone greetings
we do not want the flames of war rather the flowers of peace
war itself is a problem
what problems will war solve
today it will result in fire and blood
tomorrow it will result in hunger and depravation
this is why thoughtful people
it is better if we keep war at bay
in your yard and ours
its better if we light a candle
americas relations with india have become quite strong and india surely knows that if the time comes america will openly betray pakistan
this is also evident from american history
and in the case of an indian attack america will achieve its goals while india will foot the bill
pakistan should make it clear that we would not initiate war but if an invasion takes place then discussion of treaty peace and ceasefire will not take place until india is completely destroyed or occupied even if this means our own destruction
this is islamic history
even before this resolution came to pass the pakistani people and army have conveyed whatever message they wanted to
indias efforts to gain undue diplomatic and military advantage as a compensation for the mumbai attacks have made it appear to be a clever rather than effective party this is why after the initial strong international reaction now the world has reduced its pressure on pakistan
ignoring the needless fuss created by india the united nations expression of satisfaction over pakistans efforts and interpols presidents commendation of pakistani efforts are the fallout of indias diplomatic efforts rather than its need
there is no disagreement that this act is an extremely corrupt act
but the question is when thousands of taliban attacked the village of peer samiullah where was the pakistani army and what was it doing
should the army not be held accountable for whatever it did out there in a whole year
how many taliban are being killed by the thousands of mortars and bombs that they drop everyday
and put an end to this fake operation
the day is not far away when a united nations resolution relating to armed intervention in pakistan will pass just like the way one was passed against jamatuddaawa
to begin with our extremists and their supporters themselves are constantly providing proofs and reasons for action against themselves and whenever such a resolution is passed there is a great possibility that no one will raise their voice at the united nations in support of us
and even if there is some delay in the passing of the resolution one country or another will follow the example of america and attack us on their own
we do not have much familiarity with the personality and achievements of peer samiullah and we do not have information about what his activities were
probably he was not a revolutionary
the way comrade che guevara nawab akbar khan bugti dr najibullah and the bodies of thousands of dead revolutionaries have been desecrated at the hands of the enemies
they are immortal even after death
but here an international game is being played here people are being ruled by fear inculcated through barbarism and bestiality
this is to justify their rule that is if they do not rule then such barbarians and beasts will rule
this act which has been performed by islamists in the name of religion is highly condemnable
the supporters of these extremists can see the tyranny of america but instead of feeling sorry about such acts they excuse them by labeling them as tribal customs
no sensitive person can cover such a brutal act in the name of tribal customs or in the name of religion
i think people from our armed forces are in cahoots with them
when these people move from one place to another it takes some time during which they can be captured but the army leaves the place even if its there let alone capturing them during their movement
are those people so fearless that they keep 50 to 70 people as hostages and our army watches the show
they are creatures of allah and so is our army
its clear that there is something fishy going on
the great dictator of his time ziaulhaq due to his authoritarianism instead of highlighting the compassionate and merciful attributes of god created an atmosphere of fear and terror for the faith through the discussions of the variety of forms of gods wrath and punishments the incidence of the hanging corpse and books titled what will happen after death produce fear and terror
and these people are using fear and terror as the tools for obtaining worldly profits gains and grandeur
waazu
you are the one who planted the fear of hell fire among all
its amazing when it is said that this cannot be the work of a muslim
we are ignorant of our own history or we intentionally do not want to face it
was the attack of the army of yazeed on madina or the incidence of karbala the work of the hindus or the jews
without accepting the truth the motives have neither been understood nor have they been addressed
bbc end your twofaced policy
a better topic than this was it appropriate to hit bush with shoes or not
should it have happened
tahir chaudhry japan
friend show some shame a man was dug out of a grave and hanged on a pole because he raised his voice against injustice and all you can think of is the topic of the box office
for operation lionhearts success and its success on the other side of the border depends on which side the common people are inclined to support
this is the work of american and pakistani agencies and friend peer has been a victim of their scheme
all the comments made in this forum now will be against the taliban because secret agents have successfully infiltrated the ranks of the taliban and are taking steps to change public opinion
what i would like to ask is that while this dead body was hanging there for a whole day what were the soldiers doing there do they only sit there to target civilians and then the way they issue a statement like this taliban hideouts attacked a mother and her three kids killed when the house was bombed
did they not know about this square
or were they watching the show
we plead and beg for gods sake put an end to this game
lest you forget there is also someone who is watching over you
a question was put forth by bbc whether appropriate or not but the superficiality of it was disheartening for instance no one asked the question as to what the 30000 armed troops in swat have gone there to accomplish
the corpses of those who fight the taliban and support the army dangle all day long from the poles
whatever was done to the people of swat by the cursed pakistani army they did but the media including the bbc did not do any good by hiding the truth from the world
the pakistani army is staging a play
every child of swat is saying that this is a bloody drama
for gods sake end the drama
these taliban have given muslims a bad name
if true muslims in the whole world do not consider them muslims then why do these terrorists find refuge in their own area
those who have become shameless who do not want to work hard get guns and join their groups
you should be ashamed
the answer to this cannot be found in any religion or any family tradition
the whole media including the bbc is speculating about the taliban and the tribes using different sources
but nobody knows what the actual situation is we know because we ourselves are tribesmen
in short this is a game in which the cia raw mosad and our own isi are involved there are no taliban or tribesmen there are terrorist who have been created to give a bad name to islam taliban madrasahs pashtun people tribes and the tribal customs
this behavior has brought shame to the muslims
i salute mqms chief altaf husain anp and ppp who are speaking up about this cancer ie the taliban
this cancer is a product of ziaulhaq he died but ruined pakistan
but i am hopeful that the present leadership will eliminate this cancer
india after the mumbai attacks has declared that a few extremist elements from pakistan were involved in them
pakistan has refuted these allegations saying that it will provide as much help to india in the investigations as it can
india has stated that it has given a list of twenty suspected terrorists to pakistan who are wanted by india
now pakistan has said that jaishemohammads leader maulana masood azhar who is also included in this list has not been detained and the pakistani government has no information about him
earlier pakistans president asif ali zardari dismissed the impression that western secret service agencies and the indian government have provided proofs about the mumbai attacks to pakistan
president zardari said that whether ajmal kasab is from pakistan or not hasnt been proved yet
meanwhile prime minister manmohan singh has warned pakistan that its relations with india cannot improve while it keeps using indias land for terrorist activities
and in the recent developments the indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to pakistan
should these political events affect sports
how do you see the future of the relations between pakistan and india
pakistan would be broken neither by america nor by india
pakistanis themselves would break pakistan
what do you expect after so much provincialism and sectarianism
time has also proved that jinnah did not do any good to the muslims of india
yasmin chicago
madam had work continued on the vision of mr jinnah neither the cancer of provincialism nor sectarianism would have spread in pakistan and india would not have treated muslims like this
but the fault lies with us that we could not create a leader like him
if we cannot value our heroes than
this region does have a lot of talent
god knows when they will get smart and when this region will prosper with the blessing of unity
in both countries mullahs pundits taliban shiv sena rss etc have been mobilized to oppose peace
and the forces of tyranny do not want this region to prosper with peace so they make these countries dance to their tune
can you imagine what position this region would occupy in the world if pakistan india and china were to come to an agreement
the curse of god has fallen on pakistan as thieves plunderers and blackmailers have been imposed on the country as leaders
may allah always keep our country pakistan safe amen
but sir open your eyes and look around at the ground realities and you will realize to what point the american forces have reached
apart from this the national situation also does not look right the situation in nwfp balochistan and karachi in sindh is right in front of you
in such circumstances the country needs a leader who can unite us as a nation
oh allah have mercy on us
i think there is no option but a final war
enough is enough
it should go this way or the other
these hypocritical pretensions of having a dialog will not solve any problem
neither will small acts of terrorism in each others countries
after all europe only calmed down after the last world war
had this great war not taken place they would have been bickering like pakistan and india do till today
almost all of our political parties agree that terrorism and sectarianism should end in the country
but our armed forces leadership does not seem sincere about this on the one hand america and europe are assured that we are with them in this war against terrorism on the other the taliban are also secretly provided with help
now we have to think and make a decision about our direction and choose only one way thanks
there is no doubt that a majority of the active members of lashkaretayaba joined jamiatuddaawa after lashkaretayaba was banned
after that these activists gave priority to providing aid and on the strong insistence of india the united nations has banned it too and the pakistani government has also continued to crackdown against them
i think it would be much better if these jihadi groups abandon religious extremism and continue with religious and welfare activities
the terrorist organizations present in pakistan that have been sustaining criminals in the name of jihad they and the leaders of these mullahs are the same people who call pakistan land of the filthy and other bad names
now they are not leaving any stone unturned to destroy pakistan
actually far from being called muslims they do not deserve even to be called humans
without ridding pakistan of these troublemakers national security is in danger
is there still a need to think about whether or not these conflict instigators should be banned
there is no place in the world for such violent mullahs whose job is only to kill
this is heartbreaking news
what a world this is that makes life miserable for someone who invokes an important principle of islam the religion of allah
nonmuslims can kill muslims but if muslims even try to take revenge then the whole nonmuslim world together with our hypocrite leaders treats those who are honest and selfless and who care for the religion as they are treating our great leader hafiz saeed today
india as a consequence of the mumbai attacks
tension has resulted in relations with pakistan and the current improvement in the relations between both the countries gained over the years has been setback
india has constantly held the militant and nonmilitant groups in pakistan accountable
the return of the relations to normality is being attributed to the action that was taken against these groups
meanwhile indian security organizations have directly accused lashkaretayaba for being the perpetrator of the mumbai attacks
in relation to this jamiatuddaawas name is also being brought up again and again
this is not the first time that the relations between both countries have been strained by some terrorist activity in india
in december 2001 after the attack on the indian parliament both countries had come to the brink of a war
following this in 2002 lashkaretayaba was banned and its name was added to the list of terrorist groups
now there is a demand to ban jamiatuddaawa which according to security analysts is the new face of lashkaretayaba
in your opinion should this group be banned or not
should pakistan carry out a decisive operation against the hotheaded extremist groups that are active on its land
can the banning of jamiatuddawa and the current india
pak crisis be evaded and how important is it for armed groups to be abolished for stable peace between the two nations
the united nations security council has banned jamiatuddaawa after all what proof does the security council have that it acted in such a hurry
doesnt the security council always act expeditiously against muslims
this is called the nonchalant plaintiff and the zealous witness
one can observe that india itself has become a failed state
those whose intelligence army and other security agencies have failed who were kept helpless by a few the terrorists for 72 hours and india wants to fool the entire world by blaming its failure on pakistan
when a nonmuslim is killed there is hue and cry in the whole world why this double standard
the only nonpolitical religious welfare organization of our beloved country
furqan faruq faisalabad
during the time of our prophet (pbuh) saints and sufis when love and respect for all humans prevailed the religion of islam spread peacefully and flourished
muslims also progressed in all areas
but when this beautiful religion went into the hands of extremism men started differentiating between muslims and nonmuslims and new chapters of conflict and controversy started to open which the world was not aware of before this
greetings go ahead sir take this action but do it on your own
do not do it because of americas pressure
if india has problems should it provide proof
why doesnt it
and why does it blame everything on us
there are extremist groups and organizations even in india why dont these people put a ban on them
are we the only terrorists in the whole world
what is it that india is doing in kashmir
what is it that israel is doing
the truth is that we are the worlds first islamic country with nuclear power is that what the whole fuss is about
pakistan is at the final stages now
kamran hassan abu dhabi
your point makes sense and the situation bears it out
now american magazines are boldly publishing pakistans new map and these bans also seem to be related to the same issue
americans are quickly rather than gradually strengthening their grip on pakistan
under such conditions if we as a nation do not display unity and harmony then remember that if bangladesh could be created then much more can happen
one cannot condemn terrorist attacks enough whether they take place in mumbais hotel or in islamabads marriot hotel or in palestine
similarly terrorists should be destroyed regardless of where they are from pakistan india america or israel
now the question arises why is the world including the pakistani government silent in the face of terrorist attacks in pakistan everyday in which hundreds of people lose their lives
was the marriot attack not done by terrorists
why then
may i sacrifice myself for the interior minister mr rehman malik by the grace of allah how brave and fearless the man has become
not just this according to the bbc mr malik has also very forcefully called this impression wrong that the arrests of terrorists are being made on someones demand
wow glory be to allah
possessing or not possessing the capability or saying it is not wanted
whose war are we the pakistanis fighting
and why do we also have interests that we will try to protect with all our might
nobody has the right to intervene in a countrys affairs
it doesnt seem to be a period of colonization
if people expect justice or the allies insist on an independent judiciary and respect democratic institutions and do not assist any dictator or army peace will be established in third world pakistan which might not be acceptable to the allies
pakistan is working anyway to achieve the aims of europe and america
this in spite of the opposition of a majority of the population of pakistan
and this fuels more feelings against it
if america and its allies have confidence in democracy they should abandon the policy of a colonizer respect the countrys sovereignty and go away from the region
pakistan has the capability to arm or disarm itself
security forces raided an alleged camp of the banned lashkaretayaba in the pakistani controlled area of kashmir
after the mumbai attacks increasing pressure is being placed on pakistan to speed up its actions against extremist organizations
india accuses lashkaretayaba of involvement in the mumbai attacks
they say that the extremists who attacked mumbai undoubtedly used pakistani territory
meanwhile authorities in peshawar say that another center for the trucks that take goods to the allied forces in afghanistan was destroyed by fire by unknown armed men destroying more than fifty trucks
in the past 48 hours this is the second attack on the nato and american supplies in peshawar
in the meantime pakistan has raided an alleged camp of the banned lashkaretayaba efforts were made even before this to disarm the armed groups from karachi to the tribal areas and those who surrendered their arms were assured that compensation would be given to them and that no action would be taken against them
the question is does pakistan want to do this
does pakistan have the capacity to do this
what do you say
click here for details
(please note that because of a large number of comments only the comments typed in urdu will be published)
(press to select urdu altshift on the onscreen board)
i have only one question for all the flagbearers of humanity
if you kill their children will they welcome you with garlands for you this is impossible
and my question to you is do the teachings of islam or those of the east or west give any logic philosophy or reasoning that approves of the killing of innocent citizens including people who are praying laborers and lowincome workers and employees as a consequence of american attacks
and if there is no answer then you have a dire need to correct your point of view
at the time when people were given arms it was feared that russia after afghanistan would turn its attention to pakistan therefore people were provided the arms
now that we suspect america to attack pakistan from afghanistan which the present american president has spoken about during his presidential campaign why then should we disarm these people
so that america or india after subduing the pakistani armed forces do not have to face any kind of resistance from the people
however if anyone is involved in oppressive activities pakistan should take an action against them only
regretfully the governments seizing of lashkaretayaba has proven india right about pakistan being involved in this affair
najeeburrehman saiko lahore pakistan
even if it is accepted that lashkaretayaba is involved it is not right to blame pakistans government
and another question is did these terrorists not have the support of some government or nongovernment officer in india
are terrorists born or trained only in pakistan and not in india or any other countries of the world
as far as lashkaretayaba is concerned it has got nothing to do with the recent acts of terrorism
a point to remember is that it was hafiz saeed who was the first jihadi leader to label the acts of the taliban as chaos
i am completely sure that the talibans invasion is a part of american plans therefore it is necessary to remove every person and group from the way who should challenge the taliban in any way
to bring an end to this campaign which was started by the saudi and american funding a request should be made of them for gods sake to clean up this mess which has poisoned our society
a protest should also be lodge with them as under what guise did america and saudi arabia spread the virus of dangerous weapons in our country and socalled jihadis and truly hateful literature and culture which opened human slaughterhouses in our country
america was badly rattled when the pakistani army declared after fear of an indian attack that it would move its forces from the afghan border and pay attention to india and the taliban announced that they would take care of the afghan border america used all means available to stop an indian attack on pakistan
and this exposed americas reputation in this area
although india neither threatened to attack nor does it have the guts to do so
the rest has been taken care of by the talibans attacks on american supplies
it proves that without the support of the pakistani army and the pakistani government america is nothing
karachi pakistans trade and finance hub is like the dubai of all undeveloped areas
millions do not leave this place emptyhanded but ever since the western border areas have become lawless karachi has become the focus of everyones attention
now they are on the verge of taking this city hostage
for the first time pathans are being referred to as pakhtuns and inhabitants of the same city are being considered outsiders to make them fight each other although the need is for unity
one solution to the problem is that either the urduspeaking people should learn pashto or the pashtospeaking people should learn urdu or everyone learns english that would be even better
you would definitely find this suggestion amusing but dont you find the reason of the clash amusing
that the reason for violence is language
zaheer chughtai
actually sir i gave this suggestion many times as a child to my friends who belonged to different religious and linguistic groups but they used to laugh it off
in those days these linguistic and religious differences were not as strong and active as they are now they were just percolating beneath the surface
it is hard to understand what is happening and why it is happening
are these the signs of the day of judgment
for what reason are the innocent and blameless people being killed
the reasons are obvious those who want to break up pakistan are the ones who are emotional and they do not belong to any religion or country
be it karachi or mumbai the home has been set on fire by its own inhabitants
whichever government comes in it tries to make a name for itself simply by changing the names of places like these days airports roads buildings everything is being named after benazir
does the name benazir represent whatever is happening to the people of karachi and pakistan
at the peak of the mumbai attacks the failure of raw that instigated riots based on linguistic differences in karachi is proof that the political elements that used to work on raws payroll in the past have resigned from their job
the unwarranted killings of the pashtospeaking laborers and indias threats have awakened pakistani nationalism from karachi to khyber
while this strong display of patriotism from all the political religious linguistic and national parties has taught a diplomatic lesson to india it has also given the american policy makers another opportunity to think
muttahida and anp are responsible for the deterioration of the situation of karachi and the administration is being biased
the administration can control the situation in an hour but it is consciously adding fuel to the fire
police and rangers avoid taking any action due to the pressure of the political parties
the talk of unity is only limited to talk political parties should forget about their political gains and work for the betterment of the common man
as long as the administration has political pressure on it these type of incidences will keep taking place may allah protect pakistan
i think the people themselves are the greatest terrorists
and there are surely some foreign forces involved in this but we dont know who they are
sadly had this situation taken place in some city of the frontier province the government would have laid it to waste but since it is not in the northwest province the government appears to be helpless
the government should carry out an operation here and save a big and important city from terrorism
otherwise pakistan will face a major financial crisis
even bbc urdu is not telling the truth due to fear while pakistani media is even worse
the whole truth is available on bbc english
one solution to the problem is that the urduspeaking people should learn pashto or the pashtospeaking should learn urdu or it would be even better if both learn english
you would definitely find this suggestion amusing but dont you find the reason for this conflict amusing
should the reason behind violence be language
finally in karachi another tale of brutality registered the fear that every citizen had been feeling for quite some time
everyone did what they felt like without restraint the reports that reached us through the media are just 50 percent of what happened here in four days
stayed awake the last three nights and the fear is still there
those who force people out of the hotels and those who beat up cobblers and peanut vendors
those who robbed on the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of the wrath of allah which they will face eventually
in your opinion what are the reasons for this sudden unrest
(bbc)
considering the heartrendering mumbai carnage we do not need to delve too deeply into the situation to find reasons for this violence in karachi the straight and simple reason is that this violence happened because of some subconscious boiling of blood
it is obvious if someone picks a fight with the father then his son getting out of control at this should not come as a surprise
it was built by liaqat ali khan and many others who sacrificed their lives who were from there to remove mr saikos misconception im writing this verse
we will carry on the tradition of our elders
we gave our lives to create it will give our lives to preserve it
faizan tauseef siddiqui
its very unfortunate that the whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other
mr siddiqui i suggest if in wikipedia
you look up liaqat ali khan you would come to know that he belonged to a respectable family of the kernal area of the punjab province
because of what he did for the muhajirs they consider him their own today
every action has a reaction
it can be tolerated if its limited to ones own self but
ejaz awan
sir before you gather a crowd of purveyors of obscenity overnight let me tell you that the signs of real trouble makers can be seen these days as graffiti and posters on the walls of karachi
we have been suffering from the mischief of both types
mischief makers did not leave pakistan or even the founder of pakistan alone they did not have to face any consequences
on the contrary theyre flourishing at the expense of pakistan
only muslim league (n) was left it also prepared a draft of the eighteenth amendment and handed it over to the peoples party
before this mqm and muslim league (q) had already submitted drafts of the eighteenth amendment in the national assembly and the senate
until now it appears as if these drafts of the eighteenth amendment are a political ruse and no one is sincere about getting this amendment approved
this is why no one has spoken up on the floor of the assembly or senate in support of this amendment nor forced the house to approve this amendment
it seems as if by submitting the drafts of the eighteenth amendment these parties have completed a formality that will allow them to say tomorrow that well we did submit the amendment it was the government speaker who did not take action
mqm the governments ally muslim league (n) the governments ally behind the scenes and muslim league (q) the party that got the seventeenth amendment passed how then can these parties be sincere in getting the seventeenth amendment annulled
this is a way for them to appear to be martyrs
the peoples party is in no hurry to get the seventeenth amendment annulled anyway
why would anyone want to get their own hands cut off
as long as zardari is president the seventeenth amendment is not about to be annulled
this was the majority opinion in one of our surveys and its true as well
if the seventeenth amendment had been annulled zardari would have never become president
now he is even more powerful than president musharraf because he along with being the president is also the chair of the peoples party
as long as he is president the seventeenth amendment will remain in place
to get rid of the seventeenth amendment political parties will first have to get president zardari out of the presidential house
this is something neither mqm nor the other parties wants
most of the elders of my family belong to the working class
when i used to see my paternal and maternal uncles and the rest of them working for daily wages i used to pray in my heart that god would save me from such physically rigorous labor
to get out of this i wrote a letter to the editor of the amroze daily newspaper and asked what i should do after graduation so that i dont have to do hard labor
the editor wrote back that i should become a doctor or an engineer or take suchandsuch subjects
my inclination had always been towards engineering and i had even taken technical drawing in school instead of biology
but at the time of the f sc admissions my older brother forced me to do my f sc in medicine and become a doctor
i studied biology with difficulty for a month but when i couldnt make heads or tails of it i changed the subject and took math instead
it means the dread of physical labor made me an engineer and now i have a better job than most of my peers in the family for which i constantly thank god
i was reminded of this when i was trying to lift a carpet with our two young sons at our old home
i said if this is true then study hard like me and save yourself from having to do hard labor
my son said i am studying and ill keep doing it but i cant do this work
we got the job done as best we could in three hours and returned home
the point is that if a man sets his sights on something whatever his reason is behind that nothing can stop him from getting what he wants
but if you dont even know what you want to do only allah can save you
they say not to say bad things about the dead but what should we do we see nothing but benazirs misdeeds even a year after she died
for the sake of her own interests benazir provided india a list of names of the sikhs who were fighting for their independence whereby on the one hand she crushed their independence movement and on the other she gave india the opportunity to suppress the punjab movement and focus all its attention on kashmir
it was benazir and nawaz sharifs tugofwar for power that set the country many years behind
benazir during her exile continued to make negative statements about kashmir and the atomic program
violating the london agreement she had made with nawaz sharif benazir made a deal with general musharraf
benazir during her time in office freely gave her husband the opportunity to make money and this is why he was called mr ten percent
during benazirs time her brother was murdered and his murderers have still not been punished
despite being a woman herself benazir avoided fighting for womens rights
in the same way benazir thrived as a politician because of her fathers death her widowed husband is now thriving as a politician because of hers
benazir got control of the government twice but she couldnt even file a case against those responsible for her fathers political murder let alone get them punished
it has been 37 years since east pakistan separated from us but look at the insensitivity of our people and our rulers we neither mourned on this day nor lamented our mistakes
what we should have done was to commemorate december 16 as a lesson and come up with the kinds of strategies that could prevent such a misfortune from recurring
we should have sent goodwill messages to the people of bangladesh on this day and tried to bring them close to us again
rulers should have opened the hamoodurrehman commissions file and deliberated on the reasons for east pakistans separation
they should have come up with a strategy for bringing back the biharis stuck in bangladesh and sent them gifts to encourage them
but we have become insensitive if someone dies in our neighborhood we do not even find out about it
we dont care about our sisters and brothers anymore because weve become selfish
even if a great tragedy occurs the next day we get tied up in our daytoday affairs
i wish east and west pakistan could reunite the same way that east and west germany did
we can be one again if both make sacrifices for each other and break out of the shell of selfishness
but it doesnt look like this wish will be fulfilled anytime in the near future
today when it was stated in the news that the governor of the american state of illinois was arrested on charges of corruption
and that to take him out of office the provincial congress has started to make preparations to call him to account as soon as possible one of our white american friends who keeps a close watch on the situation in pakistan challenged us as he boasted see this is what democracy is
not even the most important person in america is above the law
and then we have your country pakistan where even the president came into office only after getting the corruption charges dropped
i took it with a sense of humor and said so what if one governor was arrested in america in our pakistan the prime minister was arrested and hanged overnight one time and another one was sent into exile
tell me did this ever happen in america
pakistan gave a guard of honor to a president who broke the national law as he left his house tell me did this ever happen in america
in pakistan the chief justice was suspended in such a way that despite having popular support he still has not been reinstated did this ever happen in america
the holder of a counterfeit degree was made the minister of health in pakistan did this ever happen in america
when he heard this the poor american laughed hysterically as he accepted his defeat
in this photograph president zardari is smiling even though he is surrounded on all four sides by americans
he is smiling as if
he thinks that america is in favor of his government but he is forgetting that a year ago the same people were in favor of pervez musharraf
this photograph has been taken just like a family picture
before this such a photograph with one president and six american officials was never allowed to be published
it seems as if americas work in pakistan has increased so much that not just one official can take care of it they have to team up either that or they dont trust their new slave the way they trusted the one before him
it could also be that this arrangement was made while keeping in mind president zardaris notoriety for going back on his promises
had it been some sensible ruler at least he would not have sported such a smile in the photograph at least there would have been some shame on his face because of the collar of slavery hes wearing
if the principle of democracy is applied to this photograph president zardari is in the minority
in a democracy only a majority rules the country and this photograph shows who the majority is
the heavenly swat is also called the switzerland of pakistan
until now according to government strategy negotiations are being held along with the use of power
but the use of force is having no benefit other than to increase the strength of the taliban and create sympathy for them among the people
there is a need for the government to eliminate the reasons for this problem instead of using force
by eliminating the reasons fazlullah and the taliban will fall apart on their own
the sharia bill proposed by the anp government will go a long way to help solve the problems of swat
but along with enforcing sharia the government will also need to focus on the economic problems
from the initial steps taken by general musharraf it looked like the nation might be rid of incompetent politicians but the lust for power changed all his plans
and the expected steps he would take were disappointed
just like when bushs term in office was coming to an end he started worrying about the end of his power and in the confusion made a deal with thieves
general musharraf could still control the army but the current government does not even know what is happening
in spite of army operations underway for over a year in the frontier provinces insurgencyridden area of swat the situation has been going from bad to worse
on the one hand the governments writ in this area has been reduced to approving condemnatory resolutions in the national assembly on the other talibans illegal fm radio channels influence seems to be increasing in swat
thirdly the common citizen thinks the only way to be safe is to listen to whoever has the power in the area
during the operations in swat carried out by security forces it is claimed that gunship helicopters and bombings of arsenals killed many extremists but in spite of these killings not only has the taliban grown stronger according to one estimate their control has been established in 80 percent of swat
in conclusion the government is not ready to accept its failure and the taliban is stronger
the ones who got stuck in the middle were the poor citizens
it is said that someone in swat asked what kind of people taliban members are the answer came that they are very good people because they are protectors of religion and they fight against the enemies of allah and religion
when asked what the army is like the answer came that its very good because it protects our homeland and fights against the countrys enemies
then when asked who the enemies of religion and our homeland are the answer came we the citizens
i dont know how the pakistani army will fight against the indian army when it could not control a small taliban group
they could not track the talibans illegal fm channel which i think should be very easy to do
even now this fm is spewing its venom with full force
after the girls schools now the boys schools are being destroyed
a curfew is imposed to make it easy for the taliban to move
tonight during the curfew eight trucks entered the outskirts of mingora during the curfew and made trenches
the question that arises is how they managed to get there in spite of the curfew
the army can kill akbar bugti in his house but it salutes the taliban
for allahs sake somebody make this army understand that they should get the helpless people of swat out of the talibans grip and prove that the pakistani army can overpower any enemy
the gentleman says most of the blood in the world has been spilled on the basis of religions tell me now would there be all this killing if there were no religion
punjabi pathan white and black mehsood and other tribes are they all the results of religion
no absolutely not sir religion is what teaches us that there is no black or white no punjabi or muhajir if there were no religion half the world would have been destroyed in the battle between blacks and whites and the rest in the animosity between races
actually it is religion that gives humans moral training and restraints humans did not come here on their own the creator of the universe sent them here and they must live according to his command
as a muslim i am sure that islam is a complete way of life and the true religion
after moving to london for several years i called each of my relatives first thing in the morning to ask how they were doing although most of them had never even called me once to ask how i was doing then i realized that they do not even like me calling them i stopped calling them
i have felt the same living here in france for two years
i dont know why but people expect me to be the one to make the phone call
a resolution about iraq passed in a few hours sending peace troops to darfur is not a problem at all
immediate condemnation of the mumbai attacks and a sanction on suspected organizations is in a matter of a few hours
and we are deliberating about the places where death is rampant
hey you architects of world peace lives are ending here
are you perhaps just waiting for it to end
so that no oppressed person can even think of using a weapon of mass destruction like a slingshot to get his rights
when a father is fleeing with the corpse of his dear son in his hands does no part of your heart ache even then
if not then you dont deserve to be called human
youre a black stain on the name of humanity
so it is proven that this area was the homeland of the israelis too for thousands of years
ideally both nations should live together in peace but since their strings are in the hands of the west and the arab countries there can never be peace here without their approval
even iran now wants to fight its proxy war from here
even if the israeli operation stops for the time being it will start up again after some other incident
the interests of bbcs country lie with favoring america and israel and this is the reason why it has come out with a series of blogs on zionism in the guise of openmindedness and is making blind and onesided propaganda
bbc is merely fulfilling a formality and its only aim is to gather sympathies
the moderator is requested to publish the comment of this humble applicant so that we can get an idea whether bbc still has any semblance of realism its material
thanks
whoever wrote this story or however it came into existence it is true that every age has had a dracula who drinks innocent human blood
every age has seen wars and every age has seen bloodshed
the strange thing is how this person who thinks himself a very cultured person of the twentyfirst century is silent over this massacre in broad daylight
how he cannot feel that what is happening is showing the worst possible face of humanity
best regards sajjad ulhasnain hyderabad deccan
right now along with dera ghazi khan the whole country is receiving winter rains
heres a poem that goes along with the weather along with this poem enjoy the rain
even these rains are like you
when they fall there is spring
when they pause there is rest
at times coming without a reason
at times engulfing day with night
at times there is noise at times silence
even these rains are like you
in someones thoughts some night
buried ash
once extinguished
which again ignited itself
at times there is grief in every drop
even these rains are like you
all these rulers are about to run away with briefcase in hand they couldnt care less whether the country survives or not
whether the people sell toothpaste or clean the bells of a temple with the skin of a lemon
for one thing our media is as corrupt as our rulers
its only aim is to amass wealth from the government nothing else
as far as the people are concerned they remain ignorant and talking about them would be even more ignorant
a strange thing happened yesterday afternoon
all the police running around but no one asks about the illegal parking
or even looks at the cars illegal parking in nypd traffic is another story
it just so happened that a usair vessel really became a vessel and landed in the hudson river
all the goose knows at this point is that the terrorists are related to the birds
yesterday was perhaps the coldest day in new york history
it doesnt usually go that low
my own jaw started to hurt after a halfhour walk outside
you can imagine how the people must have felt who jumped from the plane into the river
the good news is that all the people were safe
and the bad news is that the companys plane drowned in this financial crisis
watching this i went to new jersey via the west side highway even when i saw that the southbound lane was closed so what did i do
yes i got stuck in traffic on my return
thankfully during my onehour trip the way opened up to some extent so i found the 56 street exit
seeing the lines across the first two exits i had not taken them
miki my pakistan congratulations to you too happy eid
ammar of course faithful ones

sara i did two chickens we do sacrifice and jahanzeb has explained the way we do it

we were considering the swati taliban group to be uncultured just because they were complaining about the education of women
every day somewhere or other they were expressing their anger by demolishing schools and colleges for women
but like most opinions this one also proved to be incorrect according to cnn today on the blessed day of monday a taliban group blew up a boys school
swat taliban demolish boys school
in reality the girls schools had only been demolished first based upon the famous english saying ladies first who knows why people are still determined to call the taliban uncultured devoid of culture savage
it is also made clear by this that the accusation leveled against the taliban that theyre only against the education of girls is wrong
allah save them they are against education itself
may allah the holy grant these holy warriors more strength
and help them uproot the corrupt government that has been set over us
this brought to mind the recent marriage of a girl to a dog
look at that bridegroom too
humanity is scarce even in the twentyfirst century
this is the age of computers and the interference of computers in every part of life is increasing
many people have reservations about this growing interference of computers in things such as financial matters
while it makes the use of credit cards easy it is also easier for law enforcement agencies to keep track of your personal life
now you can be traced through financial transactions such as the record of your use of a credit card
and in the future when the use of real money becomes extremely rare it will be even more useful
in the crime world too instead of taking the risk of robbing a bank the information from a credit card is hacked
similarly now there are even ways of making friends through computers
social networking websites like orkut facebook and myspace rank highest in terms of popularity
but dont you think that the more we comply with these social networking sites the more we are getting distanced from people on a practical level
there are even matchmaking websites where your preferences are matched with the preferences of other people and the list of those compatible with you is provided
now can you spend your life with another person who is just like you
i cannot the reason why a life partner is also called the better half
is that they make up for my flaws
i may have gotten the lesser share of wisdom
since childhood whatever my elders said was the truth to me
for example i was sure that my father knew the answers to all the questions in the world
i was even made fun of because of this
however something seemed true to me only if it could be possible
it was very perplexing why there was a need to lie
i even suffered at that age for this reason
therefore i try to lie as little as possible
i try not to give anyone false hopes especially in the name of allah
and i only say allah willing when praying to allah that he fulfill some request
allah knows best what my intentions are
this is a nauseating problem which has arisen because of estrangement from religion
according to both our religion and the law of pakistan young children should stay with their mother
it is the fathers duty to take care of their expenses and he is allowed to meet with the children
then when the children grow up they can live with whomever they want
you have rightly pointed out that relatives are the real problem because they give the wrong advice
the feudal mindset dictates all our actions
the same mindset is at work here that our father will have more children to claim their share in his property so he must be stopped if it werent for this their fathers act would be praised and emulated
it is these hangups about marriage that have created the evils in our society
the concept of a marriage for a divorced or widowed woman is becoming extinct
because of these useless beliefs and misplaced traditions the family system is breaking down
why does our society frown upon the remarriage of a 50 or 55yearold husband or wife who has lost his or her spouse
we have a pakistani uncle close to us his wife died ten or twelve years ago when he married a widow after getting all his children married they all turned against him
in my view this is a right that has been granted to him by the sharia what do you think
what kind of an attitude do we have that makes us say that we cant tolerate anyone taking our mothers place
i think this mans children should consider that if he married a widow after getting all of them married what did he do wrong
this way the widow got support and the uncle also got someone to take care of him
because his children must have gotten tied up in their own worlds giving him no time
the reason behind this is ignorance
this is a result of societal pressure
when people ridicule a family for such a thing children start to feel embarrassed because of their fathers remarriage
when they should face up to the situation and say that what their father did was completely in accordance with islam
this is a curse in our society which we have been suffering from for the last 4050 years
a wife even accepts it if her husband goes around having extramarital relations but she does not allow him to marry a second time
if she could she wouldnt even let him do it after her death
on top of ruining things for her husband she ruins them for herself in the afterlife as well and also gives cause to the spread of filth in society
its no use talking about islam in reality we only like what goes along with our traditions and customs
for instance trading girls for marriage killing girls for accusations of adultery depriving girls of an education and shooting them for marrying of their own choice
as far as your question is concerned instead of bringing the widow to his own home if the man had gone to the widows home his heirs would have settled down and been satisfied after making some fuss about it (although the widows heirs would then become jealous)
although we accepted islam in the indian subcontinent centuries ago to this day we have not been able to get rid of this ignorant mindset and still prefer tradition and custom over islam
a mans second marriage is obscene divorce is a blot that cannot be hidden a divorced woman is untouchable marriage by choice ruins reputations and a mans marriage with a older woman is seen as a result of the womans trickery all these attitudes reflect the same mindset
and to copy the western nations we call abstinence and using the veil an outdated thing
accepting islam was easy getting rid of this mindset is very difficult
may allah give us all the strength and courage for this
amen
writing urdu was never this hard
centuries have passed since ive written so much
consider this little bit enough
may allah protect you
but here the situation is totally different
they say the common people are here to die for us if we die were martyrs
if a common person dies its just a casualty
peace mercy and blessing be upon you
tonight when i was coming back to the shop after prayers a man sitting in a car raised his hand to call my attention
i thought maybe hes lost or wants to ask me something i stopped and saw that his whole family was sitting in the car
he asked me if i could understand arabic well or not i said no problem tell me whats the matter
he said i have come here to madina from riyaz but someone has pick pocketed me please help me i said sorry brother ive fallen for this trick before i gave a guy twenty riyals to fill up with petrol to go to riyaz but he just went a little way down the road and started telling people the same story
i got really angry and tried to scare him off saying id call a cop so he took off
the situation has become such that we muslims take our family with us on a car to beg and make at least two to three thousand a day
whereas there is a clear tradition (may allah bless him and give him peace) that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand because the upper hand gives while the lower one takes
(may the most high allah be kind to us and make us true muslims amen)
peace to you
distinguished singer adnan samis wife went to a police station in mumbai accusing him of beating her
the police have advised her to go to court
adnan samis wife sabah guladari filed a petition against her husband that he constantly beats her
treats her inhumanely
and now this has become unbearable for her so a case should be filed against adnan sami
the police advised her to go to the court instead of filing a case saying that they could not get involved in the matter
in your opinion is adnan samis wifes accusation against him true
could this accusation be an attempt by india to ruin adnan samis reputation
tell us what you think about this
adam sanghar mehr
as far as accusations are concerned anyone can make them against someone
theres nothing more important than respectability
whatever the relations are between adnan sami and his present wife adnan sami left a respectable life and went to india to earn money now this popularity has become a liability to him
this is a consequence of his own actions
senior american officials say that president obama will maintain a tough stand regarding afghan president hamid karzai
in americas new strategy for afghanistan war has been given more importance than development
officials say that hamid karzai is being considered a hindrance in the achievement of american objectives in afghanistan because there is corruption in the government the drug business has increased and taliban forces are reforming
american officials say that in the american administration the ones who are pressurizing hamid karzai to do more include vice president joe biden and richard holbrooke president obamas representative for afghanistan and pakistan
they said that this strategy has emerged after the departure of president bush who used to have a video conference with hamid karzai every two weeks and emphasize the american role in the reconstruction of afghanistan and its urban organizations
officials say that the obama administration will work with provincial leaders as an alternative to the central government
officials say that they will urge hamid karzai to continue the war against corruption
hamid karzai will face new elections this year and it is not yet clear whether or not obama and his associates will support him for the presidency
is this statement by the american officials a prelude to a change in american policy
is hamid karzais time coming to an end
what is your opinion about this
malik babar hussain jeddah it is very sad that even in modern times such traditions of ignorance are still in place landowners and others with power and prestige use their tyrannical authority to target innocent people who would call them muslim
some day one of these men with power should walk on these coals himself why doesnt the present government do anything against them
when will there be justice from the courts

a foreign cricket team coming to pakistan in spite of the tension between pakistan and india is a promising sign
sri lankas team was warmly welcomed on its arrival at the karachi airport

all this has been done by these people kashmiris have been fighting for freedom for the last sixty years
no no one asked them now that they are stuck in the war against extremism and terrorism peace talks have been started
first they massacred muslims and now they want to resolve issues
anyway pakistan will have to understand the double standards in their policy
asad khan london
india is creating a kind of situation to divert the worlds attention from kashmir
but pakistan has always shown the world the true face of india
now the british government also understands this which is why on the basis of the terrorism in india it is defaming pakistan and ignoring the occupancy of kashmir
and is hesitating in talking to pakistan about this problem
british foreign secretary david miliband has said that solving the kashmir issue would end extremism and enable the government of pakistan to take care of the threats emerging in the frontier province effectively
before this american presidentelect obama had already expressed similar thoughts on the kashmir issue
the british foreign secretary in his talk with the media in mumbai and in one of his essays has said that the idea of a war on terror is wrong justifying the murder of people on the basis of the threats that faced him was the policy of president bush
david miliband has said that pakistan should not show any leniency to extremist groups
due to the emphasis the superpowers have placed on the need to resolve the kashmir conflict could india be trying to divert attention from this problem by creating tension in the region
could the terrorism in mumbai be a part of this strategy
does india want to avoid inclusive negotiations using terrorism as an excuse
tell us what you think
usman aftab
i dont think the superpowers want to cause permanent harm to pakistan
rather they are thinking of ways to control it they know that pakistan is an atomic power
they want to create some kind of revolution here
foreign countries are just thinking that cornering pakistan could create difficulties politically and geographically they want both to help pakistan and to achieve their own aims too
a citizen usa
hindus have always had the tradition of appearing calm on the surface but carrying grudges on the inside
i think they get a stomachache every now and then and start threatening pakistan

prime minister syed yousaf raza gilani has said that the american vice presidentelect joe biden played an important role in making expresident musharraf step down from office and in bringing back the sham of democracy which is why the government of pakistan awarded him the sitaraeimtiaz
no political party should get the credit for making someone step down from office or the restoration of democracy parliament is not a rubber stamp
all decisions are made in parliament
the prime minister said that dr qadeers chapter has been closed
in your opinion were the protests by the people against dictatorship of no importance

american president george w bush said in his final press conference that he made a lot of mistakes during his term as president and advised presidentelect barack obama to do what he feels is right
as president i acted in keeping with circumstances and the american constitution and law and i gave preference to american interests over my own popularity
he said the enemies of america are still planning to attack america and the greatest challenge for barack obama will be to stop them
he said my greatest disappointment is not having found the weapons of mass destruction from iraq and my biggest mistake was to accept that the mission in iraq was completed
speaking at his last press conference at the white house the american president said this is my last press conference and i thank all the journalists and other friends who have come to the conference
do you think obama will not repeat the mistakes made by bush
didnt bush take too long to admit to his mistakes
will obama be able to act upon bushs advice

the indian prime minister manmohan singh has once again accused pakistan of stirring up an atmosphere of war
and using terrorism as a state policy
speaking at the conference of chief ministers in new delhi manmohan singh said that terrorist elements are supported by neighboring countries especially pakistan
and the terrorists behind the mumbai attacks used the sea route while avoiding the indian coast guard
the indian prime minister said that lashkaretayaba carried out the mumbai attacks in november
he added terrorists are using new techniques and the most modern communication systems we will have to heighten security on the line of control as well from which intrusions are made he said terrorism will not be tolerated under any conditions this is our policy
how do you see this accusation by the indian prime minister
are internal turmoil and separatist movements in india reflective of the indian anxiety
on whose instructions has india assumed such threatening conduct
tell us what you think
zubair khan karachi
it is a great tragedy that israelis are massacring palestinians here the situation in kashmir is the same but the security council is not bothered in the least
whatever organizations are present in palestine and kashmir should continue their struggle until they are free and creating unity amongst themselves continue to fight against any type of aggression one day allah willing their martyrdom will produce results
israels air raids on gaza continue as usual by now hundreds of palestinian men women and children have been killed
nizar rayyan an important hamas political leader has been martyred along with his wife and children
meanwhile the meeting of the security council has ended without reaching a decision
in the meeting the condemnatory resolution presented by libya and other arab countries faces american opposition
israels aerial bombing of palestines civilian population has continued for the past few days
the whole world raised a fuss over the mumbai events but why cant anyone including america and britain see the massacre taking place under the israeli attacks
why are the important countries of the muslim ummah silent
what do you have to say about the worlds double standard

i think the point is that most of our nation is illiterate they dont even know where their money is going the government has an interest to fulfill its responsibilities by levying taxes the electricity and gas crisis will remain the same
because everyone knows the character of those whom the people elected
the electricity and gas crisis has reached a critical point all over pakistan
on the other hand since january 1 gas rates have been increased by eight percent on the average while the unavailability of petrol is a cause of serious concern for people in various cities of the country
extreme reactions emergencies and violent demonstrations are afoot amongst pakistani industrial and business circles because of the long blackouts and the gas crisis
industrialists have given an ultimatum for shutting down factories
here in karachi anxiety can be seen amongst the citizens because of the eight to ten hours of loadshedding
industrial activity has almost been paralyzed
governmental institutions are stating their position by hurling accusations at each other about the issue
isnt the talk of increasing the price of electricity and gas a joke to the nation
why isnt attention being given to solving the problems
cant the government see national progress coming to a standstill
what immediate steps would you recommend to overcome this crisis
tell us what you think
imran khokhar madina munawwara i want to say that the rulers are just like the people

benazir is not with us anymore she was a statesman a politician and a worldfamous persona she had a unique position in national politics

president bush after ruling america for eight years left the white house for the presidential office at camp david so that the white house could be redecorated according to preferences of presidentelect barack obama
during bushs eight years as president the historical attack and destruction of the world trade center the attack on the pentagon then under the pretense of a global war against terror americas dragging of the armies of other countries into its military operations in afghanistan and iraq and the full use of its resources in this war became the memorabilia of bushs term

were the policies of president bush successful
what is your opinion about president bushs term of office
the indian government has refused to allow the indian cricket team to tour pakistan
during the pakistan tour the indian cricket team was to play three tests five oneday matches and one 2020 match
when speaking with geo news indian cricket boards vicepresident rajeev shukla said that they had sought permission for the pakistan tour from the government but due to the current tension between the two countries the tour will not be possible
is the indian governments justification for canceling the indian cricket teams tour on the basis of the current political situation a right step shouldnt sports be kept separate from politics
is the indian governments decision harmful for cricket
if the english cricket team has continued its tour of india despite the decline in the security situation why cant the indian team tour pakistan
what is your opinion on this
salman karachi
those who take pride in going to india
or get their movies or videos made there should open their eyes and see how little the indian people respect them
i remember an interview with adnan sami in which he said that he was not a pakistani but a british citizen
adnan sami should come to pakistan at the earliest opportunity if the fame he got in india wasnt to his tastes
fareed ahmed
karachi
the indians behavior has changed after the mumbai attack
jagjit singh has reacted to it by saying that he hates pakistan and pakistanis
it should be known that adnan sami has sung with asha bhosle how did he become tonedeaf now adnan sami should stay in india theres no need for him to come here
muhammad shamshad alam
karachi about jagjit singhs statement i would only say that he changes his color just like a chameleon
changing his statement according to the situation pakistanis open your eyes and see how little you are appreciated in india understand the mentality of the hindus
their malicious battle of words has increased after the mumbai incident and now theyre saying venomous things about the famous singer adnan sami
after this the journalist took off one of his shoes and threw it at bush president bush dexterously saved himself by ducking his head before the shoe hit him
the second shoe hit the american flag
security workers dragged the journalist off the scene
on the occasion president bush said i dont know why he did this the shoe was a size ten i wasnt upset
dont you think this act of the journalist was an expression of the anger that the iraqi people have for president bush
what would you say about this incident
the tension that had been created in relations between pakistan and india after the incidents of terrorism in mumbai took a serious turn when warplanes of the indian air force violated pakistani air space in the lahore and kashmir sectors
the indian planes were forced to return because of the response by the pakistan air force
according to sources both of the indian planes were equipped with arms and ammunition
this is the first incident of its kind in the current tense situation
the pakistan air force says that the air force is fully prepared to defend the country
information minister sherry rehman says that indian officials have accepted that the air space was violated but that it was by mistake
pakistan military sources have declared this a serious incident
do you think india in reality intends to undertake an air raid on pakistan
is the indian stance of having violated the air space by mistake correct or was its aim to gauge the capability of the pakistan air force
will this incident become a reason for an increase of tension in the relations between these countries

in a ceremony held during the meeting of the general assembly in united nations headquarters the martyred benazir bhutto once pakistans prime minister was given the award as a recognition of her services to the cause of human rights
the sixtieth anniversary of their resolution for human rights was celebrated by the united nations on the tenth of december
in addition to benazir bhutto those persons and organizations that have been given awards on the occasion to recognize their work for human rights include americas exattorney general louis ramsey clark and the international organization human rights watch which works for human rights worldwide
pakistans representative to the united nations abdullah hussain haroon and other senior pakistani diplomatic officials were also present on the occasion

sumair
chicago
its true that she was martyred but it should also be remembered that she killed so many innocent people in karachi of which she used to say proudly that naseerullah babar has done a very good job
but later she completely changed
but its also true that she ignored senior members of her party and chose her son to be the representative of the peoples party what kind of democracy is this
jimmy noor karachi from this news what the quran says has been proven true that an infidel will only support an infidel
but until an iron axe is given a handle the axe cannot cut a wing
these are the ways of our rulers they are keeping their ways secret and for this reason the country is facing disasters
may allah guide our rulers
the united nations security councils panel has added to its list of terrorists the names of hafiz muhammad saeed along with three other pakistani citizens and the name of jamiatuddaawa along with five other organizations

member countries will immediately freeze the assets of all these persons and organizations they will not be allowed to travel and they will be arrested
they will be faced with court cases
are these restrictions under the influence of indian propaganda
why is india accusing these organizations of the mumbai attacks without any proof
are there no terrorist organizations in india
are global organizations not aware of the oppression being done in india against the minorities
