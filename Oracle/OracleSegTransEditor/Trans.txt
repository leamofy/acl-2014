the european unions role in peace in the middle east
officially the european union plays a decisive role in the mediatory efforts taken for stopping the war in middle east
according to the official stand of brussels schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of sarkozy are helping hands in this process
the spokesperson of the european commission amadeu altafaj said that every effort which helps advancing the joint message of the european union to the two parties is welcome
everything seems fine as far as the official statement is concerned
however in reality the european union is in a sad state of internal conflict
the role of czech republic as the president of the union is already weak
also the internal issues have made it helpless
on the other hand the french president sarkozy is behaving as if he is still the president of the european union
though france has completed its six month presidency period
sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do so
the most funny situation is faced by the french foreign minister bernard kouchner
he is in the delegation which is led by schwarzenberg the foreign minister of czech republic
even worse both the foreign ministers are giving different statements on the middle east war
schwarzenberg says that israel has the right to defend herself while according to kouchner war is not the answer germany has also sent a special ambassador to the middle east as long as european union does not show a unanimous stand she can not be successful on the diplomatic front
its evidence is the reaction of israel which does not give any importance to the conciliation efforts of the eu
this is a golden chance for the european union to do something since america due to the policies of george w bush has already failed in the middle east
financial crisis german industrialist billionaire commites suicide
adolf marclay resident of swabia in south germany has left behind a huge industrialist group
but earlier common german citizens did not know much about him
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the merckle group
the merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million euros due to financial crisis after it bought shares in the german car manufacturing company volkswagen
then the financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed 100 million and 1 billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on marclay
recently the same banks accepted to provide loan to marclay group on urgent basis but adolf marclay who started as a small industrialist to reach a place where his industrial groups annual income reached 30 billion euros couldnt bear the the loss in his financial strength
after the death of his father when adolf merkel took over his family business he developed it quickly putting it on a new track
he called his company ratiopharm which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in germany
until a while ago the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion euros and it still earns about 81 billion euros a year after the superb success of ratiopharm the merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like hydelburg cement and car manufacturing companies like kassbohrer
the number of employees of the merkel group around the world is near 100000 and its foundation company the pharmaceutical ratiopharm always had special importance
adolf marclay has said this many times in his life we have been in pharma business since four generations
now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and i hope that the management of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years
after the suicide of adolf merkel banks have approved 400 million euros in floating loans for his group but under the condition that vem will have to sell ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term
after the death of adolf marclay the marclay group will not remain the same as it was before
crime rate of foreigners living in germany
according to joachim herrmann the interior minister of baweria province this is apparently a positive change
he said it is important to note that the number of foreigners getting german citizenship is increasing

senator christoph ahlhaus of interior ministry from cdu said when the scientific research is conducted one can not draw results of his own rather they depend on the data which is calculated after research
ahlhaus presented an analysis report of provincial office of crime management prepared in 2006 according to which in the bergdorf area of hemberg the percentage of foreigners in the crimes committed there was calculated
results indicate that here foreigners
crime rate is less then the crimes committed in the whole province
on the contrary during 2006 when youth crime rate in berlin was observed revealed that the youth having the foreign background was 44
7 percent
however the various german political parties such as spd environmentalist party grains and left wing party linkspartei are against the collecting of crime statistics of german citizens with a foreign background

according to the officials american jet fired three missiles near a house in the area mir ali of north waziristan killing 10 people in that house
according to local officials five of those who were killed were foreign soldiers
this area is considered the center of the taliban and alquaeda activity
a few hours after this incident a missile attack was performed on south waziristan as well in which at least eight people died
despite the objections of the pakistani government about 30 missile attacks occurred in pakistan since the middle of last year
the present attacks were the first since president barack obama took office
the bush administration had refused to acknowledge responsibility for such attacks
on friday suspected american spy planes dropped three missiles in the tribal region of north waziristan until now five people have died
the dead victims have not been identified
according to the initial reports the missile attacked a house in mir ali
it should be considered that this was the first attack after barack obama became president
sarhad government rejected the question of ban on girls education
province sarhad rejected the threat of taliban soldiers in swat by saying that this announcement is against the law and islam
on sunday the education minister of sarhad state sardar husain babar added that the government will never allow such efforts to succeed
he said that the extremists are attempting to deprive our regions children of education
in his words these people try to secretly blow up schools and frighten the boys and girls
talking about the environment of fear and insecurity he said that the local government knows well and wants it to be known that no force can stop the spread of education in the land of the pukhtons
one day before maulana fazaullah taliban revolts from 15th january in south put a ban on girls education in institutions and the institutions which go against the warning will be destroyed
despite the military activity going on in swat during the last one and a half years about 150 educational institutions were destroyed by the militants by the use of explosives and arson
due to the destruction of these educational institutions thousands of girls and boys were deprived of an education

tea an effective cure for breast cancer
new research shows that drinking three cups of tea day
reduces the danger of breast cancer in women under 50 years of age by 13rd
research at the moffitt cancer center in the american state of florida has showed that chances of getting chest cancer in those women under 50 years of age
the research study also claims that it does not help older women even if they drink three or more cups of tea daily
specialists think that this is because of the presence of such components in tea that are more effective against the types of cancer tumors which usually target women under 50 years of age
in the moffitt cancer center in tampa florida research was conducted on over 5000 women who had undergone treatment for breast cancer
experts compared their medical records and lifestyles with women who were safe from breast cancer
the experts also found out that on a particular type of cancer lobular tea had shown a great effect and it reduced by 66 percent
almost every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type of it
this type of cancer is more dangerous because it is deep inside and is usually diagnosed when it has already spread to a great extent
experts say that by drinking at least three cups of tea a day the danger of breast cancer can be reduced in young women
they say that incorporating tea as a regular drink in your daily routine helps create immunity against the cancer
in britain every year almost 40000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer

american secretary of defense robert gates has said that the war in afghanistan is the biggest military challenge for america
today gates was briefing the senate and the house of representatives of the strategy adopted by the obama administration on the afghan and iraq war
gates told the armed services senate committee that war is not the only solution to afghan problems he also said that in order to make many areas secure army personnel will not be available the taliban are taking advantage of this
why reduce exercise with age
new research
exercise is good for health at any age
it makes your heart stronger reduces cholesterol levels helps control weight helps in limiting diabetes and slows the alzheimers process
unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age
experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active however age can affect it
the american medical association says that many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out
dr patricia palecca of mayo clinic minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to exercise and lack of bodily activity
dr patricia teaches medicine at the mayo clinic
she headed a research regarding heart diseases and mans ability to do exercise in older age
a team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of the heart
in which the pumping of the blood by the heart its contraction and relaxation was studied
the experts focused on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood
they came to know that with increase in age problems increase in the relaxation action of heart
dr patricia says with an increase in age problems occur in the relaxation of heart and this effects the ability to exercise
dr garvin ken was part of this research
he says that they were surprised to see that it has an effect as it confirmed that poor exercising ability is closely related to the hearts relaxation phase
sometimes blood pressure can cause disorders in heart functions and heart disease
if the doctor and patent work together they can achieve the benefits of exercise despite the patients advanced age
a detailed report has been published in the journal of the american medical association
no chances of an immediate war with pakistan indian army chief
the chief of the indian army general deepak kapoor has stated that there are no chances of immediate war with pakistan however to serve the country and protect its interests they are always ready
general kapoor claimed that despite assurances and international pressure following the mumbai attacks the terrorism network is not only present in pakistan but is also active
he said this while talking to correspondents in srinagar
the indian army chief was on a one day tour to the valley of kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in new delhi administered kashmir and preparation of armed forces on the borders
he was asked his thoughts on media reports that pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from india regarding the mumbai attacks
general kapoor said that decisions of war or peace affairs are managed by political leadership
talking about the alleged terrorism network in pakistan he said that indian army will have to face the forces which are objected to destroy peace and weaken india
he said that 700 to 800 militants are present in indian kashmir almost half of them are foreigners
general deepak kapoor said with the betterment of weather attempts of slander may increase from pakistan and her side of kashmir however india has increased vigilance on borders
he refused the chances of reducing the number of deployed army in indian administered kashmir by saying that no compromise on country security
may allah bless the tongues of the world and may barack become a blessing for the world
well there is no hope but see what pakistanamerica relationship brings to us in the result of this change
and what barack obama who is the result of martin luther kings dreams gives to the world
obama part of whose name is husain taking the oath today as the american president is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance but also a historic test
not only for himself but also for all the people who supported him
this will also be a test for the white majority as it is not easy for them to accept wholeheartedly the presidency of a black man
those here in south asia especially the muslims who have hopes about him should remember that he was elected the president of america and obama should remember that the president of america is actually the president of the world
a man whose brothers and sisters were brought to america as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th president of this very america
many people have many expectations from this man
it is necessary for those who admire him not to have unrealistic expectations for him
if obama becomes successful in decreasing the religious and racial acrimony it will be a victory for his fans
what effect will this change have on south asia and what considerable change can be expected in the american policy in this regard
how will this change affect the relationship between america and pakistan
my sir whether it be obama or someone else the type of policies with regards to the whole world is decided by the multibillionaire influential strong jewish lobby
and as far as pakistan is concerned after the series of recent bombay blasts the offensive reaction of india america and israel is obvious to everyone
after the creation of pakistan the administration of swat remained with the ruler of swat who had a regular army and law
he handed over administration of swat to pakistan under a pact
but its sad that our governments have treated swat like a stepmother
there was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government of the ruler of swat
and no interest was taken in the building and development works
the number of girls receiving education in the present rule is many times less than their number in the previous rule
the taliban continue their attacks on educational institutions in the nwfp
the maximum number of schools have been destroyed in district swat in which majority are the girls schools
not just thatthe taliban have also announced a ban on education for girls
thousands of male and female students are being deprived of education
what do you think the taliban have to gain by eradicating female education
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities so far
in your opinion what government should do
the question should be what does the isi and pakistani agencies get
because the people of swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the taliban and not to kill them otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that during the curfew how come people can be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing
when the government is not being allowed to have any say in swat how can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps
now the question is when government has every thing like armed force latest weapons latest technology and spy system then why these taliban cant be controlled
the only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught
the conclusion is that the taliban through their dark activities are making the work of the global leadership easier
fifteen years ago the war was on in afghanistan
the isi was controlling the taliban while the opposing side the northern coalition was being aided by russia india and iran
then suddenly the situation changed and the talibans works came to light
and isi was also offered dollars from america so past friends became enemies
now the scenario is that the war is still raging but the supporters in pakistan are still the same iran india and russia
until man realizes what is wrong and what is right he continues to make mistakes
for example if a thief who goes to steal gets the thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse with punishment then he fears from god and will not steal
similarly as long as israel does not realize that it is doing wrong and spilling the blood of the innocent it will receive punishment for that and will continue to play with the blood of the innocent people in gaza
greetings
the question is that is war armed resistance and terrorism the solution to problems
if not then what is the specific prescription which takes to the solution of the problems
it is true that war and extremism do not solve problems but adds blessings to them
palestine afghanistan and iraq should adopt the same model for their development that nelson mandela used in south africa
that means political and inner struggle are more important than armed struggle
kashmiris participation in election shows that they have accepted this point
the israeli attacks on gaza still continue in the third week and the death toll have reached to one thousand
despite worldwide diplomatic efforts to date a ceasefire was not possible
according to another report since the start of attacks on the 27th of december 90000 palestinians have left their homes and moved towards safer locations
aid groups have accused israel of being careless about palestinian children saying that a whole generation of palestinian children will be victims of severe psychological and emotional problems
what do you say
how is permanent peace possible in gaza

taliban should be given a chance
basit peshawar
be aware if the taliban started the real jihad then who will slaughter the innocent people
who will burn down girls schools
and if kidnap for ransom or not get ransom so who will hang people on the pole by called them american spy
the taliban has done more damage to islam than any other nation or religio
pashtoon roar
kohat pakistan
if the entire muslim world gets together and even just threatens israel you will see how much israels daddy america will get hurt
and immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well
but what can be done where should our muslim leaders bring the courage from
some one ask ahmadinejad to take the initiative because your bravery is very popular in bbc forum
the responsibility of establishing peace and human rights does not rest with the arabs or the muslims of the world alone but is the obligation of the entire world community to raise their voice against tyranny
this dreadful incident is the worst amongst the crimes committed by bush
as we saw in pakistan and india at the end of the fiscal year on 30th of june the governmental has been pillaged the american administration has given a green signal to israel to do whatever she wants
on one hand america says that efforts will be made for a ceasefire
on the other hand the united nation is passing one resolution over another but both have done practically nothing this means that the united nations is also working to crush the muslims
all the islamic countries should cancel their membership in united nations and lay the foundation of their own international organization
we have many examples of where promises and resolutions of america and the united nations lead only to harm of muslims
what is the use of this probaganda when bbc is not going to publish it
where have all the rules of journalism been buried when blood specifically of muslims is spilled the monster of unbiasedness gets onto bbcs back
it considers itself the standard bearer of truth
pubslishing something from their own sounds far they even dint publish the discussions
the only difference between you and the jews is that they call themselves jews and martyr the muslims while you stay among muslims call yourselves muslims and cause muslims
syja786
long time since in the forums of bbc a specific cult has been targeted sometimes in suicide attacks and sometimes in terrorism happening in india
the favorite word of these antiislamic discussions was extremism
but who is the extremist that you can easily figure out from the above comment
when will our muslims understand that dajjal cannot be fought with the sword
after watching israels bombings on unarmed people what would ones tearfilled heart do
but the basic fault is of this turmoil and massacre which by naming jihad we try to blacken the beautiful face of islam
when majority of the palestinians have accepted the existence of israel what need does hamas have to send rockets into israel or conduct suicide attacks
the conduct of both sides is misanthropist
the role of the un and the usa was again seen as favoring the injustice of israel
may allah allow the muslim nation to unite amen
and the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism after all they are doing the real work
otherwise is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are
in easy words such gangsters are told to do whatever they want
hitting people hard and leave them to cry
the arab rulers are giving medicines for the injured funeral clothings for the dead and money and they are asking
what should be done about israeli attacks
the actual problem is that the rulers of islamic countries including saudi arabia are dreaming undutiful and unaware they have neither the army nor defense plans they just think that by providing aid they have fulfilled their duty
they should immediately take practical steps against israel
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to european countries and america but alas they
greetings to all brothers and sisters
i believe that in this time of difficulty telling hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans and it is similar to considering them defeated
if israel and its supporters are at the height of their pharoahism soon moses will be born within their house as this is the rule of nature the steps taken by america and israel have acted like a fertilizer growing suicide bombers among the muslims
which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing
abu abdullah pakistan
hamas and israel should reconcile so that this bloodshed comes to an end
mohammad sarfraz paris france
rightly said
suppose that hamas is 100 truthful and they are struggling against oppression to become successful in the eyes of allah even then they should know that if a good deed results in the destruction of an established house it is no longer a good deed
those who claim to love god his prophet(pbuh) and their religion to love humanity is part of their belief
as if it is the order of allah to wipe all the people of the book from the face of the earth other than muslims
najeeburrehman psycho lahore pkitn
the order is not to kill them but to invite them to islam
but jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion
these people should be fought against unless they stop these conspiracies this doesnt mean that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering
brothers the fate of the murderer of innocent children is annihilation
but i ask my friends that the israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past have become so strong today that they dont listen to any one this is because the jews are united
there are no sheas and sunnis they are just jews and they have developed everything in every field
in contrast what is the condition of 55 islamic countries
they are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death
it is essential that all muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against israel
feroz magsi jhang pakistan
there is no better strategy than to recognize israel learn modern education and means of progress and let the world live in peace and harmony
muslims have plenty of land and resources
the need is correct usage
the first and most disappointing factor is that hamas and alfateh could not unite
great leaders like yasir arafat and sheikh yasin were killed in an organized manner to weaken this brave nation which is doing jihad for the aqsa mosque this was impossible without getting yasin and arafat out of the way
the world is witnessing how palestine has been scattered after the death of these two leaders
and how the jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip
in 1974 a pakistani prime minister was of such an international trust that first time in history he united all the muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance
today on his 81st birthday is it a very difficult task for the whole nation to promise to keep unity in its lines
by eliminating the differences among muslims it will complete its mission of establishing an islamic commonwealth
this is a jinn which has been inside palestine for half a century
this jin has many mouths
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world
and its other mouths are eating humans in iraq afghanistan iran and pakistan
this monster is most unhappy with islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through islam and the history of practical islam that islam has put giants like abu jehl on the right path
bombing from israeli fighter planes on gaza has continued since 27th of december
more than 300 palestinians have been killed in these attacks
after the arial attacks israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council the united nations has demanded israel and the palestinian authorities to ceasefire
however the israeli authorities say that they will continue their operation in gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on israel have stopped
in your opinion is the statement by israel that this is an israeli struggle for safety acceptable
is the world community playing its role in such situation
does this aggression have any relation to the upcoming elections in israel
can any improvement be expected in the situation in the middle east after the newly elected american president barak obama takes office
(please note that due to an increase in the number of comments only comments typed in urdu will be published
for this press altshift on the onscreen keyboard to select urdu)
palestine is the holiest place for muslims until the end of days and to ensure its security is our duty
we should also remember that it was our first qiblah
israel and india have to vanish one day since these countries are made to be broken and god will surely torment these disbelievers sajid sadiq lahore
when the night of loneliness can be passed by tearing down
when has misfortune departed by praying only (nawabzada nasrullah khan)
bbc searches for such comments and publishes them
after all they have to maintain the illusion of neutrality
although the news from bbc is usually correct but the real thing is the style of the news
what should be pointed out and what news should be given less importance
etc etc
zaheer chughtai
in this art nowadays the pakistani electronic and print media specially some urdu newspapers and columnists are not behind anyone who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism for the grudge of muavia written on them
has said that the united nations which apparently talks of human rights and peace but when it comes to grimness and coercion over muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that hamas should stop the attacks how long will this hypocrisy continue
why are there so many atrocities against muslims if people in america stop backing up the jews then allah almighty has said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life so if americans have courage then stop backing them and see then their fate in life
the just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice and not by being unjust and killing people
if killing a particular race off completely is the answer then hitlers plan would not have seen any jews survive and definitely not seen their rise
says a poet
injustice is injustice if it breeds it dies
blood is blood if it bleeds it dries
now who will tell whom what is terrorism
is all this not included in terrorism why does everybody worry only about their own pain
are others not human or is it that the blood of muslims has become so cheap was the blood of this many innocents not red
lastly why there is no condolence messages coming from anywhere
i watched the progress of the mumbai incident as if my own house was on fire the sorrow of humans can not be watched and who can not see this sorrow if only muslims would think a bit together
dead bodies on the road helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood how shall we condemn i can not find words
i feel like crying about the helplessness of muslims that on one side people are dying in india and the whole world is climbing onto pakistan without any proof and saying take action or else we will
and on the other side israel is ruthlessly killing muslims and the whole world is silent this is unbearable
god has light not darkness and when this darkness ends then
in the presence of america danger to the integrity of israel is a joke
considering elections the rulers should do such activities for peoples support there is no doubt in this specially when countries like israel exist rest talking about barrack obama then history is the witness that no american leader has gone against the policy and nor will do it regime whether black or white is a regime
from the discussions going on in the forum it seems that everyone is hurt over her death but as a politician her mistakes have not been ignored
this issue is debatable as to whether benazir gave her life for democracy or for power
if she sacrificed for democracy then why did she leave democracy in the dictatorship of musharraf for 10 years until she got a deal and american clearance
benazir did not come to pakistan when the people needed her the most unfortunately she came to pakistan when she had to deal with cases and was promised a seat of power
there is no one remaining to say about the criticism and accusations of a historical personality
sana khan
some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them
another reader
sir probably you should not only study pakistans history but that of 4 friends and 7 other countries maybe you would agree with psychos point of view
tariq ayaz
those who dont deserve an education shouldnt get it
the reflection of the pine in water never became green
britain never let them become one and invented the hindumuslim friction which was taken ahead by sir syed
psycho
how merciless is our nation we are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued no one is saying a word
we have progressed enough
sana khan
some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them just like a donkey doesnt become a scholar if you put books on him
although after the mumbai attacks there has been a setback in the dialog between pakistan and india however pakistan and india should continue these dialogs
if they talk about war then both sides will suffer human loss
india says that the man caught in the mumbai attacks is a pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to pakistan in urdu but on the other hand when india initially apprehended this extremist they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader point to be noted
first of all merry christmas to mr bhana and all christian friends of the forum
friends of the forum greetings mr psycho a raza sister sana sister shahida akram and all
we desire the flowers of peace rather than the flames of war
war itself is a problem
what problems can war solve
today it will give fire and blood
it will give hunger and need tomorrow
therefore wise people
it is better that war is postponed
in your and our garden
its better if lamp glows
the indiaamerica relations have deepened and india knows that when the time comes america will openly betray pakistan
this is also the old history of america
in the case of an indian attack americas goals will be fulfilled and the expenses will be indias
pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace reconciliation and ceasefire until india is completely destroyed or occupied even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so
this is the islamic history
even before this resolution the pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give
indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the mumbai attacks are making it clearer and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has relaxed its pressure now
while ignoring indias unnecessary bobbery the satisfaction of the united nations and the appreciation from the interpol chief over pakistans efforts is a side effect of indias overwhelming diplomacy
there are no two opinions over this it is a heinous act
but the question is that when thousands of taliban attacked the house of pir samiullah where and what was the pakistani army doing at that time
should the army not held accountable for what they did there for one year
how many taliban are killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday
and stop this fake operation
the day is not far when a resolution will be passed in the united nations against army intervention in pakistan the same way as it was passed against jamaathuddawah
first our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and god forbid the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in un
and suppose the passing of such a resolution is delayed some other strength will definitely leave our aid to ourselves keeping the example of america in front of them
we do not know about the personality and works of pir samiullah
probably he was not a revolutionary
as the bodies of comrade che guevara nawab akbar khan bagti dr najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy
they are eternal even after death
there is an international game being played here in which the public is ruled by fear through barbarism and ferociousness
the license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will seize the government
such actions of the socalled islam lovers in the name of religion is extremely disagreeable
the supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of america but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions they give it the name of tribal traditions and avoid it
no person with a heart can accept these beastly actions which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of islam
i think our army has joint these people
this is because these people take some time to move around to catch them will only take so much time but even if they were there they escape from there
are they so brave that they keep 5070 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators
they are servants of allah and so is the army
it is very clear that there is something fishy
instead of promoting gods blessing and merciful nature the discussion of various disastrous occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was seen and besides the event of hanging dead bodies their literature and books like what will happen after death also create fear and terror
and these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power
preachers
you frightened the world with the fire of hell
it is surprising when it is said that this cannot be the work of a muslim
we are either unaware of our own history or we ignore it for some reason
was the attack on medina by the army of yazid and the incident of karbala the conspiracy of jews and pagans
without accepting the facts neither motives can be removed nor can they be corrected
bbc people stop this dual policy
better than this topic the super hit title shoeing of bush fair or unfair
should have been
tahir chaudhry japan
please show some modesty a human was pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression and you are concerned about the topic of the box office
the success of operation sherdil and operation lion heart across the border depends on who is in the favor of public opinion
this is an act of american and pakistani agencies and peer sahab is a victim of this conspiracy
all discussions on this forum will now be anti taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined taliban and they are doing what can change the public opinion
i only want to ask when this body was hanging for a whole day what was the army doing are they only there for targeting the public they even report something like this bombing of taliban residences a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother
did they not know about this mistake
or were they watching the show
we say it with excuse that stop this game for allah sake
after all there is a ruler above you
whether the question asked by bbc is understandable or not it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer for instance no one asked what the army of 30000 in swat went there to do
the bodies of the taliban who help the army are left hanging on poles throughout the day
whatever the greenfooted pakistani government did with the swat public the media including bbc did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality
the pakistani army drama
every child in swat is saying that this is a bloody drama
for gods sake stop this drama
these talibans have destroyed the image of muslims
through out the world if muslims dont tell them muslims then why would terrorists are found in their territories
those who become insensitive and people who dont want to work hard take guns and join these groups
have shame
no religion or family tradition allows this
all media including the bbc show different views on taliban and tribals
but nobody knows what the actual situation is it is we who know about it because we are tribals
in short its a game in which the cia raw mosad and our own isi are invloved no one is a talib or a tribal who made these institutions warmongerswho are against islam taliban madrassas pushtoon people tribes and tribal traditions
this move has ashamed all the muslims
i salute mqms altaf hussain and the leadership of anp and ppp who speak against this cancer that is taliban
this cancer is a product of ziaulhaq who died but also destroyed pakistan
but i am hopeful that the present leadership will end this cancer
after the mumbai attacks india said that some extremists were behind the attacks
pakistan denies the blames and said it will give all possible assistance to india in interrogation
india said that it has given a list to pakistan of 20 suspected extremists wanted by india
now pakistan said that the jaishemohammad leader who is included in the list moulana masood azhar is not under house arrest and that the government of pakistan has no information about him
before that the president of pakistan asif ali zardari rejected the view that western spy agencies and the indian government had provided evidence related to the mumbai attacks
president zardari said regarding ajmal kasab that it is not yet proven that he is pakistani
meanwhile prime minister manmohan singh has warned pakistan that its relationship with india cannot improve if its land is being used for terrorism
in the latest development the indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to pakistan
should these political events affect sports
what do you see the future of indopak relations looking like
neither america nor india will break pakistan
pakistan will break itself
what do you expect after so much provincialism sectarianism and mullaism
time has proved that jinnah did not do good to the indian muslims
yasmin chicago
madam if mr jinnahs vision had been realized neither the cancer of provincialism sectarianism and mullaism would have spread in pakistan nor would the muslims in india have displayed such behavior
it is our mistake that we have not produced a leader of his caliber
if we cant respect our leaders then
this sector does have a lot of abilities
god knows when well understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity
in both countries the mullahs pundits taliban shiv sena and the rss etc have been established to oppose the peace process
and the evil powers dont want this region to progress therefore these countries are controlled like puppets
can you imagine what status will this region of pakistan india and china will have in the world
pakistan is under persecution from god that these thieves bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation
may god keep our country pakistan safe amen
butplease open your eyes to look at the situation and ground realities around you then you will come to know that where american troops have reached
other than the national matter are not looking good as well circumstances in sarhad balochistan karachi in sindh are in front of you
in this situation the country needs a leader who can unite us as a single nation
o allah have mercy on us
i think a last war is the only option
enough is enough
now it should be do or die
these false acts of cooperation will not solve the problem
nor will small terrorist attacks in each others countries
after all europe got settled after the final world war
if this war had not happened then they would all be talking like pakistan and india
almost all of our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be finished
but our military leadership does not seem to be sincere in these regards on the one hand america and europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism and on the other hand we secretly help the taliban
we should think and fix our direction and choose only one way thanks
there is no doubt that the majority of the members of jamaatuddawa are also members of lashkeretayyaba who joined the party named jamaatuddawa pakistan after lashkeretayyaba was invalidated
however after more focus was diverted towards humanitarian activities on indias strong request the united nations has also banned it the government of pakistan has also implemented a crackdown on this organization
in my opinion it would be better if jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities
the present terrorist groups that bring up criminals in the name of jihad and the elders of these mullas are the same people who used to call pakistan palidistan and other derogatory terms
now they are not leaving any stone unturned in destroying pakistan
they do not deserve to be called humans let alone muslims
without cleaning pakistan of these mischief mongers the national security will remain at risk
is there still room to consider whether these scoundrels should be banned
there is no place in this world for extremist mullahs whose only purpose is to kill
this news tore my heart
what kind of world is this where one cannot survive as an important part of allahs religion islam
nonmuslims can kill muslims but if a muslim even tries to extract revenge along with the whole nonmuslim world even the hypocrite leaders join and treat those who have sincere religious feeling like our great leaders are treating hafiz saeed
as a penalty of mumbai attacks india
pakistani relations are affected and the recent improvement in relations between the two countries are stopped
india has always held the military and nonmilitary groups in pakistan responsible
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the action against these groups
whereas indian security agencies have accused lashkaretaiba of being directly responsible for the mumbai attacks
in this case the name jamatuddawa has popped up many times
this is the first time that relations between both countries have worsened due to a terrorist activity in india
in december 2001 after the attacks on the indian parliament these two neighbors were on the brink of war
after that in 2002 lashkeretayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists
now it is being demanded that jamaathud dawah which according to security reports is just a new form of lashkaretaiba also be banned
in your opinion should this group be banned or not
should pakistan take decisive action against active extremist groups on her soil
can by banning jamat adawa present india
can the crisis be over and how important is it to close down the armed groups to keep constant peace between both countries
security council of the united nations has banned jamatuddawa after all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly
does the security council always show urgency against the muslims
when the accuser is lazy the witness is active
india itself has become a failed government
whose intelligence army and other security officials have become useless who for 72 hours has danced the dance of mole with terrorists and india is cheating the world by blaming pakistan over its uselessness
when one disbeliever dies there is hue and cry in the whole world why these double standards
countries only religious and nonpolitical welfare organization
furqan farooq faisalabad
as long as our prophet (pbuh) the awliya kiram and the sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect the religion of islam would spread and prosper with peace
muslims have also advanced in every field
when this beautiful religion came to ordinary people then divisions arose between muslims and non muslims and a new era of tumults and quarrel began previously the world was not aware of this
salam please do it with pleasure but act on your own
dont do it under the pressure of america
if india is aggrieved it should provide the evidence
why doesnt it give it
and why does it accuse us of everything
as there are extremist groups and organizations in india why dont they put sanctions on them
are we the only terrorists in the world
what is it that india is doing in kashmir
what is it that israel is doing
the truth is that we are the first islamic nuclear state what the fight is about
pakistan is now in the last stages
kamranhassan abu dhabi
your words touch the heart and the situation seems so
american magazines are boldly printing the new map of pakistan and all these sanctions seem to be part of this conspiracy
americans are now not slowly but very swiftly tightening their grip over pakistan
in this situation if we do not stand together and show our unity then remember if bangladesh can be made then anything can happen
terrorist attacks should be condemned to the maximum whether they are on the mumbai hotel or the marriot hotel in islamabad or in palestine
these terorrists should be punished whether they are from pakistan india america or israel
now the question remains why the whole world including the pakistani officials is silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in pakistan resulting in the death of hundreds of people
was the attack on the marriott hotel a terrorist act
then why
hats off to home adviser mr rahman malik masha allah he has become so brave and courageous
not only this but according to bbc mr malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists has been carried out under someones pressure
brother subhanallah
whether having the ability or not or to say that i dont want
whose war are we pakistanis fighting
and why we have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect
no one has the right to interfere in any countrys affairs
the colonial system is apparently not there
if people expect justice or demand that an external united court be established to respect democratic institutions and not help any dictator or military regime there could be peace in the third world including pakistan
pakistan is already in favor of the european union and america
this happens despite the opposition of a majority of the pakistani population
and this causes more opposing feelings
if america and its allies believe in democracy they should give up their colonial behavior and leave this region
pakistan has the ability to arm or disarm itself
security forces raided an alleged camp of banned lashkaretaiba in pakistan administered kashmir
since the mumbai attacks pressure is increasing on pakistan to act against the extremist organizations
india claims that lashkaretayyaba was involved in the mumbai attacks
he said that the extremists whom attacked mumbai used pakistani earth
during this the peshawar government says that unknown armed persons set another convoy of goods for allied forces deployed in afghanistan on fire destroying more than 50 vehicles
this is the second attack in peshawar on nato and american supplies in the last 48 hours
during this pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned lashkr e taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from karachi to tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action
the question is does pakistan want to do it
does pakistan have the ability to do so
what do you say

i ask only one question from the flag holders of humanity
if you kill their children and they bring necklace for you this is impossible
and question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies say any logic argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men laborers and poor workers of different occupations in revenge of american attack
if the answer is no then you should realize your need to correct your point of view
people were armed at that time it was dangerous that russia will turn toward pakistan after afghanistan therefore people were armed
now when there is the danger of american attack via afghanistan of which current american president clearly expressed in his presidential campaign then why should we disarm these people
only for this that after defeating pakistani army america or india may not face any public resistance
yes if any of them is involved in sabotage activities then only pakistan should take action against him
but this is more that government against lashkaretaiba proves correct by india that pakistan is involve in that
najeebur rahman syco lahore
even if we accept that lashkaretaiba is guilty it is still not correct to blame the pakistani government
and another question arises did these terrorists not have the aid of some government or nongovernment employee of india
are the terrorists born or made only in pakistan and not in india or other nations of the world
as far as lashkaretayyaba is concerned it has no involvement in the recent incidents
it must be recalled that hafiz saeed was the first militant leader who declared activities of taliban revolt
i am sure that the taliban effect is an inseparable result of american plans hence every person who can stand in the way of the taliban must be removed
to terminate the expedition started by the american and saudi funding they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society
one should also protest against them that according to ethics america and saudi arabia distributed dangerous weapons and named jihadis but in reality spread the virus of hateful literature and culture due to which slaughter houses were opened in our country
after the threat of attack from india announcement of the pakistani army that they will divert their attention to india by removing the army from afghanistan and the announcement of taliban that they will take care of the afghan border america stumbled badly and tried its best that india should attack pakistan
this showed the strength of america in the region
although india did not even threaten nor does it have the guts to
the remaining damage is done by the taliban attacking the american convoy
that proves that without the pakistani army and the pakistani government america is nothing
karachi business financial center of pakistan is the dubai of underdeveloped areas
hundreds of thousands do not return emptyhanded from here but since the law was enforced on the western borders karachi has taken all the attention
now they are looking to kidnap this city
for the first time pathans are called pashtoons they are made to fight by making them strangers to each other although the need is to be united
one solution of the problem is that the urdu speaking people learn pushto or the pushto speaking learn urdu or if everyone learns english the better
you will surely think this as a ridiculous suggestion but do you think that the reason for this conflict is not ridiculous
the reason of violence is language
zaheer chughtai
sir i actually shared this proposal many times in my childhood with my friends which included people from all religious and linguistic groups but these people used to laugh at me
at that time the religious and linguistic hate which was not as lively and strong as they are today were still developing within
do not understand what and why is this happening
are these the signs of judgement day
for what crime are innocent people being killed
the reasons are in front of everybody those who want to break up pakistan are the active ones and those who do such things have neither religion nor country
be it karachi or mumbai the houses were set on fire by its own residents
when the government comes they just change names of the places to build a name for themselves these days airports roads and buildings are all named benazir
does benazir describe what is happening to the public of karachi and pakistan
when the bombay attacks were at their peak the failure of the efforts of the ra to spread chaos in karachi proves that political elements formerly working on the payroll of ra have now resigned from their posts
the unjustified killing of pashtospeaking hard workers and indian threats have awakened sleeping pakistanis from karachi to khyber
the identical country loving reaction of all the political religious linguistic and national parties has not only taught india the manners of diplomacy but it has also given the american policy makers a chance to think again
mqm and anp are responsible for the worse situation in karachi and administration is not neutral
administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately
pressure of political parties on police and rangers keeps them from doing the operation
the talk of uniting is restricted to speeches the political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man
these kinds of incidents will keep taking place until there is pressure on the administration
i think these people are the biggest terrorists
and foreign powers are definitely involved in this but no one knows who they are
the saddest part is if this kind of situation occurred in some city in sarhad the government would have done something but if it is not in sarhad the government would be so helpless
the government should set up an operation here and save a big and important town from terrorism
otherwise pakistan will face a huge financial crisis
even bbc urdu is not writing the truth due to fear and as for the local media it is even thinner
the whole truth is available on bbc english
one solution to the problem is that either the urduspeaking people learn pushtun or the pushtunspeaking people learn urdu even better both could learn english
you will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but dont you think the reason for collision is ridiculous
that the cause of extremism be language
there was another story of cruelty recorded in karachi the terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time
no one left any stone unturned the reports that surfaced in the media only told 50 of what actually happened here in four days
i have spent the last three nights sleepless and the fear is still there
who evacuated hotels killed cobblers peanut sellers
the people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of allahs punishment which can catch them anytime
in your opinion what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance
(bbc)
in light of the gruesome bloodshed event in mumbai we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the cause of the disorder in karachi it seems that the turmoil is due to an unconscious trade of blood
it is obvious that if someone mistreats the father it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control
the blood of liyaqath ali khan and many other brave hearts was also from there i am writing this poem to get rid of saikos misunderstanding
we will also repeat the traditions of the elders
they gave their lives to build we will give our lives to save
faizan tauseef siddiqui
it is very disappointing that the whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other
mr siddiqui i request if wikipedia
org is searched for liaqat ali khan you will know that he belonged to a noble punjabi family of an area of punjab karnal
because of his service to the muhajirs they consider him their leader
every action has a reaction
one can bear ones self but
ijaz awan
sir before you gather a huge crowd very quickly i should tell you that you are finding the graffiti of real gangsters these days on the walls of karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters
we have been bearing both types of mischief
mischief mongers did not leave pakistan or the founder of pakistan they did not have to face any reaction
in return creating problems for the same country pakistan
only the muslim league (n) was left she also handed over the draft of the 18th amendment to the peoples party
before this mqm and muslim league q made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment to the national assembly and the senate
until now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment are a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved
this is the reason why no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change
it seems that by submitting the draft of the 18th amendment these parties have beaten around the bushes meaning they can claim that they had submitted the amendment but the ruling partys speaker did not proceed
mqm is a coalation with the government muslim league(n) is a secret partnership with the government the muslim league(q) is the party that passed the 17th amendment now how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17th amendment
this is called getting credit for nothing
anyway the peoples party is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment
how can someone think of cutting their own hands
as long as zardari is the president seventeenth amendment is not going to be cancelled
this was the opinion of the majority in one of our surveys and it is correct
if the 17th amendment was discarded then zardari would have never become the president
now he is even more powerful than president musharaf because along with being the president he is also the chairman of the peoples party
as long as he is the president the seventeenth amendment will remain intact
in order to finish the 17th amendment the political parties will have to bid zardari farewell from the presidential house
neither mqm nor other parties want this
most of the elders in our family belonged to the working class
in our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor we used to pray to allah please save us from this hard labor
to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily amroz and asked him what we should do after matriculation so that we dont have to do labor
the editor wrote in reply that we should become a doctor or engineer and take such and such subjects
we were inclined towards engineering and in matriculation we studied technical drawing instead of biology
but at the time of admission in fsc my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing fsc in medical
we hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldnt understand a thing we swapped biology for mathematics
fear of labor made me an engineer and now i am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which i am always thankful to god
i remembered this when i was trying to lift the carpet with my two young sons at our old house
we said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor
the son said i am studying and will continue studying but i cannot do this work
the three of us finished that work in three hours and returned
my purpose is that if a person has set a goal whatever the reason behind it no one can stop him from achieving his goal
but if you dont even know what you have to do then god be with you
it is said that do not say bad about the dead but what shall we do we see only bad things in benazir even on her first death anniversary
on one side benazir crushed independence movement of sikhs by handing over the list of sikh freedom fighters to india for her own sake and on the other hand provided india an opportunity to fully concentrate in kashmir after crushing the movement in punjab
the greed of benazir and nawaz sharif for government pushed the country back many years
during her exile benazir continued to give negative statements on kashmir and the atomic program
benazir violated the london agreement with nawaz sharif and made a deal with general musharaf
during her reign benazir provided her husband the opportunity of making money and because of this he popularized as mr 10 percent
in benazirs era her brother was killed and his killer is still not been punished
despite being a woman benazir avoided fighting for womens rights
just as benazir did her politics over her fathers dead body similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body
benazir came into power twice but she could not punish her the culprits of her fathers political murder even she couldnt register a case against them
it has been 37 years since east pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day
we should have been observing december 16 as a day of reflection and making plans to prevent the reoccurrence of such incidents
on this day we could send greetings to the people of bangladesh and try to bring them closer to us again
the rulers should reopen the hamudur rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of east pakistan
they used to make arrangements to bring back the biharis trapped in bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits
we have become so insensitive that if someone dies in our neighborhood we are not even aware of it
we dont care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish
even after big tragedies we return to our routine life the next day
as east and west germany reunite i wish east and west pakistan would follow suit
we can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness
but this wish does not seem to be fulfilled in the near future
it was announced in the news today that the governor of the american state illinois had been arrested on corruption charges
and to remove him from governorship provincial congress is preparing for his rapid accountability our american friend who has a keen interest in pakistani affairs said to me see this is democracy
in america even the higher level people are not above the law
and there is your country pakistan whose president has been elected after his corruption charges were dropped
my sense of humor rouse and i said whats strange if a governor has been arrested in america in our pakistan prime minister was arrested overnight and once was hanged and second time was exiled
tell me has it ever happened in america
pakistan awarded the person who broke the law with a guard of honor from the presidency when did this happen in america
in pakistan the chief justice was suspended and besides public support he has yet to be restored has that ever happened in america
in pakistan a fakedegree holder was made the minister of health did this happen in america
by hearing this american laughed like mads and also accepted his defeat
in this picture president zardari is smiling despite being surrounded on all four sides by americans
it seems from his smile
he thinks that america is with his government he is forgetting that one year ago they were with pervez musharraf
this picture has been taken as it was a family gathering
a photo like this a president with three american officials has never published in the papers before
it seems as if americas work in pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one
it is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of president zardari breaking his promises
if it had been a sensible ruler at least he would not have been grinning during the photo session and he would have had a subservient and embarrassing look on his face
if the principle of democracy is applied to this picture then president zardari is in the minority
in democracy majority rules the country and the picture reveals the actual rulers
paradiselike swat is also called the switzerland of pakistan
even now according to government policy cross talks continue along side the use of force
but the use of force is not giving any benefit other than increasing the force of the taliban and increasing the public favor for them
what is needed of the government is to address the root cause of this menace instead of using force
by finishing the causes fazlullah and the taliban will be finished themselves
the sharia bill proposed by anp will solve the problems in swat to a great extent
but alongside the establishment of the shariah the government will also have to take care of economic problems
from the early steps of general musharaf it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians but the lust of power changed all his plans
and whatever steps were expected were no more
as soon as bushs era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment made a deal with the thieves
even then general musharraf could have commanded the army but the present government does not even know what is happening
in swat the strongly affected part of sarhad state despite the continuity of military action for over one year the situation is still going from bad to worse
on one hand the government is reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly on the other hand the talibans illegal radio fm channel is having much more influence in the region
on the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area
the security forces claimed to have killed many extremists during gunship helicopter attacks and artillery bombardment but in spite of these killings the taliban has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of swat
on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat but on the other hand the taliban is stronger
who is stuck in between the poor civilians
it is said in swat that someone asked what kind of people the taliban were so he got the answer they are very good as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of allah and the religion
then asked how is army the answer was that the army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country
then it was asked who are the enemies of religion and the country and the answer was the citizens
i am astonished how the pakistani army will fight with the indian army while it is unable to control a small group of taliban
they could not track down talibans illegally operated fm channel which in my opinion is very easy
but still the fm channel is spreading poison with all vigor
after the girls schools now boys schools are being destroyed
a curfew is imposed so that talibans can move around easily
tonight eight trucks entered the suburbs of mingora during curfew and created bunkers
the question is that how could they reach there during curfew
the army could kill akbar bugti in his house and salutes the taliban
for gods sake someone tell this army to protect the helpless people of sawat from the taliban and prove that the pakistan army can overcome any enemy
he says that most of the blood is spilled in the name of religion tell me if there was no religion would blood not have spilled
are punjabi pathan white black mahsood and other tribes the result of religion
not at all sir religion preaches to us that there is no white or black no punjabi or muhajir if there is no religion then half of the world would have been destroyed by the war between black and white and remaining half by the war of caste
actually religion gives moral teachings to man and binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here and he should spend his life according to his teachings
as a muslim i am completely convinced that islam is a complete way of life and the true religion
after living in london for many years i used to ask wellness of my family over the phone every morning although most of them did not even call once to find out how we were then i realized that they do not even like our phone calls so we stopped calling
living here in france for two years i also felt the same way
i dont know why people always expect us to call them
resolution about iraq passed in a few hours sending un peace force to darfur is not a problem
immediately criticizing the mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours
and where death is dancing we are consenting
o upholders of world peace life is finishing over here
are people really waiting for it to finish
so that any again no aggrieved could even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights
when a father keeps running taking the dead body of his beloved soneven then you dont feel any pain in your heart
if not then you dont even deserve to be called a human being
rather you are a blemish on the name of humanity
ok it was proven that this area was also the home of the israelis for thousands of years
ideally these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection but since their strings are in the hands of the western and arab countries peace is not possible without their will
now even iran wants to fight its proxy war from here
even if operations in israel are stopped for the time being they will start again after some other incident
the interest of bbcs country is subject to the bestowing of america and israel and this is why in the name of enlightenment they have come with a series of blogs based on darkness and a blind propaganda
bbc is only carrying the formality and its objective is to have sympathies
i request the moderator to publish this comment from fidwi so that some truth may still remain on bbc
thanks
i dont know who wrote this story or how this story came to being but one thing is for sure in every age draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people
in every age wars have been fought and blood has been spilled
but the surprising thing is that this 21st century man who considers himself civilized is quiet over this ruthless open massacre
how can he not realize that whatever is happening is showing the ugliest face of humanity

all these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase why would they care if the country lasts or not

its sole purpose is to extract money from the government
as for the public they are ignorant to speak about them is the biggest ignorance
yesterday noon strange thing happened
all the police are running around but they do not check illegal parking
not this nypd traffic was not in the mood of noticing illegally parked vehicles
it happened that a plane of us air really became a plane and landed in the hudson river
till today only this much is known that the terrorist belonged to the family of birds called goose
yesterday was perhaps historic cold in new york
the temperature does not fall this low
even my jaw started hurting from my half an hour walk outside
imagine what would have happened to those people who jumped from the plane into the river
happy news is that the people all stayed safe
and the sad news is that ship sank in this financial crisis

we considered the taliban group of swat to be only against womens education
they show their anger by demolishing schools and colleges for women
like the majority of the ideas this was not proven right according to cnn news on the lucky day of monday a group of taliban demolished a boys school with gunpowder
south taliban has demolished boys school
the girls schools were already destroyed according to the famous english saying ladies first i do not know why people are still bent on calling the taliban uncultured and barbaric
another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the taliban that they are against girls education is not true
rather masha allah they are against education altogether
may allah give these mujahideen more power and the evil government
destroying those who rule on us may allah help them
some days go a girls marriage with a dog become fresh

humanity is rare in the 21st century
today is the age of computer and computers interference is growing in every aspect of life
many people have reservations over this increasing involvement of the computer in financial matters
while use of credit card bring ease to life it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life
that just by tracking the record of your credit card you can be exposed
and in future when use of currency will be minimal its utility will increase
similarly in the world of crime instead of facing the dangers of robbing a bank credit card information is stolen
similarly friends are also made through computers
social networking websites like orcet facebook and myspace are ranked first in popularity
but dont you feel that psychologically the more we accustome ourselves to social networks the more we are physically getting away from people
also consider matchmaking websites where your preferences are matched to a list of people with similar desires as you
now can you spend your life with a person exactly like you
i cant do it that is why a life partner is called my better half
that heshe may cover my deficiencies
perhaps i received a lesser share of wisdom
since childhood whenever an elder said anything to me that was the truth for me
and so i had assurance that my father knew the answer to every question in the world
i was laughed upon for it
but only that saying seemed true which is possible
i was always perplexed at the need to tell a lie
even at this age i suffered because of it
that is why i try to lie as little as possible
dont tell lies especially in the name of god
and only say god willing when i wished the work be done
allah knows the states intention
this is a disgusting problem which is created because of a distance from religion
according to our religion and the law of pakistan minor should stay with their mother
their father is responsible for their maintenance allowance and he can meet them
then when the kids become mature they can decide with whom they want to live
you have mentioned correctly that the real problem is the relatives who poison the minds
possessiveness is present in all our actions
even here is thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in fathers property so it is resisted although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated
these restrictions regarding relations have created many evils in society
the concept of marriage of a divorcee or a widow is ending
due to these unnecessary beliefs and traditions the family system is facing disarray
in our society if the wife of a 5055 year old man or the husband dies and he remarries why is he looked down upon
a pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago had all his children married but when he married a widow his own children went against him
in my opinion this is religious right what do you say
to take place of our mother in the being of our mother what kind of thinking
i believe that this persons children should have thought whats wrong if he married a widow after he married off all his children
this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house
because his children would certainly be busy in their worldly affairs and would not be having time for him
the reason for this is ignorance
this is a result of pressure from society
when people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that children start to feel ashamed of their fathers second marriage
though they should face the environment and say that their fathers action is in perfect accordance with islam
this is the curse of our society which have been facing for the last 4050 years
even a wife is agreed on the unethical activities of her husband but does not allow her for second marriage
if she had the power she would not allow him to do this even after her death
she destroys her husband and her own hereafter and becomes a cause for spreading filth in society
nothing happens with the singing about islam we actually like what our traditions and cultures are
for instance keeping girls from gaining an education and the fear of marrying ones choice
as for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt)
in indoppak we embraced islam centuries ago but cant get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then islam
thinking of a mans second marriage as an innovation divorce as a clinical rest divorced woman as untouchable love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife is all a part of this mentality
moreover to copy the western nations we declare veil and worship backward
it was easy to embrace islam to get rid of such thinking is very difficult
allah grant us all spirit and courage for this

when i was coming back to the shop after isha prayer tonight one man who was sitting in a car raised his hand and asked me to come
i thought that probable this man has lost his way or wants to ask something i stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car
he asked whether i could understand arabic well or not i said no problem tell me what you want
he started to say that i have come from riyadh to madinah but someone has pickpocketed me so please help me out i asked him to excuse me as such an incident had taken place with me previously i had given someone 20 riyals to buy petrol to reach riyadh but he went a little ahead and started to ask somebody else
i was furious i cursed him and threatened him of the police then he ran away
now the situation has become that we muslims come in cars with our families to beg all day and gain at least two or three thousand illegally
however there is a clear hadith (saaw) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one
may allah bless us and make us true muslims (amen)

all the people of kashmiris have been fighting a war of independence for the past sixty years
no no one asked now they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism they have started talking about peace and settlement
first they killed muslims brutally and now they are trying to resolve issues
pakistan has to understand their twoway policy
asad khan london
india is creating such a situation that the worlds attention can be diverted from kashmir
but pakistan has always shown the real face of india to the world
now the british government also understands that india made a bad image of pakistan in the name of terrorism to turn back eyes on kashmir occupation
and they hesitate to talk to pakistan over this issue
british foreign minister david miliband said that resolving the kashmir issue will end extremism the pakistan government will be able to handle the border issues
it should be noted that american president obama has already expressed similar views on the kashmir issue
the british foreign minister while talking to media in mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president bush
david miliband has said that pakistan should show leniency towards extremist groups
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the kashmir dispute from the major powers isnt india trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region
isnt the terrorism in mumbai a part of this strategy
does india want to avoid the comprehensive talks by on the basis of terrorism

i think the big powers do not want to harm pakistan
but they are thinking of plans to keep it on their leash as they know that pakistan is a nuclear power
they want to create an environment of revolution
foreign countries are thinking that if pakistan is cornered it will pose more political and geographical problems they want to help pakistan and want to achieve their vested interests

american president george w bush in his last press conference advised newly elected president barack obama that he made many mistakes in his tenure and barack obama should do what he thinks is right
as the president i have taken steps according to the situation and the constitution and under the law given priority to the american interests on my popularity
he said that the enemies of america are still planning to attack america and that the biggest challenge for barack obama would be to stop those attacks
he said that not to get the mass destruction weapons was my largest disappointment and the biggest mistake was to admit the completion of the iraq mission

this is a very hurtful incident that israel is publicly massacring the palestinians the same situation is here in kashmir but the security council does not even bother with it
all the organizations present in palestine and kashmir should keep their war going until they gain independence and they should form unity among themselves and keep facing any type of harm and eventually their martyrdom will give fruit god willing
israeli air attacks are still continued on gaza hundreds of palestinian men women and children have been martyred
important political leader hamas nazarian has been martyred with his wife and kids
the meeting of security council ended without any decision
the condemning resolution presented by libya and other arab countries against israel is facing american opposition in the meeting
israels jet planes have been bombarding residential areas of palestine for the last few days
the whole world reacted on mumbai attacks but no countries including america and england can see the bloodshed caused by israeli attacks
why are the major countries of the muslim world silent

i think the actual point is that the majority of our nation is illetrate they do not know where their money is going the government is interested in applying taxes and fulfilling their duties the shortage of electricity and gas will remain same
because everyone knows about the character of those who have been elected by our own nation
the electricity and gas crisis across pakistan has taken a serious position
on the other hand gas prices have been raised by the average of eight percent while in a few cities the unavailability of petrol caused extreme alarm for people
among the manufacturing and business circles there are strong protests and severe protests against the long power cut and gas crisis
industrialist have given an ultimatum before closing the factories
here there is growing anxiety among those dwelling in karachi because of eight to ten hours electricity load shedding
industrial sector is almost paralyzed
government institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other
are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas a joke against the nation
why is attention not being paid to solving the problems
cant the government see the failing of the countrys economy
what immediate steps would you recommend for managing this crisis
please give us your opinion

indians attitudes have changed after the mumbai attack
jagjit singh has shown by his reaction that he hates pakistan and the pakistanis
it should be known that adnan sami has sung with asha bhonsle how has he become helpless now adnan sami should stay in india there is no need for him to come here
muhammad shamshad alam
karachi on the statement of jagjit singh i would only say that he changes color like a chameleon
who gives statements suitable to the situation pakistanis open your eyes how much are you given worth in india try to understand the thinking of hindu
after the mumbai incident their hateful statements have increased and now they are spitting poison against popular singer adnan sami
after this the journalist removed his shoe and threw it at bush president bush saved himself and expertly ducked before the shoe couldstrike him
the second shoe hit the american flag
