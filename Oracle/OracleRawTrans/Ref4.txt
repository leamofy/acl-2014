keep off dieting to avoid the flu
this study of us scientists is the result of tests carried out on mice
the research found that mice fed with a lowcalorie diet had relatively weaker immune systems for fighting off the flu virus
according to the scientists one should eat well when suffering from a fever

thomas reed who has worked as a weapons designer at livermore national laboratory in the united states has written a book in collaboration with danny stillman former director of the technical intelligence division at los alamos national laboratory
in their book the nuclear express a political history of the bomb and its proliferation reed and stillman claim that every country that has ever produced a nuclear bomb has been able to do so because it stole the nuclear secrets of another country or enjoyed the cooperation of another nuclear power
in an interview with us news and world report reed alleged that it was china who conducted the first nuclear test for pakistan in 1990 during benazir bhuttos first term in office
thomas reed said that he was sure that china had conducted pakistans nuclear testing for several reasons
these reasons included the design of the bomb and information gathered in interviews with chinese scientists
he added that this was why pakistan was able to conduct nuclear testing in 1998 just two weeks and three days after indias nuclear explosions
reed recalled that in 1961 the former soviet union had conducted a surprise nuclear test and the united states took 17 days to respond despite the fact that it had possessed nuclear bombs for a long time
he added that the bomb that pakistan tested in 1998 was made with extreme care and pakistani scientists had complete trust in its effectiveness
when reed was asked if china had also provided pakistan with nuclear technology he replied that india was the common enemy of both pakistan and china
he said that there was evidence that dr abdul qadir khan had used the chinese model a fact that was later confirmed by documents from libya
in response to another question whether conducting joint nuclear testing was a routine occurrence he said that the united states openly carried out nuclear tests for britain in the nevada desert in 1990
he added that israel was presumably given access to the results of these tests
reed was also asked whether china was continuing its nuclear proliferation program
reed responded that china had provided the raw materials instructions and design for the nuclear installation at isfahan in 1991
china has also provided iran with its enrichment plant at kherej

exchange of heated words between turkish prime minister and israeli president
recep tayyip erdogan told the israeli president who was speaking in a loud voice you killed lots of innocent people in gaza i find it very sad that people are applauding the israeli military offensive
erdogan said peres had spoken so loudly to conceal his guilt adding that israel had killed people and recalling the children who were slaughtered along the coast
peres said that it was not israel but hamas who was responsible for the gaza tragedy as it had established a dictatorship over there
the bbc correspondent in davos said that such scenes have never been witnessed before in the world economic forum
however later erdogan said that he respected the israeli president and his age which was why he did not shout at him but what peres was saying was far removed from reality

the eus role in peace in the middle east
technically speaking the eu group plays a decisive role in helping to prevent war in the middle east
according to brussels the schwarzenberg delegation and sarkozy are meant to complement one another
eu commission spokesman amadeu altafaj drily commented that any effort is welcome as long as it sends a unified message on behalf of the eu to the parties to the conflict
all is well as far as official rhetoric is concerned
in reality the eu is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict
on the one hand there is the weak czech president of the eu
hindered by internal squabbling over europe
on the other hand there is the former french president of the eu who would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as eu president
but france has already completed its sixmonth term of presidency
sarkozy wants to lead and is capable of it but is no longer allowed to
especially disturbing is the stance of french foreign minister bernard kouchner
he is part of the troika led by the czech republics foreign minister schwarzenberg
it is a particularly delicate situation because kouchner and schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the mideast conflict
schwarzenberg focuses on israels right to defend itself while kouchner says israels military actions are disproportionate whats more the germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically on behalf of the german government
the result can be seen in the attitude of the israeli government which seems to find all european attempts at diplomacy irrelevant
there is a good chance that the europeans can play a constructive role in the region because the us has failed in the middle east due to george w bushs policies
economic crisis german billionaire commits suicide
adolf merckle who lived in swabia an area of southern germany has left behind a vast business group
but until fairly recently most germans didnt know much about him
he became the subject of headlines when he had to negotiate with nearly 30 banks to provide loans to his industrial group and realized that the merckle group was doomed
he lost massive amounts of money after a speculative investment in volkswagen shares went the wrong way and lost several million euros due to the financial crisis
and when banks refused to provide him the 700 to 1 billion euro loan that was crucial to his groups survival he came under further pressure
earlier these same banks had agreed to provide loans to the merckle group on an emergency basis and adolf merckle who had risen from being a small industrialist to leading a group with an annual income of 30 billion euros could not bear the collapse of his industrial empire
after taking charge of the family business following his fathers death adolf merckle developed it along modern lines and saw it flourish
he named his company ratiopharm which is now a leading pharmaceutical company in germany
the pharmaceutical companys dividends rose to 56 billion euros yet it still earned an annual profit of 81 billion euros after ratiopharms success the merckle group purchased shares of major corporations including heidelbergcement and car manufacturer kaessbohrer
the merckle group employs around 100000 people worldwide and ratiopharm also plays a vital role for the groups finances
adolf merckle had said our family has been involved in the production of medicines for four generations
now this company is being managed by my sons and i hope that it will remain in the family for centuries to come
korassio farm will have to be sold to improve the groups long term financial condition a bridge loan of 400 million euros was approved for vem but it came through only after merckles death
now that adolf merckle has died the merckle group wont have the attraction that it once had
crime rate among foreigners in germany
according to bavarias interior minister joachim herrmann it is just an apparent change
he said it is also pertinent to note that the number of foreigners seeking german citizenship has increased
for this reason he felt that the statistics should represent criminals who are german citizens with foreign backgrounds
herrmann said that this fact will be taken into account during the collection of statistics for his province in 2010
the province of hamburg is thinking along the same lines as bavaria
a cdu senator on interior affairs christoph ahlhaus said when an investigation is carried out on a scientific basis you cant come up with the results of your choice they depend on the outcome of statistics gathered as a result of investigation
ahlhaus referred to an analytical report of the provinces anticrimes department that was prepared in 2006 which assessed the rate of foreignerperpetrated crimes in the city of hamburg
the results showed that the rate of involvement of foreigners
in crimes is far less than it is in other provinces
however when the rate of youthperpetrated crimes in berlin was assessed in 2006 it showed that foreign youths
accounted for 44 percent of those crimes
the leftist spd and greens and other political parties like linspartei are opposed to the proposal that data should be gathered on the foreign background of german criminals when collecting crime statistics

germany has 3000 troops with nato forces in afghanistan
in october of last year the german parliament passed a bill to send 1000 additional troops to afghanistan
this is the first alqaeda message that germany has received

for some years now alqaeda has been releasing video messages on the internet and these messages have been followed by attacks
taliban militants accepted responsibility for saturdays suicide attack outside the german embassy
most german newspapers and experts view this attack in the context of the video message
they are targeting germany
radical muslims are critical of germanys afghanistan policy
they accuse the german government of pursuing a biased policy not only toward afghanistan but also in the middle east
and therefore consider germany as a foe
meanwhile the german government has stated that german intelligence agencies were aware of the video before it became public
germanys federal anticrimes agency is scrutinizing the video

it is the first missile attack in pakistans tribal area since barack obama took over as us president
nwfp government spurns taliban demand for ban on education for girls
nwfp officials have spurned the taliban threat for a ban on education for girls saying that the verdict was contrary both to the law and islamic teachings
nwfp education minister sardar hussain babr said on sunday that the government will not encourage such a move at all
he said that the extremists want to deprive local children of education
in his own words these people try to blow up schools and intimidate girls
referring to the atmosphere of harassment he said that the government was aware of the situation and wants to make it clear that no force will prevent the spread of education in pushtun areas
a day earlier taliban militants led by maulana fazlullah demanded a ban on education for girls in the educational institutions of swat and threatened to blow up the schools violating that order
despite the ongoing military operation in swat militants have destroyed about 150 schools during the past year and a half
as a result thousands of students have been denied access to educational facilities
security heightened in india on the occasion of republic day
india will observe its 60th republic day on monday strict security arrangements have been made and thousands of troops have been deployed across the country
weapons aircraft and other defense equipment will be deployed in the military parade in the capital new delhi on the occasion of republic day
officials say that other security arrangements antiaircraft guns and sharp shooters have also been deployed while police are keeping strict watch on parade routes us president barack obama congratulated india on this occasion
he also sent a message for the early recovery of indian prime minister manmohan singh who underwent heart surgery on saturday
indian police claimed to have killed two suspected pakistani militants in a shootout in a new delhi suburb two days ago
according to the police rifles grenades ak47 rifles and some documents showing that they were pakistani were recovered from them
police are investigating whether the two had links with pakistans banned outfit laskhare taiba which was behind the mumbai attacks in november last year
tea effective cure for breast cancer
new research reveals that drinking three cups of tea daily
reduces the risk of breast cancer in women below the age of 50
research provided by the moft cancer center in the us state of florida said that women below the age of 50 can reduce the risk of breast cancer
the research said that the intake of three or more cups of tea by older women does not provide any noteworthy benefits
the experts are of the opinion that tea contains ingredients that are more effective against particular breast tumors that usually target woman below 50 years of age
the moft cancer center in tampa florida conducted research on over 5000 women who underwent breast cancer treatment
the experts compared their medical records and lifestyle with the women who were safe from breast cancer
the experts have also learned that tea has a significant effect on a particular form of cancer lobler which was reduced by 66 per cent
about every tenth person with breast cancer has this type of cancer
this type of cancer is more dangerous because it is found deep in the body and can only be diagnosed once it has spread to a great extent
experts are of the opinion that the risk of breast cancer in young women can be significantly reduced if they drink at least three cups of tea regularly
they find that including tea as a daily beverage helps produce the appropriate immunity in the body against cancer
in britain about 40000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year
afghan war biggest challenge facing the united states gates
us defense secretary robert gates has said that the afghan war is the biggest military challenge facing the us
gates briefed the us senate and house of representatives members today on the obama administrations iraqi and afghan war strategy
gates told the senates armed forces committee that war was not the only solution to the afghan issue but he added further that in several areas that are being exploited by the taliban there are not enough troops present to secure the region
why reduce exercise as you age
new research
exercise is good for health at any age
it makes your heart stronger reduces your cholesterol level is helpful in reducing weight helps prevent diabetes and slows alzheimers
unfortunately exercise stamina diminishes in many people as they grow older
experts says that exercise keeps our body and brain alert however age could have an impact on it
the american medical association says that several health problems can be caused by lack of exercise
dr patricia pellikka of the mayo clinic says that aging is a major cause of disability and slow performance of the body
dr pellikka teaches medicine at the mayo clinic
she headed a study on heart disease in older people and human capabilities for exercising
the doctors team used high frequency waves to assess the performance of the heart
measuring the pumping of blood by the heart its contraction and relaxation phase
the experts focused on the left part of the heart which is the main organ for pumping blood
they learned that with aging deficiencies occur in the relaxation phase of the heart
pellikka says older people with problems in the relaxation phase had more pronounced problems with their capacity to exercise
dr garwin kein was part of the study
he said that they were surprised to see the dramatic effect this has and that it clarifies the extent to which exercise deficiency is linked to relaxation of heart
sometimes blood pressure becomes a cause of deficiencies in the heart process and heart disease
if doctors and patients worked together on heart deficiencies they could reap the benefits of exercise in spite of aging
this study has appeared in the journal of the american medical association
no risk of immediate war with pakistan indian army chief
indian army chief general deepak kapoor said that there was no possibility of immediate war with pakistan however the army is always prepared to defend the country and protect its interests
general kapoor alleged that despite international pressure on pakistan and assurances following the mumbai attacks terrorist networks are not only present on pakistani soil but active as well
he said this while talking to reporters in srinagar
the indian army chief was on a oneday visit to kashmir valley to assess the overall security situation in indianheld kashmir and the preparedness of the armed forces
he was asked to comment on the media reports that pakistan has spurned indian evidence concerning the mumbai attacks
general kapoor said that political leadership makes decisions dealing with matters related to war or peace
referring to the alleged presence of terrorist infrastructure on pakistani soil he said that india would confront any elements that are determined to disturb the peace and weaken india
he said that about 700800 militants are present in indianheld kashmir of which 50 per cent are foreigners
general deepak kapoor said that with the change in weather infiltration from pakistan and its part of kashmir could increase however india has increased monitoring on the border
he rejected the possibility of a reduction in indian troop presence in indianheld kashmir saying that national security cannot be compromised
may the world say good things and may obama be good for the world
although there is no such hope however let us watch how far pakus relations shift in our favour as a result of this change
let also watch what barak (obama) who himself is a realization of martin luther kings dream does for the world
for obama who has the word hussein as part of his name taking the oath as president of the united states is historically important at the same time it is also a tough test
not only for his race but also for all of those who supported him
additionally it will be a test for the white majority as it is not easy for them in their hearts to accept being ruled by a black man
here south asians and muslims in particular who have attached hopes to him should remember that he has been elected as the us president and on his part obama should remember that the us president is practically the president of the world
the united states will today have in its 40th president a person who comes from a race whose members were brought to the us as slaves and who greatly contributed to the development of the country which is today counted as the most powerful nation a member of the same raciallyvictimized community is poised to become the next us president
many people have attached a great deal of hope to this person
his fans should not have unrealistic expectations for him
even if obama only succeeds in minimizing the race and religionbased discrimination to some extent it should be counted as a victory for his supporters
what impact will this change have on south asia can a meaningful change in us foreign policy be expected in this regard
what impact will this change have on pakus relations
mister it does not matter who the person is obama or someone else for it is the rich strong and influential jewish lobby alone that shapes the policy toward the world and the nature of relations
as far as pakistan is concerned the critical stand of india israel and even the us is quite clear regarding the mumbai attacks that took place recently
for a long time after the creation of pakistan the governor of swat looked after all of the administrative affairs of swat he had his regular army and independent law
he had handed over the administration of swat to the pakistani government under an accord
however it is a matter of regret that our governments have treated swat like a stepmother
as of the end of the governance of swats governor the number of schools never increased there
also no interest was taken in its development and prosperity
the number of girls who were attending school in recent times was several times lower than the number who used to study in the past
local taliban continue to target educational institutions in pakistans frontier province
most of the schools destroyed are in the swat district among them most are girls schools
moreover the taliban have declared a ban on girls education in swat
as a result thousands of students both boys and girls are being deprived of education
in your opinion what is talibans intention behind depriving girls of education
why did the government fail until now to curb these illegal activities
in your opinion what should the government do
the question that should be asked is what benefits the isi and the pakistani agencies will reap
the people of swat have now understood this game which is about serving the taliban not killing them otherwise how could five persons have been killed in one night in a state of curfew how could people could have been hanged in the main street of the city after being butchered
since the government failed to implement its law in swat then how it can succeed in preventing these illegal actions
the question is that while the government agencies possess everything from armed forces modern firearms and modern technology to spy systems why cant these outnumbered taliban be controlled
the answer is that they are supported by some hidden power as neither are their weapons turned over nor are they caught
in a nutshell the taliban are facilitating the actions of a global imperial power through their evil deeds
fifteen years ago there was war in afghanistan
the taliban were controlled by the isi while the rival northern alliance was supported by russia india and iran
all of a sudden the situation changed and all of the actions of the taliban became clear
also the isi was offered dollars by the us hence the friend turned to foe
in the current situation the war is still going on but the supporters in pakistan are the same iran india and russia
a person keeps committing mistakes as long as he fails to distinguish between what is right and what is wrong
for example if a thief realizes that theft is a bad habit and a curse and that it brings punishment and the wrath of god then this realization will serve as an effective deterrent for him and he will not proceed with his plan of theft
similarly as long as israel fails to realize that it is doing wrong by killing innocent people and that it will be punished for doing so it will continue to shed the blood of innocents in gaza
greetings
the question is are war armed struggle or terrorism solutions to the problems
if not then what is the useful prescription that may potentially lead to solving the problem
it is correct that war and the path of violence do not solve problems on the contrary they further complicate them
in order for their movements to be successful palestine afghanistan and iraq should opt for the model implemented by nelson mandela in south africa
morals political struggle and jihad against oneself should be given more of a chance than armed struggle
the participation of kashmiris in the election process is a reflection of the acceptance of this point
israeli offensives targeting gaza have entered the third phase of three in a row the death toll has reached 1000
despite global diplomatic efforts the war could not yet be stopped
according to an estimate about ninety thousand palestinians have left their homes for safe places as of now since the attacks started on december 27
on the other hand relief agencies have accused israel of not caring for palestinian childrens safety saying a complete generation of palestinian children will suffer from psychological and emotional problems

taliban should be given a chance

awake if the taliban walk the path of real jihad then who will butcher the innocent
who will burn girls schools
who will commit abduction in order to demand ransom and after not getting the ransoms who will murder the abducted people and hang their dead bodies on trees labeling them as american spies
the taliban have done far more harm to islam than any religion or nation ever has
pusthon ror
kohat pakistan
you will see how much israels respected father the us will be hurt if the entire muslim world only threatens to attack israel
the issue of the immediate end to the war will not only be talked about but will actually be stopped
but sadly from where will our muslim rulers get the courage to do so
it would be better if somebody would suggest to ahmadinejad to take the initiative as his courage is much appreciated on the bbc forum
the responsibility of establishing peace and human rights does not fall on the arabs or muslims of the world alone rather it is the duty of the nations of the world to raise a voice against injustice
this dreadful incident is the worst of the sins bush has yet committed
the us administration has given israel the green light to do whatever it wishes just as government institutions in india and pakistan freely indulge in the worst form of corruption before june 30 ie before the end of the fiscal year each year
on one hand the us says that efforts will be made to stop the war
on the other the united nations has been passing resolution after resolution however both have done nothing practically on the ground a matter that sends only one signal that the united nations is also prepared to ruin muslims
all muslim countries should withdraw their membership from the united nations immediately and should form a global body of their own
we have several examples where the us and the united nations make promises and pass resolutions but muslims just continue to suffer
what is the use of these comments which the bbc will never publish
where have all the rules of journalism been buried the bbc becomes biased when innocent muslims are killed
however it claims to be the champion of truth
it does not even publish the comments let alone say something on its own
the only difference between you and the jews is that they call themselves jews and kill muslims while you live among muslims call yourselves muslims and (kill) muslims
syja786
a particular community is being targeted in the bbc forums sometimes in the guise of suicide attacks and at other times in the guise of terrorism in india
the favorite expression of the people making these antiislam comments is extremism
but the question is whos the real extremist that can more easily be determined from the comments mentioned above which label writing against iran as disloyal
when will we muslims realize that dajjal (an evil figure in islamic eschatology) cannot be fought with the sword
the israeli bombings targeting unarmed people are making us shed tears of blood what else can we do
but the main fault lies in the acts of corruption and killing that we call jihad thus damaging the image of islam
when the majority of palestinians have already recognized israel what is the use of hamass firing rockets or carrying out suicide attacks against israel
the behaviour of both sides is inhumane
again we notice that the us and the united nations are playing a role that supports the injustices perpetrated by israel
may allah unite the muslim ummah amen
may they (muslim ummah) think about giving a prize for carrying out the difficult task of combating terrorism to the real terrorists because they are the ones who are doing the real job
otherwise is terrorism of such a magnitude possible without the backing of some big leader everybody knows who stands behind it (terrorism)
in simple words they may be termed as behaving like big brother
the powerful strikes the weak and at the same time doesnt allow him to weep
arab rulers are giving money and medicine for the injured and burial supplies for the dead
people are asking what should be done about israeli offensives
in fact the problem is that the leaders of muslim countries including the saudi rulers are sleeping they neither have an army nor a defense plan they believe they have fulfilled their duties by merely donating relief materials
they should take practical measures against israel immediately
for example by imposing an oil embargo on european countries and america
greetings to all brothers and sisters
i feel that advising hamas at this critical juncture to give up its struggle in the name of peace is synonymous with injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands of orphans and to neutralize their efforts
if israel and its supports have reached the height of pharohism then a moses will emerge in their homes soon as this is the rule of nature american and israeli actions are nurturing suicide bombers among muslims
this is a fact that people obsessed with power cannot understand
abu abdullah pakistan
hamas and israel should now enter into reconciliation in order to end the cycle of bloodshed
mohammad sarfraz paris france
rightly said
let us suppose that hamas is one hundred percent correct and seeks to earn gods favor by fighting a holy war against injustice nevertheless they must know at the very least that if their holy acts contribute to making many families homeless then what is the use of such holy acts
loving human beings is part of the belief of those who claim they love god his prophet and their religion
its as if allah has ordered the cleansing of all ahlekitab (believers in divine books) other than muslims from the face of the earth
najeebur rahman saeko lahore pakitan
no it has not been ordered to cleanse them but rather to invite them (to islam)
however it has been ordered to wage jihad against those who hatch conspiracies against the religion
such people should be fought until they stop hatching conspiracies though in a manner that is never careless
brothers the fate of the killers of innocent children is destruction
however i would like to point out that the israelis had no place to live in the past today there are so powerful that they dont listen to anyone in the world the reason is that they are united and one
they have no sects like shia or sunni they are all jews they have made all means of development and progress in all fields
in contrast what is the condition of the 55 islamic countries
they are backward in all spheres now they are so helpless that enemies are killing them and they are waiting for their death
the need of the hour is that all muslim countries must unite to work out a strategy against israel
feroz magsi jhang pakistan
there is no better strategy than to recognize israel and learn from it the modern sciences and techniques of progress and development and let the world live in peace
muslims have lots of lands and means
they need to utilize them properly
the most painful aspect is the lack of unity between hamas and fatah
great leaders like yasser arafat and sheikh yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken the only courageous people of the region who have been fighting a holy war (jihad) for the sake of the al aqsa mosque it was impossible to achieve this goal without getting yasin and arafat out of the way
the world has since witnessed how palestine has been disintegrating after the death of these two leaders
and the jewish lobby has really been tightening its grip
in 1974 the pakistani prime minister enjoyed such stature on the global stage that he was able to bring all muslim leaders under one roof with one hundred percent attendance
today on its 81st anniversary isnt it a very difficult task for the people of this nation to undertake to remain united
and to achieve the incomplete mission of establishing an islamic commonwealth addressing the differences among muslims
there is a jinn who has been haunting palestine for half a century now
this jinn has many mouths
sometimes this jinn criticizes himself speaking through one of his mouths thus he diverts the worlds attention and resists global pressure
this same jinn has been eating humans with his other mouths in iraq afghanistan iran and pakistan
this jinn is most afraid of islam as he is well aware that he will be thrown out only by islam and practicing faithful muslims history tells us that islam has brought big tyrants to the right path
israeli warplanes bombings missile attacks going on since december 27
these attacks have now claimed the lives of over 300 palestinians
after the airstrikes israeli tanks and armored vehicles have now reached the gaza borders to launch ground operations
the united nations security council has urged both israel and the palestinian authority through a resolution unanimously adopted in its emergency session to stop the violent operations immediately
however israeli officials say that they will continue their operations inside gaza until they make sure that no more rocket attacks against israel will be carried out
in your opinion do you believe it is correct on the part of israel to say that this offensive is an attempt to defend israels security
is the international community playing its role in this situation
is this offensive indirectly linked to the upcoming elections in israel
can any improvement in the situation in the middle east be expected after americas newlyelected president barack obama takes office

mere shedding of tears will never help
mere prayers will never solve the problem (nawab zada nasrullah khan)
the bbc always looks for such comments in order to publish them
at the end of the day it has to maintain its unbiased image
bbc news coverage is generally true but the main issue is the style of the presentation
such as what news should be highlighted and what should not
etc etc
zaheer chughtai
pakistani electronic and print media and particularly a few urdu newspapers and columnists have now mastered this art they are obsessed with the coverage of extremism and terrorism
where is the united nations which talks about peace and human rights muslims are subjugated to the worst form of injustice it only urges hamas to stop attacks for how long will this policy of double standards be pursued
why are injustices against muslims perpetrated if the us stops backing the jews then they will live in humiliation as allah has said they can never lead a life of respect and dignity americans stop backing them and you will see what kind of life they live
the socalled advocates of justice and those committing the acts of murder and destruction in the name of peace should understand well that peace can only be established by delivering justice in the world not by perpetrating injustice and killing human beings
if killing was the only way to cleanse a particular community and to achieve the desired goals then after hitlers holocaust it would have been impossible for the jews to remain in existence and to achieve the progress they have actually made
according to the poet
injustice is injustice after all when it increases it comes to an end
blood is blood after all when it runs on the ground it becomes hard
who can say what terrorism is and how it will be told
doesnt all of this fall under the category of terrorism why does everyone only feel his own pain
are others not human beings or has the blood of muslims alone become so cheap was the blood of so many innocent people not red
why do no messages of condolence come from any corner
i watched the operations after the mumbai attacks as if my own house was engulfed with fire because the pain of human beings cant be ignored does no one feel this pain all muslims should be united and speak in one voice
i cant find the words to express my condemnation of this scene of dead bodies helpless injured people and killed innocents all lying in the street
you cant keep from shedding tears after seeing the helplessness of muslims on the one hand when people are killed in india the whole world condemns pakistan and pushes it to carry out operations or to be ready for operations against it
but on the other israel is openly cleansing itself of muslims and the whole world is keeping silent it cant be tolerated
gods response may come late but he is not in the dark
as long as america is there it is a joke to say that israels security is in danger
as far as the elections are concerned there is no doubt that the ruling class particularly in israel carries out such operations in order to win peoples support regarding barak obama history is witness to the fact that no american ruler has ever gone nor will one ever go against the established policy regardless of whether the ruler is black or white
the ongoing discussions on the forum reflect the fact that everyone is feeling the pain of benazirs death however her faults as a politician cannot be overlooked
it should be discussed whether or not benazir sacrificed her life for the sake of democracy or in pursuit of power
if democracy was so dear to her then why did she leave the people under musharrafs dictatorship for 10 years until the american clearance and deal happened
benazir did not return to pakistan at the time when the people who were reeling under the dictatorship needed her most unfortunately she returned to pakistan only when the cases against her were cleared and she was assured of power
nobody says anything about the allegations and criticisms that are made about the historical person
sana khan
some things are overlooked because nothing can be done about them

sirmaam perhaps you have studied the history not only in pakistan but in four friendly countries and seven other countries perhaps you will agree with mr saikos opinion

though the wheat plant stands in water its shadow cant be green
britain never let them unite it created a hindumuslim dispute which was promoted by sir sayyad
saiko
how cruel our people are they blindly praise themselves and their party however nobody comes forward to reply to the criticisms and allegations made against every intellectual history has ever known
we have achieved much progress
sana khan
some things are overlooked because nothing can be done about them the same as an ass cant be counted among literates merely because books are loaded over it
in the aftermath of the mumbai attacks the pakistaniindian dialogue has come to a standstill however pakistan and india should continue these talks
if they talk about war it will cost human lives on both sides
india says the person who was caught during the mumbai attacks is a pakistani citizen and that he wrote a letter in urdu and sent it to pakistan however when india had captured him india had said he was a senior engineer later on india said he had passed only fourth standard these statements need to be scrutinized
first of all merry christmas to mr bhana and all of our christian friends on the forum
forum friends greetings to mr saiko mr a raza sister sana sister shahida akram and everybody
we dont want the fires of war but flowers of peace
war in itself is a problem
how can war solve problems
fire and blood will deliver today
hunger and necessity will deliver tomorrow
so oh the wise men
it is better if war does not occur
it is better if the candle keeps
giving light to your house and ours
relations between india and the us have now become very deep india knows for sure that the us will cheat pakistan openly whenever it needs to do so
this is the past history of the us
if india attacks the us will achieve its goals while india will bear the expenses
pakistan should openly declare that we will not be the first to start war however in the case of aggression we will not talk about peace and ending war until india is completely destroyed or occupied even though we ourselves will be destroyed in the process
this is the history of islam
pakistans people and army have sent the message the wanted even before this resolution
in reaction to the mumbai attacks india has been trying to reap the unusual diplomatic and military benefits while projecting itself as a victim it has acted wisely in exploiting these attacks thats why the global pressure on pakistan has now decreased despite strong global reaction initially
without taking the note of the unnecessary indian hype the united nations has expressed its satisfaction over the pakistani efforts the interpol chief has also praised these efforts such international praise is the side effect of indias unnecessary diplomacy
indisputably this is a very inhumane act
the question is where was the pakistani army and what was it doing when thousands of taliban attacked peer samiullahs village
shouldnt the army be held accountable for what they did during the oneyear period they spent there
how many taliban are killed with the mortars and tank artillery they fire by the thousands on a daily basis
and stop this fake operation
one day the united nations will pass a resolution regarding military intervention in pakistan the same as it has done against jamatual dawah
first of all our extremists and their supporters themselves are providing all the evidence and justification for actions against them it is quite possible that once such a resolution is proposed not a single voice in the un will be on our side
supposedly if the adoption of such a resolution is delayed some power like the usa will unilaterally attack it
i dont know what peer samiullah was like as a person nor do i know about his achievements
perhaps he was not a revolutionary
even though the dead bodies of comrade che goera nawab akbar khan bugti dr najeebullah and thousands of revolutionaries were handled with disrespect by their enemies
they are immortal even after their death
but the case here is different an international game is being played here people are being terrorized so that they can be controlled
and in order to justify remaining in power
this action by islamists in the name of religion is deplorable
the supporters of these extremists see the injustices perpetrated by the us however they ignore their own inhumane actions without expressing any remorse instead they merely describe them as tribal traditions
a man of reason cannot justify such inhumane actions which are sometimes carried out in the guise of tribal traditions and at other times carried out in the name of islam
i think my army has an understanding with them
because it is understandable that it may take time for the army to move there and nab them but how can they manage to flee even if the army is present there
are they brave enough to kidnap 5070 people the army merely keeps watching as a spectator
both kidnappers and army men are human beings
it is quite clear that there is something else going on behind the scenes
since the time of the dictator ziaul haq who was the real dictator mullahism has been reminding us about different types of punishments and telling wise stories in the name of religion creating an atmosphere of terror instead they should have highlighted qualities of god such as mercy incidents like hanging dead bodies (on trees) and their literature like the book titled what will happen after death also create a sense of terror and fear
these people have been exploiting terror as a means of achieving status for themselves in this world
mullahs
you have cautioned others about hell fire
i feel strange when it is said that this is not the work of a muslim person
we dont know about our own history or we hide the fact intentionally
were the attacks on medina by yazeeds army and the incident in karbala carried out by indians and jews
without admitting the facts motives have never been addressed
bbc stop pursuing your policy of using a double standard
the headline which reads hurling shoe at bush permissible or not is much better than this topic
it should be there
tahir chowdhary japan
my dear for shame you are talking about box office while the dead body of a person was taken out of his grave and hung on a pole because he had raised his voice against injustice
the success of operation sheredil and operation lion heart from across the border depends on public opinion
this initiative has been undertaken by american and pakistani agencies peer saheb has fallen prey to this conspiracy
all comments in this forum will now focus on opposing the taliban because intelligence people have now joined the taliban and are taking steps that may change public opinion
the dead body kept hanging for a whole day i have just one question to ask where was the army what were the soldiers doing is their only job to target the common man their statements read as taliban positions bombed 2 children their mother killed
didnt they know about that place
or they were merely watching like spectators
we request humbly and with folded hands that this game be stopped for gods sake
there is a ruler (god) above you
it does not matter whether the question asked by the bbc is reasonable or not however the low standard of the comments is regrettable for example nobody asked what 30000 army men were doing in swat
while the dead bodies of those helping the army and fighting the taliban were hanging on poles
let alone what the pakistani army did to the people of swat however even the media including the bbc kept the world in the dark with regard to the real facts in doing so they did not do the right thing
the pakistani army is staging a drama
every child in swat would say that it is a bloody one
stop this drama for gods sake
the taliban have destroyed the image of muslims
if muslims all over the world had not accepted them as muslims they would not have found a foothold anywhere
those who have no shame and cant work to earn a living take to guns and join their group
for shame
neither any religion nor any family tradition allows for it
all media outlets including the bbc comment about the taliban and tribes
but none of them is aware of the real situation only we know what the real situation is because we are tribal people
in short this is a game being played by the cia raw mossad and our isi there is neither any taliban nor any tribal these are bad elements created by these agencies and they are giving a bad name to islam taliban madrassas pashtuns tribes and tribal traditions
this action has made all muslims feel ashamed
i greet the leader of mqm altaf hussain and the leader of anp and ppp who speak out against this cancer ie against the taliban
this cancer was created by ziaul haq he is no more but he has destroyed pakistan too
however i am optimistic that the current leadership will be able to treat this cancer
after the mumbai attacks india said pakistani extremists were behind the attacks
pakistan rejected these allegations saying it would extend all possible assistance to india to investigate the attacks
on its part india said it had submitted a list to pakistan containing the names of suspected extremists wanted by india
pakistan said that maulana masood azhar one of the individuals on the list was not under arrest and that the pakistani government had no information about him
pakistani president asif ali zardari had already rejected the notion that western intelligence agencies and the indian government had provided pakistan with evidences related to the mumbai attacks
regarding ajmal kasab president zardari said it was not yet proved that he was a pakistani
meanwhile prime minster manmohan singh warned pakistan that indias relations with it could not be improved as long as the pakistani territories were being used for terrorism
in the latest development indias cricket team has cancelled its tour to pakistan
should these political developments have an impact on sports
what do you think about the future of pakindia relations
no one will break pakistan neither america nor india
pakistan will be broken only by pakistanis
what can you expect after so much regionalism communalism and mullaism
by the way even jinnah hadnt treated indian muslims in a nice fashion time has proved it
yasmin chicago
madam if jinnahs dream was realized and his programs properly followed pakistan never would have seen such cancers like regionalism communalism and mullaism or at the very least indian muslims would not have been treated badly
it is our fault that we could not produce a leader of that stature
if we cant respect our heroes then who will
there is plenty of talent here
god knows when will they understand and this region will learn to become united and flourish
the mullahs pandits taliban shiv sena rss etc present in both countries are against peace
and the dajjali powers do not wish to see this region progress in peace that is why these countries are made to dance to their tune
can you imagine where pakistan india and china could stand in the world with peace in the region
it is allahs wrath on pakistan that thieves dacoits and thugs have become the leaders of the community
allah willing no harm should come to our country pakistan amen
but if you open your eyes and analyze the situation and reality on the ground you will see how far america has reached
apart from that even the internal situation is not very encouraging the situations on the border and in balochistan sindh and karachi are clearly laid out before you
in such situations the country needs a leader who can unite all of us into a community
may allah bless us all
i think one last war is inevitable
enough is enough
now a decisive battle should be fought
these hypocritical bilateral talks will not solve the problem
nor will we get any relief from these smalltime terrorist activities in our countries
europe was relieved of it but not before it had to fight the last world war
if it were not for the last world war those countries would still be quarreling like india and pakistan
almost all of our political parties agree to the fact that terrorism and communalism should end in the country
but our army leadership does not seem to be very sincere about it on the one hand america and europe have promised a helping hand in the battle against terrorism while on the other hand they even help the taliban secretly
we should ponder it and decide our path and follow it thanks
there is no doubt that most of the members of jamatuddawa are comprised of lashkaretaiba cadets who joined the newly formed jamatuddawa after the pakistani government banned lashkaretaiba
however even though these cadets prefer social work under strong pressure from india the united nations also banned the group and the pakistani government initiated crackdowns against them
i think these jihadi groups should leave religious fundamentalism alone and start focusing more on religious and charitable activities the sooner the better
pakistans terrorist outfits which have recruited criminals in the name of jihad they and the bigwigs of these mullahs are the very same people who would call pakistan a land of impurity and so forth
now they are leaving no stone unturned to destroy pakistan
forget about muslim they are not even fit to be called a human being actually
the country will remain in danger until we rid pakistan of these miscreants
does it still require more thinking to ban these rioters
the violent mullahs whose only job is to kill will not get a place in this world
my heart is breaking at this news
what kind of a world is this where a man who breathes in the name of islam cant live in this world peacefully
nonmuslims can kill muslims but if a muslim even tries to exact revenge the entire nonmuslim world unites with our treacherous rulers and behaves like they are behaving with our great leader hafiz saeed with righteous muslim brethren
because of the mumbai terrorist attacks indian
pakistani relations have soured and the relationship which has become smoother in recent years has been derailed once again
india has always blamed armed and unarmed groups operating in pakistan
and conditions the normalization of relations between the two countries on taking action against these groups
meanwhile indian security organizations have directly blamed lashkaretaiba for the mumbai attacks
jamatuddawas name resurfaces every now and then
this is not the first time that the relationship between the two countries has soured because of a terrorist attack
in december 2001 after the attack on the indian parliament the two countries were on the brink of war
after that in 2002 lashkaretaiba was banned and put on the list of terror groups
now there is a demand to ban jamatuddawa regarding which security analysts are saying that lashkaretaiba has been putting on a new face for some time now
what do you think should these groups be banned
should pakistan take action against terror groups functioning on its soil
will a ban of jamatuddawa break the deadlock between india
and pakistan and is it necessary to ban armed groups in order to achieve a permanent peace between the two countries
the united nations (un) security council has banned jamatuddawa but what evidence do they have against it to ban it so fast
dont you think the security council always acts with urgency against muslims
thats what we call throwing out a red herring
if you look closely you will find that india has become a failed state
whose intelligence army and other security organizations are failed organizations that could not control a few terrorists for 72 hours and on top of that india is accusing pakistan thus conning the world
if a nonbeliever got killed the whole world listen to the outcry why this double standard
to the only apolitical religious social organisation
furqaan farooque faislabad
islam flourished because our prophet (pbuh) auliya karaam and sufis showered love and respect on the people
muslims also had progressed in all fields
but when this beautiful religion was hijacked by mullahs differences between believers and nonbelievers started to emerge and new chapters of riots and violence have started which the world has not seen before
salaam do it but do it on your own
not under pressure from america
if india has a problem let it produce evidence
why dont they provide it
and why do they blame us for everything
there are terrorist outfits and organizations even in india why dont they ban them
are we the only terrorists in the world
what is it that india is doing in kashmir
how will you explain what israel is doing
actually we are the first islamic nuclear state that is the main conflict
pakistan is now in the last phase
kamran hasan abu dhabi
whatever you say touches my heart and the situation also indicates that
now american magazines are publishing new pakistani maps with much fanfare and these restrictions seem to be a part of it
america is capturing pakistan not slowly but at high speed
as a nation if we do not show unity then remember if bangladesh could be created so could many other such things
terrorist attacks are condemnable be they in a mumbai hotel or islamabads marriott hotel or in palestine
all such terrorists should be finished whether they are pakistanis indians americans or israelis
now the question is why the whole world along with pakistan officials is quiet about the routine attacks in pakistan which are killing hundreds of people
is the attack on the marriott hotel not the handiwork of terrorists
then why
oh i would give my life for internal minister rahman malik saheb masha allah he has become so gutsy and brave
not only this according to the bbc mr malik had rejected this impression with complete severity that terrorists are not being arrested on anyones insistence (order)
bhai subhan allah
you are talented or not or say that you dont want it
whose battle are we pakistan fighting
and why not we also have our benefits to be protected and we will do so at any cost
no one has a right to interfere in someones internal affairs
apparently this is no time of colonization
if people expect justice or if this alliance insists on implementing the rule of law respecting democratic institutions and not helping any dictator or an army only then there will be peace in the third world including pakistan and probably this will not be acceptable to the alliance
as it is pakistan is busy fulfilling the objectives of america and europe
this happens when the majority of pakistan population is against it
and this gives air to conflicting feelings
if america and its allies believe in democracy then they should denounce the colonizing pattern and immediately leave this region
pakistan has the capacity to arm or disarm itself
security forces raided an alleged camp of banned group lashkaretaiba in pakistanoccupied kashmir
pakistan is under immense pressure to act against fundamentalist organizations after the mumbai terror attacks
india believes that lashkaretaiba is behind the mumbai attacks
she said that the mumbai attackers had definitely used pakistani soil
meanwhile officials in peshawar said that unidentified armed individuals attacked trucks that were carrying supplies for allied forces deployed in afghanistan fifty trucks were damaged
in peshawar this is the second attack in the past 48 hours on nato and american supply trucks
in the meantime pakistan attacked an alleged camp run by the banned group lashkaretaiba earlier an effort was made to disarm the armed groups of karachi tribals compensation was offered to those who surrendered and a promise was made that no action would be taken against them
the question is whether or not pakistan wants to do it
does pakistan have the capability to do it
what do you say

please note that due to an overabundance of feedback only letters in urdu will be accepted
(press altshift on the onscreen keyboard to select urdu)
i have only one question to the flagbearers of humanity
if you kill their children would they bring garlands to you this is impossible
and my question to you is right from islamic teachings to that of western and eastern religions no logic argument or philosophy can justify the killings of innocent people including namazis laborers and poor workers by american assault
and if your answer is negative then you should check on your point of view you are required to reform
people were armed at that point in time it was believed that russia could move into pakistan after afghanistan therefore people were armed
now when there is a serious concern that america could attack pakistan through afghanistan which was time and again expressed by the currentamerican president during his election campaign why should we disarm them
only because america should not face a backlash from them after defeating india and pakistan
but if someone is involved in destructive activities pakistan should deal with them in a tough manner
by being on lashkaretaibas side the government of pakistan had proved india right that pakistan is involved in this this is very disappointing
najeeburrehman saiko lahore pakistan
even if we accept that lashkaretaiba was involved it is not right to blame the pakistan government for that
and there is also a question whether these terrorists were not supported by some government or nongovernment recruits of india or not
are terrorists only born in pakistan and not in india and other parts of the world
as far as lashkaretaiba is concerned it has no connection in the recent terror attacks
it is to be remembered that hafiz saeed was the first jihadi leader who declared talibans activities as a fitnah
i firmly believe that the tumult of the taliban is an essential element of american plans and therefore it is necessary to remove all such people and organizations from the way who in any capacity can challenge the authority of the taliban
to finish this movement started by americansaudi funding we will only have to request them to clean this filth which has poisoned our society
we have to resist against them and ask as to under which moral ground america and saudi arabia had supplied dangerous weapons so called jihadis literature and a culture of hatred to our country which had opened human butchery in our country
after india threatened to attack pakistan declared its intention to remove its army from its afghan border to tackle the current issue with india and taliban declared that they will look after the afghan border america was shattered and left no one stone unturned to ensure that india should not attack pakistan
this has harmed americas reputation in the region
although india has not threatened to attack nor does it have the courage to do it
talibans attack on american supplies proved fatal even for them
it is proved that without the support of the pakistan army and the government of pakistan america is nothing
the financial business hub of karachi pakistan is the dubai of all the backward regions
millions of people come here and no one leaves emptyhanded but after lawlessness prevailed in the border areas karachi has become the focal point for all
now they are bent on hijacking the city
for the first time pathans are called pakhtoons and people of one city are lined up against the others whereas harmony is the need of the hour
one solution to the problem is that urduspeaking people should learn pashtu and vice versa or if all the people should learn english all the better
you will definitely see it as a ridiculous proposal but dont you think the reason for violence is equally ridiculous
can language be the reason for violence
zaheer chughtai
sir as a child i made this suggestion many times to my friends who hailed from different religious and language groups but they would always laugh at me
at that point in time language and religionbased hatred was just growing it was not as violent and strong as it is today
i dont understand what is happening and why
is it an indication of insurrection
innocent people are being killed for things not their fault
the reasons are before everyone those who want to break pakistan only they are active whoever is doing all this has no religion and belongs to no country
whether it is karachi or mumbai the house caught fire from its own lamp
whichever government comes along it seems to be only interested in changing names for popularity for example airports roads buildings all are named after benazeer
whatever is happening in karachi and pakistan could it be called benazeer
while the mumbai terror attack is on the ascendancy a failed attempt by raw to incite a languagebased riot shows that the political elements working on behalf of raw are retired from the job
the blood of innocent pashtuspeaking laborers and indian threats awakened the sentiment of pakistanism from karachi to khaibar
a full and similar reaction of patriotism from all political religious linguistic and national parties had on the one hand taught india the etiquette of diplomacy and at the same time it provided american strategists one more chance to think
the alliance and the anp are responsible for the bad situation in karachi and the administration is also being partial in this matter
the administration could control the situation in one hour but it has been ignored and provoked intentionally
there is political pressure on police and rangers because of which they avoid taking action
unity is just a part of speeches political parties should work for the benefit of common people rather than for their own good
these situations will keep surfacing until there is political pressure on the administration
according to me these people are the biggest terrorists
and certainly there are external powers behind it but we are not aware who they are
but the contradiction is if such a situation occurs in a border area the government leaves no stone unturned to curb it but if the same happens in a city and not a border area the government looks helpless
the government should start its operations here and save one of the biggest and important cities of the country
otherwise pakistan will face a huge financial crisis
even bbc urdu is not writing the truth out of fear not to mention pakistani media
the entire truth is available on bbc english
one solution to the problem is that the urduspeaking people should learn pashtu or vice versa or everyone should learn english that is far better
you can very well take it as a ridiculous suggestion but dont you think that the reason for the clash is even more ridiculous
should language be a reason for violence
at last there is one more story printed on the walls of karachi city which the citizens have been expecting for some time now
whatever one can do without leaving any stone unturned whatever has happened here in last four days only 50 was covered by the media
we have been awake for the last three nights and are still in fear
killers of cobblers who vacate hotels and groundnut sellers
the robbers of highways and those who cut ears of innocent people are unaware of allahs anger which will for sure come to them
what do think what are the reasons for this sudden violence
(bbc)
we dont need to get into indias shattering incident of killings in mumbai the easy and plain reason is that this violence happened unconsciously and because of a stir in the blood
it is evident that if someone challenges a father his sons blood will definitely boil he would lose control for sure
the blood of liyaqat ali khan and many martyrs belong to that area but to clear saiko sahebs doubt i am posting a couplet for him
we will also repeat the traditions of our ancestors
we built it by giving life we will save it by doing the same
faizan tauseef siddiqui
it is very disappointing that the whole of the country is at stake and we are battling against each other
it is a request to siddiqui saheb that if
he sees liyaqat ali khan someday then he will know that he hailed from one of the respectable punjabi families of karnal punab province
what he did for the muhajirs was the reason why muhajirs accepted him as their own
every action has a reaction
you can bear it if it is personal
ajaz awan
sir before you gather opinion makers i would like to say to you that you can see open evidence of real mischief on the walls of karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters
we have been suffering both kinds of mischief
these rascals have not even left pakistan and the father of pakistan they never faced any reaction of any type
on the contrary they are creating problems for pakistan
there was once a muslim league (n) it also has documented an 18th amendment and given it to the peoples party
earlier the mqm and the muslim league (q) had submitted an 18th amendment bill in the national assembly and senate
until now it seems that the 18th amendment is only a political gimmick and no one is sincere in getting it passed
this is the reason why no one has created any uproar about this bill in the assembly or the senate floor to pressure the house to get this bill passed
it seems that by only submitting the amendment bill they cleared the air and can say that they had submitted the amendment but the government had not acted on it
the mqm is an ally of the government the muslim league (n) is supporting it from behind and the muslim league (q) is the party which will get the 17th amendment passed then how it is possible that these parties are sincere about abolishing the 17th amendment
this is just eyewash
as it is the peoples party is not in a hurry to abolish the 17th amendment
how can one think of getting his own hands chopped off
the 17th amendment cannot be abolished as long as zardari is there
this is what majority of us said in a survey and this only is true
if the 17th amendment had been abolished zardari would have never become president
now he is more powerful than pervez musharraf because he is not only the president but also the chairman of peoples party
as long as he is the president the 17th amendment will remain intact
to abolish the 17th amendment political parties will have to remove president zardari from the presidential house first
neither the mqm nor other parties wants it
most of our ancestors belonged to the labor class
and in our childhood when we used to see our uncles and maternal uncles selling things on handcarts we would pray to allah to save us from physical labor
to save us from that we wrote a letter to the editor of daily imroz and asked as to what one should do after metric to be saved from physical labor
the editor replied that we should become a doctor or an engineer and suggested a few subjects
as it is we were interested in engineering and we passed our metric exams in technical drawing not biology
but when we went to take admission in fsc my elder brother forced us to take admission in medical fsc and become a doctor
we hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldnt understand we exchanged it for mathematics
that means fear from physical labor had made us engineers and now we are in a much better position in our family and we thank allah for that
we realized this while we were laying a carpet in our old house with our two young sons
we said if it is true then study hard like us and keep away from physical labor
the son said i am studying and will study but i cannot do this work
we finished that work somehow in three hours
it is meant to say that if a man decides his destination no matter what comes his way no one can stop him from reaching there
yes if you dont know what to do then only allah can save you
it is said that one should not speak ill of the dead but what could one do when only bad things are seen on the first anniversary of the death of benazeer
on the one hand benazeer had arranged the list of sikhs who were fighting for their freedom in india and suppressed their movement and on the other hand she had given india a chance after suppressing the punjab movement in order to concentrate on kashmir
the rift of power between benazeer and nawaz shareef is a part of history that has pushed the country many years back
during her banishment benazeer continued to give statements against kashmir and the nuclear program
benazeer had dealt with general musharraf dishonoring his agreement with nawaz shareef in london
benazeer during his tenure allowed her husband to earn much money this has earned him the name of mr ten percent
her brother was killed when she was in power and his assassins are still at large
being a woman benazeer never raised her voice about womens rights
the way benazeer created her politics on her fathers dead body in the same way her widower husband is playing politics on her dead body
benazeer came to power twice but she could not arrest the political killers of her father and could not even initiate a case against them
thirtyseven years had passed when east pakistan broke from us and look at the apathy of our people and leaders that no one even feels sad about it and no one is beating his chest over a mistake of our own
we should have remembered december 16 as an example and made sure that such things dont happen again
on that day we could send messages of prosperity to the people of bangladesh and try again to bring them closer
rulers would open mehmoodurrahmans files and look into the reasons why eastern pakistan broke away
efforts should have been made to bring back the biharis who are still strangled in bangladesh and would have sent gifts to keep their spirits high
but we have become insensitive if someone dies in our neighborhood we dont know it
we dont care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish
regardless of what big tragedy occurs we go about our lives normally the following day
the way east and west germany became one i wish east and west pakistan would become one again
we can once again become one if both sacrifice for each other and come out of the shell of selfishness
but this desire doesnt seem likely to be fulfilled in the near future
todays news revealed that the governor of the american state of illinois has been arrested under corruption charges
provincial congress is preparing to hold him accountable and remove him from the post of governor one of our american white friends who keeps an eye on the situation in pakistan challenged us proudly and said look this is democracy
in america even the biggest man is not above the law
and there is your country pakistan whose president got his charges dropped to become the president
my witty nature did not let me take a back seat so i said so what if one governor is arrested in america in our pakistan one prime minister was arrested in the night to be hanged and other was banished
tell me if this has ever happened in america
pakistan had awarded the badge of honor to a law breaker before his departure from the presidential house tell me if this has ever happened in america
in pakistan the chief justice was removed and could not be reinstated even with popular support has this ever happened in america
in pakistan a fake degree holder was made the minister of health has this ever happened in america
hearing this the american fell down laughing and accepted his defeat
in this picture president zardari is smiling even when he is surrounded by americans
his smile indicates
that he thinks that america is with his government but perhaps he forgot that these are the same people who were with parvez musharraf a year ago
this picture was taken as if it is a family portrait
there was no such picture a president with three american officials published in the newspapers earlier
it seems the work for america in pakistan has increased and they want more than one person to finish it or they do not trust this slave more than they believed the earlier one
it is also possible that zardaris promisebreaking stories have reached them and so they made an allowance for that
a sincere ruler would not have shown his teeth in the picture and he would at least have a little shame on his face for being a slave
if one applies the rules of democracy to this picture zardari is in the minority
in a democracy majority rules the country and who is a majority the picture speaks a lot about it
heavenly swat is called the switzerland of pakistan
as per the governments strategy talks are in progress at the same time force is also being used
but the use of force is only increasing the power of the taliban there is a sympathy among the people for them but there is no benefit beyond it
the need of the hour is to use no force but to finish the root cause of it
if the root cause is ended people like fazlullah and the taliban will be finished on their own
the proposed sharia bill by anp will solve the problems of swat to a large extent
but with the implementation of sharia law the government should also pay heed to financial problems
the initial steps taken by general musharraf started to give one a feeling that the nation will now get rid of these inefficient politicians but his greed for power has changed all of his aspirations
and the measures that were expected shattered
as bushs tenure came to an end he also became worried about the end of his government and quickly dealt with thieves
even after that general musharraf could have controlled the army but who knows what is happening with the present government
one year of army action has passed in the disturbed border province of swat and the situation is going from bad to worse
on the one hand the government is limited in this area to repeating to move a condemnation writ in the national assembly and on the other hand talibans illegal fm radio is enjoying immense popularity in swat
thirdly common citizens find it fit to obey the one who is practically in charge of this area
in swat during the operations of security forces they claimed to kill fundamentals through their gunship helicopters and cannons but despite these killings the taliban is not only becoming stronger but according to an estimate are practically ruling eighty percent of swat
the result is while the government is not ready to accept its defeat the taliban is well established there
who is caught between the line of fire poor citizens
in swat it is now said someone asked what kind of people are taliban another answered very good because they are the custodians of religion and fight against the enemies of allah and religion
again asked how is the army someone answered very good because they defend the country and fight against the enemies of the country
then again asked who are the enemies of religion and the country then came the answer we the citizens of this country
i am amazed if the pakistan army cannot control a small group of taliban how would it fight a war with india army
they could not even track the illegally operated taliban fm channel which i believe is easy to track
even now this fm channel is spitting fire with great fanfare
boys schools are being destroyed after closing down girls schools
a curfew is imposed so that talibans can move easily from one place to another
tonight eight trucks barged into mengura during curfew hours and created a front overnight
the question is how did they reach there during curfew
the army can kill akbar bagti in his house and salutes the taliban
for allahs sake somebody make this army understand to remove the innocent people of swat and prove that the pakistan army can beat any enemy
hadrat said that religion has been the reason for all the bloodshed in the world tell me if there were no religion wouldnt there have been this bloodshed
punjabi pathan white and black mahsood and other tribes is this an outcome of religion
no not at all sir religion teaches no difference between a white and a black a punjabi and a muhajir if it was not for religion this world would long ago have been destroyed in the name of white and black and countless other castebased conflicts
actually it is only religion that teaches us moral values and asks us to follow it it has not come on its own the creator of the universe sent it (to us) and we have to live according to his orders
as a muslim i completely believe that islam is a complete way of life and a true religion
after settling down in london every morning i would call my relatives to ask about their wellbeing whereas the fact is that not one of them had ever bothered to call me and ask how we are doing then i realized that they dont even like us to call them i stopped calling them
living here in france for two years i also felt the same
i dont understand why people expect only us to call
a bill about iraq is passed in a few hours sending a peace army to darfur is not an issue
the mumbai attack was immediately condemned and banning suspicious organizations is just a matter of few hours
and we are debating about a place where death is dancing on our heads
o the custodians of world peace here life is ending
are you waiting for it to take its last breath
so that no victim on this earth will think again of using a weapon of mass destruction like the catapult
when a father runs carrying his sons dead body on his shoulder does it move you or does your heart remain without a shiver of pain
if not then you dont deserve to be called a human being
but rather a blot on the name of humanity
well at least this has established the fact that this has been israels country for thousands of years
the need of the moment requires both communities to live together with love and harmony but since their chords are in the hands of western and arab countries peace cannot be restored until and unless they wish it to be
now even iran wants to fight her proxy war from this land
even if israel stops its assault for now it would merely require a single incident to restart it all over again
the bbcs country shares its benefits with america and israel and this is the reason why they came up with a series of sahyooniyat pasand blogs under the guise of open mindedness and is offering onesided propaganda
the bbc is only observing formalities and its only objective and motto are to gather sympathy
its a request to the moderator to publish fidwis review again so that we understand that there are some traces of truth remaining in the bbc
thanks
i dont know who wrote this story or how this story came into being but one thing is clear that in every era dracula has been drinking human blood
battles were fought in every age and there was bloodshed
but surprisingly the 21st century man who claims to be more civilized is keeping mum about these killings
whatever is happening is presenting a bad face of humanity (before us) how can you fail to feel it
sincerely sajjah al hasnain hydrabad deccan
right now summer rains have started showering on dera gazi khan along with the whole country
i am presenting a poem depicting the climate enjoy the rain with this poem
it rains because of you
if raining it is winter
if it stops it is patience
sometimes it comes without reason
sometimes it blankets like a night
sometimes it is sound and sometimes it is silent
it rains because of you
in my memory some night
to a bowed ash
i had defused it forever sometimes
and sometimes i lit myself with me
there are drops of agony at times
it rains because of you
all these leaders will run with their briefcases they dont care if the country survives or not
whether people sell tooth powder or clean temple bells with lemon peels
on the one hand our media also is also corrupt like our leaders
and its only motto is to grab money from the government and nothing else
as far as people are concerned they are illiterate and the one who talks about it is the most illiterate of them all
a strange thing happened yesterday noon
nobody was bothered about the illegal parking all the police men were running here and there
illegal park and nypd traffic was in a mood to look at the vehicles
it so happened that a us air aircraft literally became a ship and landed in the hudson river
so far only this much is known that the terrorists belong to a family of birds called geese
yesterday new york saw historic cold
normally temperature does not fall this low
when i went outside for a halfhour walk my jaw started aching
you can imagine what must have happened to those who jumped from the aircraft
the good thing is all were safe
and the disappointment is that the aircraft sank in this time of financial crisis
while seeing all this i reached new jersey via the westside highway and i was aware and saw that the southbound lanes were closed even after that i did it
and while returning i was caught in the same rush
it was good that they had opened the road to an extent during my one hour trip and i got an exit at 56th street
i had not taken an exit after seeing a huge queue over there
makki my pakistan well eid mubarak to you

we unnecessarily think that this swati taliban group who are against womens education is uncivilized
they show their anger every day by demolishing girls schools or colleges somewhere
like most of the ideas this idea was also proved to be wrong according to a cnn news report on the sacred day of monday some boys of a taliban group has bombarded a school
swat taliban boys demolished a boys school
girls schools were demolished first by practicing the english concept ladies first i dont know why people are still hellbent to prove that talibanis are uncultured and uncivilized barbarians
this also proves one thing that this allegation that the taliban group is only against girls education is not right
rather masha allah they are against education itself
may allah give them strength so that they can topple this government
who are ruling us from its roots
this has taken the place of the news of a girl married to a dog a little while back
look at that bridegroom
even in the 21st century humanity is a rarity
this is the computer age and it has barged into all walks of life
many people have reservations about the computers growing influence like financial issues
while using a credit card makes your life easier it also allows lawenforcement organizations to monitor your personal life
now with the help of your credit card financial transaction record you can be traced
and in future when the use of actual money will be less its importance will increase
similarly in the crime world credit card information is preferred to robbing a bank
in the same way the computer has become a medium to make friends
social networking websites like orkut facebook and my space are on top in the popularity chart
dont you think the more we are becoming a slave of this social networking the more we are getting away from people of practical life
there are matchmaking web sites where your likings are matched with other people and matched lists are shown to the people interested
can you live a life of some person who is exactly like you
i cant live such a life this is why a life partner is called the better half
so that she fills me with what is not in me
i think i have very little brains
right from my childhood whatever my elders told me about something it became the ultimate truth for me
as if my abba jaan knows the answers to all the questions
people used to mock me
but i always believed in something which could be possible
i get restless thinking that there was no need to say false things
even in this age i faced loss
therefore i make the effort to speak less and less false
dont blame anyone for the wrong reasons and that too swearing in the name of allah
and insha allah whatever you will ask from allah will be fulfilled
rest allah is aware of your intentions
this is a disgusting problem that occurs because people are away from religion
according both to our religion and pakistans law the custody of a minor child should be given to the mother
their expenses are the responsibility of the father and he can also visit the children
once the children become adults it is their choice whom they want to live with
you wrote it right that the real problems lie with the relatives who give wrong suggestions
federal thinking controls our actions
here also the same thinking seems to be functioning in that new people will be sharing in ancestral property and then they oppose it otherwise what their father had done is commendable and could be imitated
as far as relationships are concerned these restrictions created social problems
getting a divorcee or a widow married is becoming tougher with passing time
because of these unnecessary customs and traditions the family system is on the verge of dispersion
if the wife of a 5055 year old man or a husband of a wife of the same age passed away in our society and they opt for a second marriage why dont we see this positively
a pakistani uncle lives nearby his wife expired about 1012 years ago now after marrying off all his children when he married a widow his children turn against him
according to me it is his sharia right what do you say
we cant see anyone taking the place of our mother we cant tolerate it what kind of thinking is this
according to me the children of that person should see it logically that if he married a widow after marrying off all his children what is wrong in that
this way that widow got support and that uncle also got someone to look after his home
because his children would definitely be engaged and happy in their own world and would not be able to devote time to him
the reason for this is illiteracy
this is a result of societal pressure
when people make fun of such families for doing something like this then the chilren are ashamed of their parents second marriage
this situation should be fought against and it should be mentioned that their father acted according to islamic law
this is a curse in our society that has hunted us down in last 4050 years
a wife can bear an illegitimate relationship of her husband but would not allow him a second marriage
if it is possible they would not allow to do it even after their death
they ruin their aakhirat along with that of their husbands and become a huge reason to spread this filth in society
nothing happens by only blowing the trumpet of islam we actually like whatever is in our culture and custom
for example tv vehicles and keeping girls away from education and there is a fear about marrying by ones own choice
as far as your question is concerned then mister why do you bring a widow home instead you should be going to her house so that the relatives keep quiet after creating artificial havoc (well there will be a stomach ache in the widows family)
in the indopak subcontinent we embraced islam many centuries ago but we could not get away with this thinking and preferred customs and traditions to islam
because of this pattern of thinking we consider a second marriage of a male as bad divorce as a blot divorcee women an untouchable marriage of ones choice as a stain on ones honor and marriage of a man with an aged woman is considered a deceitful tactics of the woman
on top of that while imitating the west we condemn prayers and pardah as old fashioned
embracing islam was easy but getting away from this thought was tough
may allah give us audacity for this
ameen
writing urdu was never this tough
it took ages to write this little
think more of the less i wrote
allah hafiz
but here the situation is something else
they say that people are there to die for us if i die i am martyred
if a commoner dies he is killed
assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatahu
today after isha prayers when i was coming towards my shop a man who was sitting in a vehicle raised his hand and summoned me
i thought this man has forgotten his way or wanted to ask something i stopped and when i looked into the car his whole family was in it
he asked me if i understand arabic well i said no problem tell me what is the matter
he started saying i came from riyaz to madinah but someone picked my pocket please help me i asked for an excuse because one such incident had happened to me even earlier i gave that man a note of 20 riyals to get the gasoline to go back to riyaz but after going a little ahead he started to do it again
i got very angry i shouted at him and threatened to call the police then he ran away
this is the situation of us muslims we come with our families in cars to beg and earn at least two to three thousand a day
while there is a clear hadith (pbuh) the upper hand is better than the underhand and the upper hand is the hand of the giver
(may allah bless us and make us good muslims ameen)

a highlyplaced american official said that president obama will take a tough stand about afghan president hamid karzai
in the new afghan policy of america war is preferred to development
officials said that hamid karzai is seen as a hurdle in achieving american goals because corruption prevails in the government the drug business is flourishing and taliban is becoming united once again
american officials said that the people in the american administration who are pressurizing karzai to take more action are vice president joe biden and obamas representative for afghanistan and pakistan richard holbrooke
he said that this strategy surfaced after bush who would talk to hamid karzai on a video conference every two weeks and highlight americas role in rebuilding new urban institutions in afghanistan left office
officials said that the obama administration will work with provincial leaders as an alternative to the central government
officials said that they would pressurize hamid karzai to wage a tough war against corruption
hamid karzai would be facing election in the new year and it is not clear as yet whether obama and his friends will support him or not
is this statement by american officials about afghanistan a hint of change in american policy
is hamid karzais time over

the sri lankan cricket team has arrived in pakistan to play a oneday international series
in the wake of indiapakistan tension the visit of a foreign country to pakistan is commendable
the sri lankan team was welcomed at the karachi airport
karachi will host two oneday matches between pakistan and karachi while the third oneday will be played in lahore
both teams are making tall claims about their bowling batting and fielding
sri lankans are proud of their spinners while pakistan trusts its fast bowlers
sri lankan captain mahela jaywardane said that not one player but rather the whole pakistani team is dangerous
murlitharan and mendis will be the trump cards while pakistan had hinted the series to be a tough one
shoeb malik said that they had played murlitharan they will see mendis we have a secret plan ready and we will show it on the pitch
is the series going to be as interesting as sri lanka and pakistan are claiming
who will have an upper hand during pakistan and sri lanka series

it is their handywork kashmir has been fighting a battle of independence for the last sixty years
no one has ever bothered to talk to them now that they are trapped between the battles against extremism and terrorism people are talking to them for truce
earlier they killed muslim masses and now they want to solve these issues
anyway pakistan needs to understand their dual policy
asad khan london
india is creating such a situation to divert world attention from kashmir
but pakistan has always shown the real face of india to the world
now even the british government understands everything this is the reason why india is trying to defame pakistan in the name of terrorism and overlook the kashmir occupation
and hesitate to talk to pakistan on this issue
the british foreign minister david milibend said that a solution to the kashmir issue can end terrorism and the pakistan government can effectively tackle the dangers arising in the border areas
it is to be noted that newly elected american president obama also expressed such views about kashmir
while talking to the media in mumbai and in one of his articles the british foreign minister said that the idea to wage war against terrorism is wrong it was a policy of expresident bush to kill people in the name of danger to his nation
david milibend told pakistan not to go soft on fundamental groups
is india trying to draw attention away from kashmir by creating tension there only because big powers of the world are insisting on a solution to the kashmir issue
is the terror attack in mumbai a part of that strategy
is india trying to escape from concrete talks by taking worlds attention to terrorism

i think the superpowers do not want to finish pakistan completely
but are thinking of keeping it under their control as they are aware that pakistan is a nuclear power
they want to create a revolutionlike situation here
external countries are thinking that cornering pakistan could create geopolitical problems they want to help pakistan as well as keep their objectives going

it is always a hindu custom to murmur the name of rama and keep a dagger hidden in their robes
what i think is after a while they go through an urge to speak and they start threatening pakistan
we are ready on all counts the chief of the indian army should keep his mouth shut or else we know how to give them a fitting answer

american president george bush in his last press conference as president said advising newly elected president barak obama that he made many mistakes during his tenure and barak obama should go ahead doing what he feels is right
i as a president acted according to the situations and american law and order i preferred my popularity over americas welfare
he said the enemies of america are planning to attack america even today it will be the biggest challenge for obama to stop these attacks
he said that not finding the weapons of mass destruction from iraq was his greatest disappointment and claiming the completion of the mission in iraq was my biggest mistake
addressing his last press conference in the white house the american president said this is my last press conference and i thank all journalists present at this conference and other people who came here today

this is a very painful tragedy that israelis are killing palestinians and kashmir is facing the same problem but the security council does not seem to be paying any heed to it quite unmoved
all the organizations that are present in palestine and kashmir should keep the fight going until they get freedom they should remain united to sustain all kinds of attack insha allah their martyrdom will not go in vain
israeli air strikes on gaza are still on hundreds of palestinian men women and children have been martyred by now
nazaryan an important hamas political leader was martyred with his wife and children
there the security council meeting is over without any decision
in assembly a condemnation bill was presented by libya and other arab countries against israel it could face an american opposition
israeli jets are bombarding palestinian cities for the last many days
the whole world shouts in one voice against the mumbai attacks but no one including america and britain seems to be bothered about israeli attacks that are killing hundreds of innocent citizens
why are muslim countries quiet

in my opinion the real problem in our community is illiteracy they are not at all aware where the money is going the government is only interested in bringing in taxes the problems with electricity and gas will remain the same
because everyone knows what kind of character the officials who are elected by the people have
the scarcity of electricity and gas across pakistan has become serious
on the other hand gas rates were increased by an average of 8 while since january 1 nonavailability of petrol has become a major problem for the people
there are reactions agitations and violent processions against the scarcity of gas and electricity in industrial and commercial areas of pakistan
industrialists have threatened to shut down their factories
because of eight to ten hours of blackouts there is restlessness amongst the people of karachi
industrial life is almost paralyzed
governement organizations are explaining their stand by blaming each other
they are talking about an increase in electricity and gas prices isnt it a joke
why is attention not being paid to solving the problem

the indian government has cancelled the indian teams tour to pakistan
india was going to play three tests five oneday matches and one twenty20 match during the tour
rajeev shukla vicepresident of the board of control for cricket in india told geo tv that the board had asked the government for permission to tour pakistan but the request was denied because of the current tensions between the two countries and that the tour will not be possible
is it fair on the part of indian government to cancel the tour basing its reasoning on the current political situation or do you think that sports and politics should be kept separate
is this decision made by the indian government harmful to cricket

indias attitude has changed after the mumbai attack
jagjeet singh has reacted to it by saying that he hates pakistan and the pakistanis
it should be noted that adnaan sami sang with asha bhonsle how can he all of a sudden start singing out of tune adnaan sami should stay in india forever and never come back here again

and makes statements according to the needs of the hour oh pakistanis open your eyes and see for yourself how much you are appreciated in india try to understand the hindu mentality
after the mumbai attack their statements of hate have increased now they are spitting fire at the famous singer adnaan sami
after that the journalist removed one of his shoes and hurled it at bush because ofbushs alertness he ducked his head before it could stike and saved himself
the second shoe hit the american flag
security personnel pounced on the journalist and removed him from the scene
president bush told the people that he was not aware why the journalist did this that it was a size 10 shoe and that he was fine
what do you think is this act of the journalist an indication of popular iraqi sentiment

after the mumbai terror attack the tension between india and pakistan grew to a new high when an indian air force aircraft breached pakistani air borders over the lahore and kashmir sectors
due to the pakistan air forces retaliation indian aircrafts had to go back
according to sources both indian planes were loaded with weapons and explosives
in the current tense situation this is a unique incident
according to the pakistan air force it is completely equipped to defend the country
information minister sherry rahman said that the indian government accepted that there is a breach of air boundaries but that this happened by mistake
pakistani military sources termed this incident as serious
what do you think does india really want to perform an air strike on pakistan
is indias stance that the air breach was a mistake the truth or did india want to analyze the capabilities of the pakistan air force
will this incident increase the tension between the two countries
