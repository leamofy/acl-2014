the role of european union for the peace in middle east
from official point of view the role of european union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the middle east
according to the official stand of brussels schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of sarkozy are helping hands in this process
the spokesperson of the european commission amadeu altafaj said that every effort which helps advancing the joint message of the european union to the two parties is welcome
it seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned
but in reality the european union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions
as the president of the union the czech republics role is weak to start with
on top of that internal fighting has made it all the more helpless
on the other hand the french president sarkozy is behaving like if he is still the president of the european union
although 6 months presidency tenure of france is over
sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it
the most funny situation is faced by the french foreign minister bernard kouchner
he is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of czech republic schwarzenberg
what is even worse is that both the foreign ministers are giving different statements on the middle east war
schwarzenberg says that israel has the right to defend itself whereas according to kouchner this war does not come under defense policy on the other side germany has also sent its special ambassador to middle east european union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues
its proof is the israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the european union
this is a golden chance for the european union to do something since america due to the policies of george w bush has already failed in the middle east
financial crisis suicide of a billionaire german industrialist
adolf merckle a resident of sawabia in southern germany left a huge business group behind him
but earlier common german citizens did not know much about him

the number of employees of the merkel group around the world is near 100000 and its foundation company the pharmaceutical ratiopharm always had special importance
adolf merkel has said many times in his life it has been four generations since i started making medicine
now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and i hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years
after the suicide of adolf merkel the banks have provided approval for temporary loans of 400 million euro for vem group but added the condition that vem should sell off ratiopharm to improve the financial situation for a long term sustainability
after the death of adolf marclay the marclay group will not remain the same as it was before

province sarhad government rejected the question of ban on girls education

on sunday the education minister of the border district sardar hussain babar has added saying that the government will never allow these obligations to succeed

if taken can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age by more than a third
the research happening in the moffitt cancer center in the american state of florida has showed that chances of getting tumor of chest cancer in those women under 50 years of age
the research also said that having more than three cups of tea daily in women over the age of 50 has on special benefits
experts believe that the reason behind this is that tea has some elements that are effective against the formation of cancer cells in women mainly under the age of 50
in moffitt cancer center in the city of tampa florida state a research was conducted on over 5000 women who had undergone treatment for breast cancer
experts compared their medical records and lifestyles with women who were safe from breast cancer
the experts also found out that on a particular type of cancer lobular tea had shown a great effect and it reduced by 66 percent
a tenth of every breast cancer patient suffers this type of cancer
this type of cancer is more dangerous because it deep inside and is usually diagnosed when it has already spread to a great extent

war in afghanistan is the greatest army challenge facing america gates
american defense minister robert gates has said that the war in afghanistan is the biggest military challenge faced by america
gates is today giving a briefing to american senate and representatives of the congress on the obama administrations policy on afghanistan and iraq wars
gates told the armed services committee of the senate that fight is not the only solution to the afghanistan issue but he added that in order to secure several areas sufficient number of troops is not there and the talibans take advantage of that to carry out their activities
why reduction in exercise with increase in the age
new research
exercise at any age is good for health
it energizes your heart reduces the cholesterol level helps in keeping the weight low helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of alzheimer or dementia
unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age
experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it
the american medical association says that many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out
dr pattricia p leka of maya clinic minnesota says that increase in age is a big reason for being handicapped from exercise and less physical activity
dr patricia teaches medicine at mayo clinic
she headed a research regarding heart diseases and mans ability to do exercise in older age
the team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart
in which the pumping of the blood by the heart its contraction and relaxation was studied
the experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood
they came to know that with increase in age problems increase in the relaxation action of heart
dr patricia says that with increase in age the problems in the heart relaxation rates increases and thus effects the ability to exercise with growing age
dr garwin cain was also a part of this study
he says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this and this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart
sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases
if the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard then they can take advantage of the benefits of exercise even with the age
a detailed report of this has been published in the magazine of the american medical association
there are no chances of an immediate war with pakistan indian army chief
the chief of the indian army general deepak kapoor has stated that there are no chances of immediate war with pakistan however to serve the country and protect its interests they are always ready
general kapoor blamed that despite of sureties and international pressure in result of mumbai attacks in his words terrorism network is not only present in pakistan but is also active
he said this in srinagar while talking to correspondents
the indian army chief was on a one day tour to the valley of kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in new delhi administered kashmir and preparation of armed forces on the borders
he was asked as to what his reaction was to the media reports which state that pakistan refuted the proof presented by india about the mumbai attacks
general kapoor said that the decisions of peace or war matters are taken by the political leadership
talking about the alleged terrorism network in pakistan he said that indian army will have to face the forces which are objected to destroy peace and weaken india
he said that 700 to 800 militants are present in indian kashmir almost half of them are foreigners
general deepak kapoor said that with an improvement in the seasonal weather there might be an increase in infiltration from pakistan and pakistan occupied kashmir however india has increased the guard at the borders
he refused the chances of reducing the number of deployed army in indian administered kashmir by saying that no compromise on country security
may god answer the worlds prayers and may barrack obama be beneficial for the world
though there is not much hope but we shall see how the relationship between america and pakistan effected by this change are in our favor
and what barack obama who is the result of martin luther kings dreams gives to the world
the oath taking of obama as the president of america whose part of the name is also hussain is where historically important in all the ways is also a great challenge for the history
not only for himself but also for all the people who supported him
this will also be a test for white people majority as it is not easy for them to accept heartily the presidency of black on them
here south asia specially muslims who have expectations from them should remember that he has been elected as the president of america and obama should remember that president of america is actually the president of the entire world
a little while from then a person whose real brothers were brought to america from their own countries wearing the neckband of slaveryand whose blood and sweat watered the roots of the strongest country of the new era today the a representative of that very same targeted lineage will be called the 44th president
many people have expectations from this one man
it is necessary for people who likes him not to have over expectations from him
if obama succeeds in lowering race religion and other differences then it will be a victory for people who love him
what will be its effect on south asia and can a meaningful change be expected in the american policy regarding this matter
how will this change effect the relationship between america and pakistan
my sir whether it be obama or someone else the type of policies with regards to the whole world is decided by the multibillionaire influential strong jewish lobby
and as far as pakistan is concerned after the series of recent bombay blaststhe offensive reaction of india america and israel is in front of everyone
even for a while after pakistan was formed the managing of swat was left to the ruler of swat which had its own army and law
with a help of an agreement they transferred the administration of swat to the pakistan government
but it is matter of sorrow that our government treated swat like a step mother
there was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government of the ruler of swat
nor was there any interest in the construction and development over there
currently the number of girls acquiring education is far less than in previous years
targeting of educational institutes is continued by local talibans in nwfp province of pakistan
the most schools were destroyed in swat province of which the majority were girls schools
not only this taliban has announced a ban on girls education
thousands of students are being deprived of education
what do you think by stopping girls education what the taliban want to achieve
why the government has failed to stop these illegal actions
what do you think the government should do
the question should be that what isi and pakistani agencies will get
because swat people has understand the game that army is there to serve taliban not to kill them otherwise how five schools can be destroyed in a single night during curfew how people can be butchered and hanged in the square
when the writ of the government is not being let implemented how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities
now the question arises as to when the government has an armed military new and dangerous weapons new technology and spy system etc then why are these four taliban not being controlled
the answer to this is that they have the hand of a hidden guide on their heads because of which neither do their weapons get exhausted nor do they get captured
the conclusion is that taliban with there deeds making the work easier for world power
15 years ago the war was on in afghanistan
isi had control over taliban which was supported by russia india and iran
then suddenly the scenario changed and the activities of the taliban came into light
and isi was also offered dollars from america so past friends became enemies
now the situation has changed but the war is still going on and those supporting them in pakistan are still russia india and iran
it is a human mistake of doing wrong by not doing what is right
as an example a thief when goes to steal if he at that time gets this thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse there is also punishment in it and he fears from god then that human will not steal
similarly as long as israel does not realize that it is doing wrong and spilling the blood of the innocent and it will receive punishment for that it will continue to play holi with the blood of the innocent people in gaza
greetings
question is that is war armed movement terrorism is solution to problems
if not then what is that chemical prescription that will take us to the solution of these problems
this extremist path of war does not solve our problems but increases them
palestine afghanistan and iraq should adopt the same model for their development that nelson mandela had used in south africa
that is to struggle character wise and politically more than in an armed manner
kashmiris participation in election shows that they have accepted this point
the israeli attacks on gaza still continue in the third week and the death toll have reached to one thousand
despite worldwide diplomatic efforts to date a ceasefire was not possible
according to another report since the start of attacks on the 27th of december 90000 palestinians have left their homes and moved towards safer locations
here aid groups have accused israel of being careless about palestinian children and said that a whole generation of palestinian children will be victim of grave psychological and emotional difficulties

taliban should be given a chance
basit peshawar
wake up if taliban starts the real jihad who will slaughter innocent people
who will burn down girls schools
and kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money who will hang people on poles by claiming they were american spies
those taliban give very damage to islam that no other nation or religion have done
pashtoon rore
kohat pakistan
if the whole muslim world just give a joint threat to attack israel you will see that how upset will its father america be
and not only will their be immediate talks of ceasefire there will also be an actual ceasefire
but what can be done where should our muslim leaders bring the courage from
someone tell ahmed nayad to take the first step as he is very popular for his bravery at the bbc forums
the responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on arabs and the muslim world but its and obligation on the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny
this sad incident the worst crime committed by bush
just like in pakistan and india before 30th june or the end of the fiscal year the government institutions are looted the american regime just before its end have given a green signal to israel to do what ever it wants
on one hand america says that it will try for a ceasefire
on the other hand the united nations is passing resolution after resolution but actionwise neither have done anything there is only one meaning of this and that is that the even the united nations is openly in favor of destroying the muslims
all muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the united nations and should establish their own global organisation
many examples are in front of us where only promises and resolutions of america and united nations came forward but only the muslims suffered
what is the use of these vain efforts if bbc does not want to publish anything
now where are all the journalism principles when it comes to muslims blood bbc seems to take its eyes off the reality
by the way is a flag bearer of rights
pubslishing something from their own sounds far they even dint publish the discussions
the difference between you and jews is that they call themselves jews and martyr the muslims and people like you live among muslims by calling themselves muslims to muslims
syja786
for a long time on bbc forums sometimes suicide bombing and other times terrorism in india was used to target a certain sect
extremism is the favorite word for those antiislamic comments
but by viewing the above comment you can easily diffrentiate who is the actual extremist in which almost a fatwa of blasphemy has been pronounced for writing against iran
when will our muslims understand that dajjal can not be fought with the sword
after seeing the bombardment of israel in which innocent people unarmed heart cries tears of blood what to do
but the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that we try to use the name of jihad to disfigure the beautiful face of islam
when majority of palestinians accepted the existence of israel then why did hammas need to fire those rockets on israel and made suicide attacks
attitude of the both the sides is against humanity
the character played by america and united nations again showed us their support for the cruelties of israel
may allah give muslim nation the understanding of becoming united ameen
and the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism after all they are doing the real work
otherwise would it be possible for terrorism to take place at such a large scale without the support of some big leader and everyone knows who is controlling the strings
in such a situation it can be termed as high handedness do what ever you can
that it even hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry
the medicines for the injured the shroud and compensation for the dead are being given by the arab rulers and the question is
what should be done about israeli attacks
this is the actual problem that the leaders of muslim countries including saudi crownprince are in a false sleep neither they have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities
they should immediately take practical steps against the israel
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to european countries and america but alas they
regards to all brothers and sisters
i believe that in this time of difficulty telling hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans and it is similar to considering them defeated
if the israelites and their supporters are at a rise then soon moses shall be born as this is the law of nature america and israel work as gunpowder amongst suicide bombers in muslims
the power drunk elephants do not understand this
abu abdullah pakistan
now hamas and israel should seize fire to stop bloodshed
mohammad sarfaraz paris france
very rightly said
supposing that hamas is 100 on the truth and they are struggling against oppression to become successful in the eyes of allah even then they should know that if a good deed is resulting in the destruction of an established house it is no more a good deed
those who claim to love god love the messenger and love their religion loving mankind is a part of their faith
as if it is the order of allah to evacuate all the people of the book from the face of the earth other than the muslims
najeeburrehman psycho lahore pkitn
no not to kill them but rather the order is to invite them to islam
but jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion
one should fight with them until they finish their conspiracies but this certainly does not mean that they can wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd
brothers the end result of killing innocent children is destruction
but i would like to tell my friends that yesterday the israelis did not have any place for shelter but today they have become so strong that they do not listen to anyone this is because the jews are one
they do not have shiite nor sunni all are just jews and they have succeeded in every field and made everything
in contrast what is the condition of 55 islamic countries
they are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death
the need is for all the muslim countries to get togetherand prepare an action plan against israel
feroz magsi jhang pakistan
and there is no better course of action than accepting israel learn new technology and ways of success from them and let the world live in peace
muslims have plenty of land and resources
the need is of proper use
first the part that hurts the most is that there could not be unity between hamas and alfath
great leaders like yasir arafat and sheikh yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing jihad for the aqsa mosque and this was impossible without removing yasin and arafat from the way
the world is watching how after these two leaders palestinians second by second scattering
and how the jewish lobby is increasing its reach second by second
in 1974 a pakistani prime minister was of such an international trust that first time in history he united all the muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance
today on his 81st birthday is it a very difficult task that the whole nation promise to not only keep unity in its lines
but by eliminating the differences between other muslims will accomplish its (establishment of islamic common wealth) incomplete mission
this is a jinn which has entered palestine for half a century
that jinn has many mouths
many a times this jinn calls itself bad names from one of its other mouths to divert the attention and reduce the pressure of the world from it
and this jinn other face eating peoples in iraq afghanistan iran and pakistan
this monster is most unhappy with islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through islam muslims the perfect religion of muslim and practical islam as the history tells that islam has put giants like abu jehl on the right path
bombing from israeli fighter planes on gaza has continued since 27th of december
more than three hundred israeli citizens have died so far in these attacks
after air attacks now israeli tanks and with other military vehicles of land inspection have reached the border of gaza
the security council of the united nations through an agreed upon resolution passed in an emergency meeting have demanded that israeli and palestinian authorities stop extremist activities immediately
however israeli officials claim that they will continue their action in gaza until they are convinced that israel will be safe from rocket attacks
in your opinion is this right for israel to say about this inspection is to protect israel
in this situation is the world organization playing its role
can this inhumane action have a direct relation with the upcoming elections in israel
can any improvement be expected in the situation in middle east after the succession of the newly elected american president barak obama

zaheer chughtai
in this art now a days the pakistani electronic and print media specially some urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the grudge of muavia written on them
has said that the united nations which apparently talks of human rights and peace but when it comes to grimness and coercion over muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that hamas should stop the attacks how long this hypocrisy will continue
why is so much oppression being done on the muslims if people such as america stop supporting these jews then allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people and such people can never lead a proper life so if the americans have courage let them stop their support and then see what kind of life they get
the famous just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice and not by being unjust and killing people
if any tribe could be finished by killing their people and if the required results could be obtained then after hitlers steps not only the presence but the rise that the jews are enjoying today could not have been possible
in the words of a poet
abuse is again an abuse if its get higher it will be erased
blood is again a blood if it falls down it will freeze
now who will tell whom what is terrorism
why this all does not comes under terrorism why only our pain is seems to be like every ones pain
why the other people are not the human beings or only muslims blood has become so cheap these many innocents blood was not red in color
and now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere
i watched the progress of the mumbai incident as if my own house was on fire the sorrow of humans can not be watched and who can not see this sorrow if only muslims would think a bit together
dead bodies on the road helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood how shall we condemn i can not find words
i feel like crying over the helplessness of the muslims that on one side people are being killed in india so the rest of the world comes over pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations otherwise we will do it ourselves
and on the other side israel is ruthlessly killing muslims and the whole world is silent this is unbearable
there is delay but no darkness with god that too when this darkness comes to pass
in the presence of america danger to the integrity of israel is a joke
as for elections there is no doubt to gain public support such actions will have to be taken for the sake of power especially in a state like israel as for barack obama history is witness that no american ruler has been able to go against the american policy and nor will they go whether the ruler is white or black he is still a ruler
from the discussions going on in the forum it seems that everyone is hurt over her death but as a politician her mistakes have not been ignored
this issue is debatable as to whether benazir gave her life for democracy or for power
if she sacrificed for democracy then why she left democracy in the dictatorship of musharraf for 10 years till she got a deal and american clearance
benazir did not come to pakistan when the people needed her the most unfortunately she came to pakistan when she had to deal with cases and was promised a seat of power
no one is going to say anything about the way that this historical figure is being falsely accused

some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them just like a donkey doesnt become a scholar if you put books on him
although the ongoing talks between pakistan and india were interrupted after the bombay attacks but pakistan and india should continue these meetings
if we talk about war then at the both end there will be a loss of human being
india says that the man caught in the mumbai attacks is a pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to pakistan in urdu but on the other hand when india initially apprehended this extremist they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader point to be noted
first of all merry christmas to mr bhana and all christian friends of the forum
friends of the forum greetings mr psycho a raza sister sana sister shahida akram and all
we do not want the flames of fire but flowers of peace
war itself is a problem
will war give solution to problems
it will give fire and blood today
it will give hunger and need tomorrow
therefore wise humans
if war keeps getting postponed its better
in your and our garden
if the candle keeps burning its better
indoamerican relations have now gotten quite deep and india knows with certainty that america will openly betray pakistan when the time comes
this is also the old history of america
though in case of an attack by india america will achieve her goals and the expenditure will all be that of india
pakistan should clearly announce that it will not start but if injury is caused there will be no talks of peace or truce and the war will not stop until india is completely destroyed or captured even if it involves our destroying ourselves
this is the islamic history
even before this resolution the pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give
indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the mumbai attacks are making it more clever that effected and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has relaxed its pressure now
while ignoring indias unnecessary bobbery the satisfaction of the united nations and the appreciation from the interpol chief over pakistans efforts is a side effect of indias overwhelming diplomacy
there is no two opinions about this being a very beastly action
but the question is that when thousands of taliban attacked the house of pir samiullah where and what was the pakistani army doing at that time
should the army not be taken into account as to what they did there for one year
every day how many taliban die due to the firing of the thousands of mortar and canon shells they fire
and stop this fake operation
the day is not far when a resolution will be passed in the united nations against army intervention in pakistan in the same way as it was passed against jamaathuddawah
the extremists of our country and their supporters themselves are constantly providing all evidences and justifications required for instigation of action against them and god forbid the day when such a resolution is passed in all likelihood not a single voice would be raised in united nations in our favour
and suppose if this resolution took time to approve then considering the example of america any country will launch the attack at her own
we are not aware and familiar with the character and achievements of pir samiullah and what his activities were
perhaps he was not a revolutionist
as the bodies of comrade che guevara nawab akbar khan bagti dr najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy
they command even after they die
but there is an international game being played over here here they are ruling by scaring the public about beastliness and terror
there are so that she could be having that if we are not be spokesman ferocious and come to destroy the government
in the name of religion activities of these so called islam lovers is highly condemned
these supporters of extremists can see the injustice of america but instead of expressing grieve on those dishonest acts they clearly shun them by giving them name of tribal traditions
any person with a heart can never accept these beastly actions which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of islam
in my opinion people of our army are with these people
this is because when these people move around at least some time will be taken to catch them will only take so much time but forget about getting to that spot even if they were there they escape from there
are these people so brave that they take 50 or 70 people hostage and our army watches like an audience with hand on hand
they are also servants of allah and so is the army
it is clear that something is sinister
instead of promoting gods blessing and merciful nature discussing various disastrous and lesson gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen and besides the event of hanging the dead body their literature and books like what will happen after death also create fear and terror
and these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power
preachers
like you have scared the world from the fire of hell
it is surprising when it is said that this can not be a work of a muslim
we are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it
was the attack on medina by the the army of yazid and and the incident of karbala was the conspiracy of jews and pagans
without accepting the facts neither motives can be removed nor these can be corrected

it is carried out by american and pakistani agencies and peer sahib is a victim of conspiracy
all discussions on this forum will now be anti taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined taliban and they are doing what can change the public opinion
what i only want to ask is when the body was hanging for a whole day what were the army doing were they there to only target civilians all they give their speeches is due to bombing taliban tanks there fell a bomb on house resulting death of two children and mother
did they not know about this mistake
were they leisurely having fun or not
we fold our hands and request them to please for gods sake stop this game
after all there is a ruler above you
whether the question asked by bbc is understandable or not it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer for instance no one asked what the army of 30000 in swat went there to do
the helpers of the army were hanging on poles the dead bodies of those who fought taliban
whatever the green footed pakistani government did with the swat public the media including bbc did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality
the pakistani army drama
every child in swat is saying that this is a bloody drama
for gods sake stop this drama
these talibans have destroyed the image of muslims
through out the world if muslims dont tell them muslims then why would terrorists are found in their territories
those who become insensitive and people who dont want to work hard take guns and join these groups
have shame
its need is neither in any religion nor in any customs
all media including bbc show different views on taliban and tribals
but nobody knows what the actual situation is it is we who know about it because we are tribals
in short its a game in which cia raw mosad and our own isi are invloved no one is a talib or a tribal who made these institutions warmongers who are against islam taliban madrassas pushtoon people tribes and tribal traditions
because of this act head of the muslims petulance of shame
i salute mqm leader altaf hussain anp and ppp leaders who are against this cancer it means talk against taliban
this cancer is a product of ziaulhaq who died but also destroyed pakistan
but i am hopeful that current leadership will end this cancer
after the mumbai attacks india had said that there was the hand of some pakistani extremists behind the attack
pakistan refuted these claims and said that it would help india in investigation in every possible way
india said that it has given a list to pakistan that has 20 suspected extremists required by india
now pakistan said that the jaishemohammad leader who is included in the list moulana masood azhar is not under house arrest and that the government of pakistan has no information about him
before this president asif ali zardari has denied the impression that western secret agencies and indian government have provided pakistan the proves of mumbai attacks
president zardari said regarding ajmal kasab that it is not yet proven that he is pakistani
meanwhile prime minister manmohan singh has warned pakistan that its relation with india can not improve unless its land is being used for terrorism
and in latest development indian cricket team has cancelled their tour of pakistan
should these political events affect sports
what do you see as the future of pakistan and india relations
neither america nor india will break pakistan
pakistan will be broken by pakistanis themselves
with so much regionalism factionism and infiltration what else can you expect
time has proved that jinnah did not do good to the indian muslims
yasmin chicago
madam if work was continued in jinnahs manner neither would the tumors of regionalism factionism and infiltration have spread in pakistan nor would the indian muslims been treated in this way
but its our fault that we could not bring up a leader like his stature
but if we cant appreciate our heroes then
this region has great capabilities
god knows when well understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity
in both countries the mullahs pundits taliban shiv sena and the rss etc have been established to oppose the peace process
and the evil powers dont want this region to progress therefore these countries are controlled like puppets
can you imagine what status will this region of pakistan india and china will have in the world
pakistan is cursed by god for having robbers and thieves as their appointed leaders
may allah protect our country from any harm amen
but sir open your eyes and look around and see the current situation and ground realities that reveal the extent to which the american have progressed
moreover the internal affairs dont seem to be good as you can see the circumstances in nwfp balochistan and in karachi in sindh
in this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation
o allah have mercy on us
i believe we have no other option but to go to war one last time
enough is enough
its now or never
these false acts of cooperation will not solve the problem
and not through small scale terrorism in each others country
afterall even europe was founded after the last world war
and if there had not been a great war then they would still be fighting back and forth like pakistan and india
almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be finished
but our military leadership does not seem to be sincere in these regards on the one hand america and europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism and on the other hand we secretly help the taiban
we have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way thank you
there is no doubt that the majority of the movement league are from the tayaba group who joined the league after the inception of pakistan
however after that more focus was diverted towards humanitarian activities and now on indias strong request the united nations has also banned it and the government of pakistan has also implemented a crack down on this organization
in my opinion it is better if jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities
the terrorist organizations present in pakistan are employing professional criminals in the name of jihad the mentors of these and the mullahs are the same people who called pakistan paleedistan and what not from time to time
now they are not leaving any stone unturned in destroying pakistan
in reality they do not even deserve to be called human beings let alone muslims
without cleaning pakistan of these mischief mongers the national security will remain at risk
can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous or not
there is no place in this world for extremist mullahs whose only purpose is to kill
this news breaks my heart to pieces
what kind of world is this where it is hard to live for one who takes the name of one major pillar of islam religion of allah
non muslims can kill muslim but if muslim even tries to take revenge then along with the whole non muslim world our hypocrite leaders also treat the ones sincere with true and sincere religion like they are treating our great leader hafiz saeed now a days
as a penalty of mumbai attacks india
pakistan relation are bitter better relationship as a result of last few years between the two countries have been jolted greatly
india has always claimed that militant and nonmilitant groups which are active in pakistan were responsible
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the action against these groups
whereas indian security agencies have accused lashkaretaiba of being directly responsible for the mumbai attacks
in this way many times jamat ul dawa names came up
this is the first time that relation between both the countries have worsen due to a terrorist activity in india
in december 2001 after the attacks on indian parliament these two neighbors were on the brink of war
after that in 2002 lashkr e taiba was banned and was included in terrorists list
now jamat adawa to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of lashkr e taiba is demanded to be banned
in your opinion should this group be banned or not
should pakistan take decisive action against active extremist groups on her soil
can by banning jamat adawa present india
pak crisis to subside and how important is it for permanent peace between the two countries that armed groups be dismantled
security council of the united nations has banned jamatuddawa after all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly
does the security council always show this type of urgency against the muslims
this we say as accuser is weak and witness is strong
india itself has become a failed government
whose intelligence army and security institutes failed and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours and india wants to put the blame for its inability on pakistan to fool the whole world
if one disbeliever dies then the whole world knows about it why is this double accuracy
to the dear nation of one nonpolitical religious farming organization
furqan farooq faisalabad
our prophet (directives for) scholars and all the saints love the people and gave respect to them islam remains a peaceful religion
the muslims also got promoted in every field
when this beautiful religion has came to a normal person then the human beings has started differentiating the muslim and non muslim and then the new chapters of tumults and quarrel has been started earlier the world was not aware of this
do greet them sir but at your own expense
do not do it under the pressure from america
if india is aggrieved it should provide the evidence
why does it not give
why do they blame everything on us
there are extremist groups and organizations in india as well why dont they put sanctions on them
are we the only terrorists in the world
what india is doing in kashmir what is that
what israel is doing what is that
the truth is that we are the first islamic nuclear state why is what the fight is about
pakistan is now in the last stages
kamran hassan abu dhabi
your talk touches the heart and circumstances also seems to be such
now american magazines are very boldly printing the new map of pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be the part of this conspiracy
american are not slowly but now very swiftly tightening there grip over pakistan
in this situation if we do not stand together and show our unity then remember if bangladesh can be made then anything can happen
terrorist attacks should be condemned to the maximum whether they are on the mumbai hotel or the marriot hotel in islamabad or in palestine
similarly terrorists should be hunted down irrespective of their nationality and whether they are pakistani indian american or israeli
now the question is that why the whole world including the pakistani officials are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in pakistan resulting in the death of hundreds of people
was the attack carried out on marriott hotel was not a terrorist attack
then why
appreciation for interior advisor rehman malik masha allah he has become very brave
not only this but according to bbc mr malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under someoness pressure
praise the lord
whether having the ability or not or to say that i dont want
whose war we pakistanis are fighting
and why we have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect
no one has the right to interfere in any countries affairs
apparently colonial period does not seem to exist
if people expect justice or demand that an external united court be established respect democratic institutions and not help any dictator or army man there will be peace in the third world including pakistan which i think is not acceptable by those calling for unity
pakistan is always following european and american purposes
pakistan is forced to do so despite a majority of its population oppose it
this enhances the opposite or anti sentiments
if america and its allies believe in democracy they should give up their colonial behavior and leave this region
pakistan has ability to arm or disarm
security forces searched a camp of lasharitayba in pakistan administered kashmir
pressure is being increased on pakistan for taking rapid action against extremist organizations after mumbai attacks
india blames that lasharitayba has role in mumbai attacks
she says that no doubt the extremists responsible for mumbai attacks used pakistani soil
meanwhile the officials in peshawar has told that more than 50 trucks have been burnt by some unknown armed persons these trucks were going to afghanistan with goods for nato forces
it is the second attack on neto and american supplies during 48 hours in peshawar
during this pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned lashkr e taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from karachi to tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action
the question is does pakistan want to do it
is pakistan capable for this
what do you say
click here for details
note due to higher numbers only comments typed in urdu will be published
for this press altshift on onscreen keyboard and select urdu
i have only one question from all humanitarian leaders
if you kill their children and they bring necklace for you this is impossible
and question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies say any logic argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men laborers and poor workers of different occupations in revenge of american attack
if your answer is no then you need to correct your point of view
people were armed at that time their was a danger that russia will turn toward pakistan after afghanistan therefore people were armed
now when there is the danger of american attack via afghanistan of which current american president clearly expressed in his presidential campaign then why should we disarm these people
only for this that after defeating pakistani army america or india may not face any public resistance
yes if any of them are involved in terrorist activities then only pakistan should take action against them
but the sad fact of the matter is that leaders of lashkare tayyaba declared the accusations of india correct that pakistan was involved
najeeb ur rehman psycho lahore
even if we accept that lashkaretaiba is guilty it is still not correct to blame the pakistani government
one more question is this that this terrorists has not received any help from a government or non government indian
are terrorists only born or prepared in pakistan and not in any other country of the world
as far as laskaray taiba has concerned they did not involve to this recent terror
it must be remembered that hafiz saeed is the first jehadi leader who called the taliban actions mischief
i am sure that the taliban effect is a inseparable result of american plans and hence every person who can stand in the way of taliban must be removed
the operations started with american and saudi funding has to come to an end and to do so it should be requested of them that for god sake wipe out this filth that is consistently polluting our society
one should also protest against them that according to what ethics america and saudi arabia distributed dangerous weapons and named jihadis but in the reality spread the virus of hateful literature and culture due to which slaughter houses were open in our country
after the threat of an attack from the indian side an announcement from the pakistan army that they would pull their troops from the afghan border and would commit them towards india and a declaration from taliban that they would take care of the afghan border staggered the americans badly and thus put all their weight behind pakistan against an indian attack
this exposed the might of the american army in the region
although india did not even threatened nor it has the guts to
the remaining damage is done by the taliban by attacking the american convoy
thus it was proved that without the help of pakistan government and army america would achieve nothing
karachi business financial center of pakistan is dubai of underdeveloped areas
hundreds of thousands never return from here empty handed but ever since the law and order situation in the western border regions was lost all people diverted their attention here
now they are about to kidnap this city
for the first time pathans are called pashtoons they are made to fight by making them strangers to each other although the need is to be united
one solution of the problem is that the urdu speaking people learn pushto or the pushto speaking learn urdu or if everyone learns english the better
you must be thinking its a funny suggestion but dont you think the cause of the conflict is also funny
that the cause of extremism be language
zaheer chughtai
sir in my childhood i had actually given the same suggestion many times to my friends which included people from every religion and rhetoric groups but my friend people used to laugh over these suggestions
at that time these ethnic and religious sentiments of hatred were not so strong they were merely boiling inside
do not understand what and why is this happening
are these the signs of the day of judgement
for what crime are innocent people being killed
the reason is in front of everyone ones who want to break pakistan into pieces are active and those who do all this neither belong to any religion nor a country
whether it be karachi or mumbai the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns
when the government comes they just change names of the places to build a name for themselves just like these days airports roads buildings are all named benazir
does benazir mean that which is happening to the public of karachi and pakistan
when bombay attacks were at their peak the failure of efforts of ra to initiate turmoil in karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of ra have now resigned from their posts
unjustified killing of pashto speaking hard workers and indian threats have awaken sleeping pakistanis from karachi to khyber
where reaction full of patriotism of all political religious lingual and national parties have taught diplomatic manners to india at the same time they have also given american planners one more chance to think
mqm and anp are responsible for the worse situation in karachi and administration is not neutral
administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately
police and rangers dont take action because of political parties pressure
the talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches the political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man
until there is pressure on the administration these kind of incidents will keep taking place
i think these people are the biggest terrorists
and foreign powers are definitely involved in this but no one knows who they are
but alas that if these incidents were in any city of nwfp then what would the government have done over there but since its not in nwfp the government seems to be helpless
government should do an operation here and save countrys big and an important city
otherwise pakistan will face a huge financial crisis
bbc urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure and pakistani medias condition is already weak
the whole truth is available on bbc english
one solution to the problem is that either urdu speakers should learn pushto or pushto speaking learn urdu or better if every body learns english
you will definitely take is as a funny suggestion but dont you think the cause of the conflict is also funny
that language is the reason of violence
there was another story of cruelness recorded in karachi terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time
no one left any stone unturned and the reports that surfaced in the media was 50 of what actually happened here in four days
i stayed up the last three nights and i am still afraid
who evacuated hotels killed cobblers peanut sellers
the people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of allahs punishment which can catch them anytime
in your opinion what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance
(bbc)
keeping in view the gruesome bloodshed event in mumbai we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in karachi it is simple and easy to guess that the turmoil is just due to an unconcious trade of blood
it is obvious that if someone mistreats the father it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control
the blood of the loyalists of liaqat ali khan also belonged to the same place but to eliminate mr psychos misunderstanding i am writing this verse
we will also repeat our elders traditions
they gave their lives to build we will give our lives to save
faizan tauseef siddiqui
it is very sad the whole country is at stake while we are fighting with each other
mr siddiqui in wikipedia
org is searched for liaqat ali khan you will know that he belonged to a noble punjabi family of an area of punjab karnal
due to his steps for the migrants today the migrants consider him as one of them
every action has a reaction
you can tolerate till your own but
ijaz awan
sir before you gather a huge crowd very quickly i should tell you that you are finding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters
we have been bearing both kinds of misbehaviour
mischief mongers did not leave pakistan or the founder of pakistan they did not have to face any reaction
on the contrary we are writing our hearts on the chest of pakistan
only muslim league (n) was left she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to peoples party
before this mqm and muslim league (q) has already submitted the draft of 18th amendment in assembly and senate
till now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved
this is the reason why no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change
it seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment these parties have done their part that is they will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft government speaker did not take any action
mqm the government muslim league n in the opposition and muslim league q was the party who passed 17th amendment so how is it possible that these parties will be sincere in finishing the 17th amendment
this is the way to get ones name entered in the list of martyrs by just getting painted
peoples party is not what so ever in a hurry to remove 17th amendment
how any one can think of getting his own hands cut
as long zardari is president 17th amendment will be there
this was the opinion of the majority in our survey and it is also true
if the seventeenth amendment was to be cancelled then zardari would never had become the president
now he is even more powerful that president musharaf as along with being the president he is also the chairman of the peoples party
till he is president 17th amendment is there
in order to cancel the seventeenth amendment the political parties will first have to dismiss president zardari from the presidency
neither mqm wants this nor other parties
most elders of our family belonged to labor class
in our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor work we used to pray to allah that please save us from this hard labor work
to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily amroz and asked him what should we do after matriculation so that we dont have to do labor work
editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study
from the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology
but at the time of admission in fsc my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing fsc in medical
we hardly studied biology for a month before we started studying maths
means that the fear from labor work made me an engineer and now i am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which i am always thankful to god
this we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons
we said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor
the son said that i am studying and will continue studying but i cannot do this work
any how we three managed to complete the work within three hours and returned home
the point of saying is that if a person picks his destiny whatever is the reason behind it no one can stop him from achieving that destiny
but if you dont even know what you have to do then god be with you
it is said that do not say bad about the dead but what shall we do we see only bad things in benazir even on her first death anniversary
on one side benazir crushed independence movement of sikhs by handing over the list of sikh freedom fighters to india for her own sake and on the other hand provided india an opportunity to fully concentrate in kashmir after crushing the movement in punjab
the greed of benazir and nawaz sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years
during her exile benazir continued to give negative statements on kashmir and atomic program
benazir violated the london agreement with nawaz sharif and made a deal with general musharaf
during her rule benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make as much money that is why he is known as mr ten percent
during benazirs rule his brother got killed but his murderers are still safe from any punishment
despite being a woman benazir avoided fighting for women rights
just like benazir did her politics over her fathers dead body similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body
benazir came into power twice but she could not punish her the culprits of her fathers political murder even she couldnt register a case against them
it is 37 years since east pakistan was separated from us and look at the height of insensitivity on the part of the public and the rulers that no one ever mourned or expressed sorrow over their mistakes
what should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated 16th december as a didactic day and take such measures that this kind of incident dont take place again
on this day we could send greeting to the people of bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again
rulers open the file of mehmoodulrehman commission in order to study the reasons for the separation of east pakistan
he would plan on bringing back the people of bihar who were stuck in bangladesh and he would send them gifts to keep their spirits up
we have become so insensitive that if someone dies in our neighborhood we are not even aware of it
we do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish
even after big tragedies we return to our routine life the next day
only if east and west pakistan could be one together just like east and west germany was united once again
we can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness
but this wish does not seem to be fulfilled in the near future
when it was announced in the news today that the governor of the american state illinois was arrested for corruption charges
to remove him from the office of governor state congress is preparing to start trial against him as soon as possible one of our friend who has keen eye on the current affairs of pakistan proudly said that this is democracy
no one is beyond the law in america
and there is your country whose president was made after he had the corruption charges dropped
my sense of humor rouse and i said whats strange if a governor has been arrested in america in our pakistan prime minister was arrested overnight and once was hanged and second time was exiled
tell me when it happened in america
in pakistan those who broke the law were sent out of the presidential palace with a guard of honor tell me when this happened in america
in pakistan chief justice has been dismissed as despite of public support he is not reinstated yet has this ever happened in america
in pakistan fake degree holder has become the health minister did this happen in america
after hearing all this the american went down laughing and then conceded defeat
in this picture president zardari is smiling despite of being surrounded by the americans from all four sides
it looks from his smile
he thinks that america is with his government he is forgetting that one year ago they were with pervez musharraf
this picture has been taken as it was a family gathering
a photo like this was never published in the papers before one president with three american officials
it seems as if americas work in pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one
it is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of president zardari breaking his promises
if it had been a sensible ruler at least he would not have been grinning during the photo session and he would have had a subservient and embarrassing look on his face
if democracy principle applied on this picture than president zardari is in minority
according to democracy the majority are the rulers of the country and the photo is speaking for itself who that is
paradiselike swat is also called the switzerland of pakistan
till now according to government policy cross talks are also going along with the power use
but the use of force is not giving any benefit other than increasing the force of the taliban and increasing the public favor for them
instead of using power government should find out the real causes of the problem
with the root causes addressed fazalullah and taliban will die out themselves
the sharia bill proposed by anp will become the solution of the problems of swat to a great extent
but the government must address the financial problems in addition to the implementation of shariat
from the early steps of general musharaf it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians but the lust of power changed all his plans
and whatever steps were expected were no more
as soon as bushs era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment he made a deal with the thieves
even then general musharaf could control the army but never know whats happening to the present government
despite the military operation in swat a wartorn area of nwfp things are getting worse
on one hand the writ of govt is limited to a resolution of condemnation passed by national assembly while on other hand the influence of talibans fm channel is increasing in swat
on the third side the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region
the security forces claim killing many extremists during gunship helicopter attacks and artillery bombardment but in spite of these killings the talibans has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of swat
as a result on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat and on the other hand the taliban is stronger
who is stuck in between the poor civilians
it is said that in swat somebody asked which type of people are the talibans are the answer was very good people because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country
then asked how is army the answer was that the army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country
then it was asked who are the enemies of religion and country the answer was the citizens
i am astonished how the pakistan army will fight with the indian army while it is unable to control a small group of talibans
they could not track the illegally set up fm channel of the taliban which i believe was very easy
but still the fm channel is spreading poison with all vigor
after the girls schools now boys schools are being destroyed
curfew is imposed so that tablibans can move around easily
tonight 8 trucks entered the suburbs of mingora during curfew and created bunkers
question arises how did they reach there during curfew
the army could kill akbar bugti in his house but salutes the taliban
for god sake someone tells this army to protect helpless people of sawat from taliban and prove that pakistan army can overcome any enemy
he has said that religion is the reason of bloodshed kindly tell me if it would be a peaceful world without any concept of religion
are punjabi pathan white black mahsood and other tribes the result of religion
no sir no way only religion teaches that there is no black and white there is no punjabi and no immigrant if it were not for religion then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between the white and the black and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribebrotherhood hatred
actually religion gives moral teachings to the man and binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here and he should spent his life according to his rules
as a muslim i have total faith that islam is complete way of life and a true religion
after settling down in london every morning i would first call my relatives and ask them how they were most of them had never called me to find out how i was doing and i then realized that they do not like me calling them either so i stopped calling them
living here in france for two years i also felt the same way
i do not know why people only expect us to call
resolution about iraq passed in a few hours sending un peace force to darfur is not a problem
immediately criticizing the mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours
and where there is a matter of death we are still holding meetings about that
o upholders of world peace life is finishing over here
is the wait really going on for it to finish
so that any again no aggrieved could even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights
when a father is running carrying his beloved sons dead body even then your hearts dont pinch you with pain
if no then you have no right to be called a human being
but you are a shame to the name of humanity
it has been proved that this area is from thousands of years is also israelis country
ideally these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection but since their strings are in the hands of the western and arab countries therefore peace is not possible without their will
and now even iran wants to fight its proxy war from here
even if israeli action has stopped for a while it will start again after some incident
the interest of the owner of bbc is associated with serving america and israel and this is why in the name of enlightenment it has come out with a series of zionist favoring blogs and is doing a biased and blind propaganda
bbc is only carrying the formality and its objective is to have sympathies
it is requested to mr moderator that he must publish this review so that it may be proved bbc has element of realism to some extent
thanks
i dont know who wrote this story or how this story came to being but one thing is for sure in every age draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people
in every time and are being wars and every time blood is running
but the surprising thing is that this 21st century man who considers himself civilized is quiet over this ruthless open massacre
how does he not feel that what is happening around is a distortedworst face of humanity

sometimes every drop is like pain
even these rains are from you
all these leaders are going to run away with their briefcases in hand what do they care about what will happen to the country
the people should they sell their possessions or be wiping clean the temples with lemon peals
for one our media is also corrupted like our leaders
its sole purpose is to extract money from the government
people are illiterate he was talking about it is the biggest ignorance to
yesterday noon strange thing happened
all police are running here and there but dont ask about illegal parking
moreover traffic nypd was also not in the mood to look at the illegally parked vehicles
something like this happened that a plane of the us air really became a ship and landed in the hudson river
till now it is just known this that terrorists relation was with birds race goose
yesterday was perhaps historic cold in new york
the temperature does not fall this much
pain started in my own jaw after walking outside for half an hour
just imagine what would have happened with those who jumped of the plane into the river
it is a matter of happiness that all people were safe
and it was sad that the companies plane drowned during this financial crisis
while watching all this i went to new jersey by west side highway i noticed that south bound is blocked still what i did

for no reason we thought that the taliban group from sawat was non religious who were only against women education
they were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day
but like majority of the ideas this was not proven right also according to this news of cnn on the lucky day of monday a group of taliban demolished a boys school with gunpowder
swat the taliban has destroyed a boys school
the girls schools were already destroyed acting according to the famous english saying ladies first i do not know why people are still bent on calling the taliban uncultured and barbaric
another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the taliban that they are against girls education is not true
not this but the wonderful that they are against total education
may allah give these mujahideen more power and the evil government
which is let loose on us may he help them in uprooting them
sometime before this a girl was married to a dog
lets see that groom
humanity is rare in 21st century
today is the age of computer and computers interference is growing in every aspect of life
many people have objections over interference of computer as its role in financial matters
where use of credit card bring ease to life it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life
now the record of financial matters can easily be tracked by using credit card
and in future when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent its benefits will increase more and more
similarly in crimes world there is no need to rob the bank information of credit card are hacked
similarly computers have become the source of friendship
social networking sites like orkut facebook and myspace are at first level of acceptance
but do you not think that the more we are following these social networking sites the further we are getting from people in real life
similarly there is the website of match making where by knowing your choice you are provided with a list of people according to your likings
now can you spend your life with a person like you
i cant do it that is why a life partner is known as better half
that heshe may cover my deficiencies
perhaps i received a lesser share of wisdom
from childhood i thought of everything as being true if it was told by an elder
in the same way i was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world
i used to get laughed at a lot for this
but only that saying seemed true which could be possible
become much irritation because what was the reason to tell lie
even suffered in this part of my age because of this
it is always my wish to speak lie as less as i can
i refrained from giving false hopes to others particularly with allahs name
and only say god willing when it was my wish that the work was to be done
besides allah knows what is there in the hearts
this is a disgusting problem which is created due to reason of distance from religion
according to our religion and the law of pakistan minor should stay with their mother
there expenses are on the father and father can meet them
then when the kids become mature they can decide with whom they want to live
you rightly mentioned that the actual problem is that of the relatives who mislead
jagirdar thinking on all of our deeds exercises
it is this very factor in effect over here that there will be new shareholders in the fathers property born and they will go against him otherwise his fathers action is commendable
here these restriction regarding making of relations have created many evils in the society
concept of marriage of a divorced or a widow is ending
these absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason family breakups
in our society if the wife of a 5055 year old man or the husband of such a wife passes away why are they not looked at in a nice manner
near us there is a pakistani uncle whose wife passed away 1012 years ago now after marrying off all his children he has married a widow so even his children have gone against him
in my opinion this is religious right what do you say
to take place of our mother in the being of our mother what kind of thinking
i believe that this persons children should have thought what is wrong if he married a widow after he married off all his children
in this way this widow women has also got some support and that uncle will also get some one to take care of the home (homemaker)
because his children would certainly be busy in their worldly affairs and would not be having time for him
the reason for this is ignorance
this is a result of the force of society
childeren feel ashamed on the second marriage of their father when people make jokes of such family on this action
where as they must face the circumstances and say that what their father didit was just according to islam
this is a curse in our society in which we are sunk since last 40 to 50 years
it is acceptable for a wife that her husband does unlawful actions but she does not let him marry another woman
if its in her power she will not let him do so even after she dies
destroys her afterlife along with her husbandsand also lets spreading of the immorality in the society
chanting islam islam does not mean anything in reality we like only our culture and traditions
like demotivation for the girls education and love marriage etc
as for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt)
in the indian subcontinent we accepted islam centuries ago but we could not let go of this illiterate thinking and always thought of culture and tradition as more valuable than islam
second marriage of man as ridiculous divorce as stigma divorced woman as untouchable love marriage as disgrace and mans marriage with an elder woman as the result of her cunningness is all because of such thinking
and over all by copying the western world we are declaring the religious and veil as old fashioned
accepting islam was easy getting rid of this way of thinking is very hard
allah bless us all the courage for it
amen
writing urdu was never that difficult
centuries passed in writing this little
consider more to less
allah hafiz
but here the situations are different here
to say that common people are there to die for us if we die then martyr
if someone from common people dies then murder
may allah bless and have mercy on you
when i was coming back to the shop after isha prayer tonight one man who was sitting in car raised his hand and asked me to come
i thought that probable this man has lost his way or wants to ask something i stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car
he asked whether i could understand arabic well or not i said no problem tell me what you want
he started telling that he has come from riyadh and here in medina someone picked my pocket kindly help me i said please go away brother since such an incident has already taken place with me that i gave this man 12 riyals so that he could reach riyadh but he started doing the same after moving a little farther
i got very angry and scolded him and warned him that i would call the soldiers so he got very frightened
now the situation has become that we muslims come on cars with our families to beg throughout the day and gain at least two or three thousand illegally
whereas there is a clear hadith of the prophet (saws) that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand the lower hand being the begging hand and the upper hand being the giving one
may allah have mercy on us and make us true muslims (amen amen)

wife of famous singer adnan sami reached a police station in bombay accusing him of torturing her
the police station advised her to contact a court
saba galadari the wife of adnan sami gave an application against her husband that adnan sami continuously tortures her
and that he treats her in a nonhuman manner
now this thing has gone out of her tolerance therefore a case may be registered against adnan sami
the police instead of filing a case told her to contact a court saying that this matter was not one in which the police could put their hands
in your opinion is the accusation of adnan samis wife on him is correct
can this accusation is an attempt of india to defame adnan sami
let us know about your opinion on this issue
adam sanghar mehr
as far as the allegations are concerned anyone can levy them on any other person
there is nothing superior to honor
whatever be the case between adnan sami and his present wife he had left his honorable life and went to india to earn money now that fame has fallen around his neck
this is the result of his own actions
high ambassadors of america say that president obama will take a strong stand against afghan president hamid karzai
on this new policy of america about afghanistan give more importance on war instead of development
the envoys say that hamid karzai is being considered a barrier in the achievement of american goals in afghanistan as there is corruption in the government and the business of middlemen has increased and the taliban are once more gathering strength
american officials say that people who are putting more pressure on hamid karzai to do more include vice president joe biden and president obamas representative for afhanistan and pakistan richard holbrooke
he said that this policy appeared after president bush who used to video conference with hamid karzai every two weeks left he used to stress upon the american role in rebuilding afghanistan and its civilian institutions
officials say that the obama government would work with the state leaders rather than the central government
officials say that they will emphasize hamid karzai on fighting against corruption
hamid karzai is facing fresh elections this year and it is not yet clear whether obama and his group will support karzai for presidency or not
this statement of the american officials is not a precursor for a change in the american policy towards afghanistan is it
is hamid karzais era coming to an end
what is your opinion about this
malik babar hussain it is sad that such customs of ignorance still exist in this modern age these feudal target the poor and innocent people who will believe that they are muslims

all this is done by these people kashmir is fighting for its freedom from past 60 years
no no one asked and they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism so they start talking about making up
first they openly killed the muslims now they are in the efforts of setting things right
anyways pakistan should understand their double policies
asad khan london
india is creating such a situation that the worlds attention can be diverted from kashmir
but pakistan has always shown the real face of india to the world
now the british government is also understanding that the indians are taking cover from their occupation over kashmir by blaming pakistan of terrorism
they are unwilling to talk with pakistan on this matter
british foreign minister david miliband said that by resolving kashmir issue will end extremism pakistan government will be able to handle the border issues
it should be noted that recently the newly elected american president obama has also expressed similar thoughts on the kashmir issue
the british foreign minister while talking to media in mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president bush
david milliband said that pakistan should not have any soft corner for the extremist groups
due to insistance of major powers to resolve kashmir issue india is creating unrest in the region to distract world from this issue
isnt the terrorism in mumbai a part of this strategy
does india want to avoid the comprehensive talks by on the basis of terrorism
let us know of your opinion
usman aftab
i think the big powers do not want to harm pakistan
in fact are thinking of means to control pakistan they know pakistan is an atomic power
they want to bring about some kind of revolution here
foreign countries are only thinking that if they corner pakistan they would face some political and geographic problems they want to help pakistan but also want to be successful in their goal
a citizen usa
it has always been hindus tradition walking stick in arm and name of ram (hindu god)on lips
i think that they get problems often in a while and they start threatning pakistan

the prime minister syed raza yusuf geelani said that the newly elected american vice president joe biden played an important role in removing the expresident musharrafs uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy which is why the pakistani government has honored him with a special star
no political party can get the credit of uniform shedding and the restoration of democracy parliament is not a rubber stamp
all decisions will be made in the parliament

american president george w bush in his outgoing press conference advised newly elected president barack obama saying that he had made many mistakes in his presidency and that barack obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate
i as the president and according with the constitution of usa and law i did the developments i put forward american interest on my own popularity
he said that the enemies of america are still planning to attack america and that the biggest challenge for barack obama would be to stop those attacks
he said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in iraq was the biggest disappointment for him and considering the iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake
in the last conference at white house he said that this is my last press conference and i thank to all those who have attended

this is very hurtful incident that israel is publicly massacring the palestinians same situation is here in kashmir but security council do not even bother by it
all the organisations present in palestine and kashmir should keep their war going until they gain independence and they should form unity among themselves and keep facing any type of harm and one day or the other their martyrdom will give fruit god willing
israeli air attacks are still continued on gaza hundreds of palestinian men women and children have been martyred
the important political person of hamas nazariyan has killed along with his family
there meeting of security council ended without any decision
the meeting saw american opposition to the derogatory resolutions passed against israel by libya and other arab countries
from the last few days there has been bombing by israeli planes on the palestinian civilian population
every country around the world began to protest against the mumbai attacks but cant anyone see this brutality including america and britain
why are the major muslim countries quiet
what will you wish to say on this double standard of the world

i think the actual point that the majority of our nation in illetrate they even dont know where their money is going to government is interested in applying taxes and fullfil their duties electricity and gas shortage will remain same
because everyone knows about the character of those who have been elected by our own nation
crisis of electricity and gas all over pakistan has become a critical state
on the other hand gas prices have been raised by average 8 while in few cities unavailability of petrol created immense worry for people
intense reactions riots and torturous demonstration are continued in the industrial and business circles of pakistan against the crisis of electricity and gas
the producers have given the ultimatum to close the factories
in karachi people are worried due to 8 to 10 hours load shedding
industrial activities have almost paralyzed
government institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other
are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas not a joke against the nation
why is attention not being paid to solve the problems
is government not seeing the full stop on national development
what immediate steps can you suggest to gain control over this crisis

the indian government has stopped the indian cricket team from visiting pakistan
the indian cricket team had to play three tests five one day matches and one 20 twenty on pakistan tour
the vicepresident of the indian cricket board rajeev shukla who spoke to the news said that the board has asked the government to allow the pakistan tour but because of the serious matters between the two countries this tour is not possible
is the indian governments initiative not to allow the cricket team to visit pakistan on grounds of political reasons justified cant sports be kept aside from politics
is the indian governments decision not harmful for cricket
even though the security in india was poor the english cricket team tour was going on so why dont the indian team do the pakistan tour

salman karachi
people who feel proud on going to india
and they make their films and videos over there their eyes should open now as to how much the people of india respect you
i remember an interview of adnan sami in which he said that he is not pakistani national but a british
adnan sami should come back to pakistan at the first opportunity because he did not get honor there either
fareed ahmed
karachi
indians attitude have changed after mumbai attack
jagjit singh has showed his reaction in this way that he hates pakistan and pakistani
it should be known that adnan sami has sung with asha bhonsle and how has he become helpless now adnan sami should stay in india there is no need for him to come here
muhammad shamshad aalam
karachi on the statement of jagjit singh i would only say that he changes color like a chameleon
who gives statements suitable to situation pakistanis open your eyes that how much you are given worth in india understand the thinking of hindu
after the mumbai incident their hate filled speech has increased now they are spreading poison about famous singer adnan sami
after that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards bush president bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself
the second shoe hit the american flag
security personnels dragged the journalist away from there
on this occasion president bush said i dont know why he did this shoe was of size 10 i was not bothered
do you think that this action by the journalist depicts the anger of iraqi people against president bush
what do you say about this incident
after the terrorists attacks on mumbai the tension between india and pakistan relations worsen when fighter planes of indian air force violated the air space limit of pakistan in lahore and kashmir sectors
due to the reaction of the pakistani air force the indian planes were forced to go back
according to sources both indian planes were full of weapons and ammunition
in the current tensed situation it is the first incident of its own kind
pakistan air force says that air force is fully vigilant to defend the country
federal minister of information sherry rehman has stated that the indian leaders have acknowledged the violation of pakistani airspace however this happened by mistake
pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious
do you think india really intends to launch an air attack on pakistan
is indias claim is correct that this violation was a mistake or it was objected to measure the capability of pakistan air force
not this incident will increase tension between the two countries
