the role of european union for the peace in middle east
from official point of view the role of european union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the middle east
according to brussels official stance the efforts of schwarzenberg delegation or sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard
european unions spokesman amadeu altafaj has said that every such effort is adorable which is helpful in sending the european unions message to the opponents of the war
it seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned
but in reality the european union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions
as the head of the union czech republics role is even weaker than before
an on top of that the internal issues have made is helpless
on the other hand the french president sarkozy is behaving like if he is still the president of the european union
whereas france has completed its presidential tenure of six months
sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it
the most funny situation is faced by the french foreign minister bernard kouchner
he is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of czech republic schwarzenberg
the problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the middle east war
schwarzenberg says that israel has the right for self defense whereas kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense moreover germany has sent its special ambassador to middle east unless the european union does not show unity based on common stance it can not succeed on the diplomatic front
its proof is the israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the european union
this is a golden chance for the european union to do something since america due to the policies of george w bush has already failed in the middle east
financial crisis suicide of a billionaire german industrialist
adolf merckle a resident of sawabia in southern germany left a huge business group behind him
but a short while ago common german citizens did not know much about it

marclay group had to bear the loss of hundreds of million euros after it bought the shares of one of known industry folks wigan
then the financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed 100 million and 1 billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on marclay
recently the same banks accepted to provide loan to marclay group on urgent basis but adolf marclay who started as a small industrialist to reach a place where his industrial groups annual income reached 30 billion euros couldnt bear the the loss in his financial strength
after the death of his father when adolf marclay took the responsibility of the business he used modern methods and made the business more successful
he named his company ratiopharm which is now germanys most successful and biggest pharmaceutical company
till recent times this phamasutical company had a budget of around 5 to 6 billion euros and even now it is earning around 8 billion euros annually after the great success of rasue farm the marclay group bought many big industries like hidel barag cement a manufacture of construction equipment kassbohrer and other good car maker
marclay group has a employee number of around 100 thousand around the world and among its industries rasue farm has always been given special importance
adolf marclay has said this many times in his life we have been in pharma business since four generations
now the industry is handled by the children and i hope that it continues to work for few hundred years by our family
after the suicide of adolf marclaythe banks have given approval of temporary loan of 400 million euro for his group vem but on this condition that vem have to be sold to rasio farm so that the financial position of this group is improved on long term basis
this way merchlay group will stay as it has always been after the death of adolph merchley

according to the officials unmanned planes dropped three missiles on a house in mir province of north waziristan due to which ten people in that house died

in the state of sarhad the officials have rejected the demand of putting a restriction on girls education
in the state of sarhad the officials have rejected the warning to put a restriction on girls education by the taliban soldiers saying that this announcement is against both law and islam
on sunday the education minister of sarhad state sardar husain babar added that the government will never allow such efforts to succeed
he said that it is the effort of the extremists that the children of our region remain deprived of education
in his words these people try to secretly blow up schools and frighten the boys and girls
talking about the environment of fear and insecurity he said that the local government knows well and wants it to be known that no force can stop the spread of education in the land of the pukhtons
one day ago the taliban soldiers led by moulana fazlullah had demanded the banning of girls from studying in swats educational institutions from the 15th of january
despite the military activity going on in swat during the last one and a half years about 150 educational institutions were destroyed by the militants by the use of explosives and arson
due to the destruction of these educational institutions thousands of girls and boys were deprived of the facility of education

tea an effective cure for breast cancer
according to a new research three cups of tea a day
if taken can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age by more than a third
in a research carried out by the moffitt cancer institute in the american state of florida it was revealed that the risk of occurrence of breast cancer tumors in such women below the age of 50 years
it was also revealed in the research that there was no significant benefit in these regards in the woman aged above 50 who drank three or more cups of tea a day
experts believe that the reason for this is that tea has such ingredients in it which are more effective against specific tumors which generally occur in women below the age of 50
in the moft cancer center situated in tampa city of the state of florida a research was carried out on 5 thousand women who had taken the treatment for breast cancer
the experts compared their medical record and life pattern with that of women who were safe from breast cancer
the experts also found out that on a particular type of cancer lobular tea had shown a great effect and it reduced by 66 percent
almost every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type of it
this type of cancer is more dangerous because it deep inside and is usually diagnosed when it has already spread to a great extent
experts say that by taking at least three cups a day regularly the danger of breast cancer can be reduced in young women
they say that making tea a regular drink in daily life can cause great resistance in the body against breast cancer
in britain every year almost 40 thousand women are diagnosed to have breast cancer
the afghan war is the greatest challenge faced by america gates
american defense minister robert gates has said that the war in afghanistan is the biggest military challenge faced by america
gates will give a briefing today to the senate and parliament over the strategies of the obama regime on afghanistan and iraq wars
gates told the armed services committee of the senate that fight is not the only solution to the afghanistan issue but he added that in order to secure several areas sufficient number of troops is not there and the talibans take advantage of that to carry out their activities
why reduce exercise with the age
new research
exercise at any age is good for health
it energizes your heart reduces the cholesterol level helps in keeping the weight low helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of alzheimer or dementia
unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age
experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it
according to the american medical association several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise
dr patricia palecca of mayo clinic minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity
dr patricia teaches medicine at mayo clinic
she lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age
the team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart
in which the pumping of the blood by the heart its contraction and relaxation was studied
the experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood
they learnt that as people grew old there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart
dr patricia says that as age increases the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear and this affects the ability to exercise
dr garwin cain was also a part of this study
he says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this and this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart
some times blood pressure can cause disorders in hearts functions and heart diseases
if the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard then they can take advantage of the benefits of exercise even with the age
a detailed report in this matter is published in a magazine of american medical association
no chances of an immediate war with pakistan indian army chief
indian army chief general deepak kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with pakistan how ever we are always ready to defend our country and sacrifice our lives for it
he has accused that despite of commitments and international pressure on pakistan as a result of mumbai attacks the infrastructure of terrorism is not only existent but also proactive in pakistan
he said this while talking to the correspondents in srinagar
the indian army chief was on a one day tour to the valley of kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in new delhi administered kashmir and preparation of armed forces on the borders
he was asked a question that according to the media reports pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from india regarding the mumbai attacks what were his thoughts about it
general kapoor said that the decisions of peace or war matters are taken by the political leadership
talking about the alleged terrorism network in pakistan he said that indian army will have to face the forces which are objected to destroy peace and weaken india
he said that 700 to 800 militants are present in indian kashmir almost half of them are foreigners
general deepak kapoor said with the betterment of weather attempts of slander may increase from pakistan and her side of kashmir however india has increased vigilance on borders
he refused the chances of reducing the number of deployed army in indian administered kashmir by saying that no compromise on country security
may allah bless the tongues of the world and may barack become a blessing for the world
though it was not expected still we shall see how this change will work out in our favor with regards to pakamerican relations
and what barack obama who is the result of martin luther kings dreams gives to the world
obamas (whose name has hussein also) oath as a president of america on one hand is historical while on the other hand is a hard test too
not only for him but for all those people who has supported him heartily
this will also be a test for white people majority as it is not easy for them to accept heartily the presidency of black on them
here in southern asia specially muslims who have developed expectation from him must remember that he has been elected as president of america and obama must remember that president of america is practically the president of the whole world
a little while from then a person whose real brothers were brought to america from their own countries wearing the neckband of slaveryand whose blood and sweat watered the roots of the strongest country of the new era today the a representative of that very same targeted lineage will be called the 44th president
many people have many expectations from this man
it is necessary for those who admire him that they do not make unrealistic expectations about him
if obama is even successful in somewhat reducing the hate that is spread on lineage and religion based lines it will be a victory for his admirers
what effect will this change have on south asia and what considerable change can be expected in the american policy in this regards
how will these changes affect pakistaniamerican relations
my sir whether it be obama or someone else the type of policies with regards to the whole world is decided by the multibillionaire influential strong jewish lobby
as for pakistan with regards to the recent mumbai blasts the injurious actions taken by india israel and america has been seen by the whole world
even for a while after pakistan was formed the managing of swat was left to the ruler of swat which had its own army and law
they surrendered their rule to the government of pakistan according to a treaty
but its sad that our governments have treated swat like a step mother
there has been no increase in the number of schools in swat since the rule of the ruler of swat was finished
nor was there any interest in the construction and development over there
the number of girls receiving education in the present rule is many times less than their number in the previous rule
targeting of educational institutes is continued by local talibans in nwfp province of pakistan
most schools are destroyed in swat majority of those are of girls
not only this taliban has announced a ban on girls education
thousands of students (boys and girls) are unable to get education
what do you think by stopping girls education what the taliban want to achieve
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities so far
what do you think the government should do
the question should be that what isi and pakistani agencies will get
because the people of swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the taliban and not to kill them otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that during the curfew how come people can be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing
when the writ of the government is not being let implemented how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities
now the question arises that having an armed force armed with modern weapons modern technologies and intelligence system why the government can not control these few taliban
the only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head that neither their arms end nor they are apprehended
result of the discussion is that taliban with their wrong steps are making it easier for the imperialists
fifteen years before the war was continued in afghanistan
isi used to control the taliban when there was the opposition from the northern alliance which was supported by russia india and iran
then suddenly the situation changed and talibans works came to light
and isi also got an offer of dollars from america so the previous friend became an enemy
now the situation has changed but the war is still going on and those supporting them in pakistan are still russia india and iran
until man realizes what is wrong and what is right he continues to make mistakes
for instance when a thief goes to steal something if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong it is a curse and it will bring punishment and he fears allah that person will not steal
similarly as long as israel does not realize that it is doing wrong and spilling the blood of the innocent and it will receive punishment for that it will continue to play holi with the blood of the innocent people in gaza
greetings
the question is that is war armed resistance and terrorism the solution to problems
if not then what is the magic recipe that will bring out a solution to the problems
this is true that war and extremism do not solve problems but rather it puts blessings in them
palestine afghanistan and iraq should adopt the same model for their development that nelson mandela had used in south africa
that is to struggle character wise and politically more than in an armed manner
from the kashmiris taking part in the elections it looks as if they have accepted this view point
it is the third week of israeli attacks on gaza and the number of deaths have gone close to a thousand
despite worldwide diplomatic efforts to date a ceasefire was not possible
according to another report since the start of attacks on the 27th of december 90000 palestinians have left their homes and moved towards safer locations
here aid groups have accused israel of being careless about palestinian children and said that a whole generation of palestinian children will be victim of grave psychological and emotional difficulties
what do you say
how is permanent peace possible in gaza

taliban should be given a chance
basit peshawar
please wakeup if the taliban start doing the real jihad then who will kill the innocent people
who will burn down the girls schools
who will do kidnapping for ransom or if ransom not paid then blame people of being american agents and hang them on the towers
these taliban have brought such damage to islam that no nation or religion has ever brought
pashtoon rore
kohat pakistan
if the whole muslim world just give a joint threat to attack israel you will see that how upset will its father america be
and immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well
but what can be done where should our muslim leaders bring the courage from
someone tell ahmed nayad to take the first step as he is very popular for his bravery at the bbc forums
the responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on arabs and the muslim world but its and obligation on the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny
this unfortunate incident is bushs worst sin so far
just like in pakistan and india before 30th june or the end of the fiscal year the government institutions are looted the american regime just before its end have given a green signal to israel to do what ever it wants
on one hand america says that effort will be made for ceasefire
on the other hand the united nations is passing resolution after resolution but actionwise neither have done anything there is only one meaning of this and that is that the even the united nations is openly in favor of destroying the muslims
all muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the united nations and should establish their own global organisation
we have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of america and the united nations are seen but the harm is only done to the muslims
what is the use of these vain efforts if bbc does not want to publish anything
where have all the rules of journalism been buried when blood specifically of muslims is spilled the monster of unbiasedness gets onto bbcs back
which considers itself the standard bearer of truth
forget about breaking something on its own the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments
the only difference between you and the jews is that they call themselves jews and martyr the muslims and the likes of you stay among muslims call yourselves muslims and cause muslims
syja786
for a while bbc forums have been making a certain point sometimes while discussing suicide attacks and other times terrorism in india
the most used word in these antiislamic comments is extremism
but who is extremist that you can easily figure out from the above comment
when will our muslims understand that dajjal can not be fought with the sword
looking at the helpless people facing the israel bombings if the heart does not cry tears of blood what coes it do
but the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that we try to use the name of jihad to disfigure the beautiful face of islam
when majority of the palestinians have accepted the existece of israel then what need does hamas have to send rockets into israel or conduct suicide attacks
the conduct of both sides is misanthropist
the action of the united nations and the united states seem to be supporting the israeli wrongdoings
may allah allow the muslim nation to unite amen
and the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism after all they are doing the real work
otherwise is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are
so in this situation in common terms it is called dadageeri which means do what ever you can
that it even hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry
medicines for injured and coffins for the dead are being supplied by the arab leaders and asked that
should the israeli attacks take place
this is the actual problem that the leaders of muslim countries including saudi crownprince are in a false sleep neither they have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities
they should take immediate measures against israel
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to european countries and america but alas they
salam to all brothers and sisters
i believe that in this time of difficulty telling hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans and it is similar to considering them defeated
if israel and its supporters are at the height of their pharoahism soon moses will be born within their house as this is the rule of nature as the steps taken by america and israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the muslims
which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing
abu abdullah pakistan
israel and hamas should enter a truce so that the death and destruction can come to an end
mohammad sarfaraz paris france
absolutely correctly stated
supposing that hamas is 100 on the truth and they are struggling against oppression to become successful in the eyes of allah even then they should know that if a good deed is resulting in the destruction of an established house it is no more a good deed
those who claim to love god love the messenger and love their religion loving mankind is a part of their faith
as if it is the order of allah to evacuate all the people of the book from the face of the earth other than the muslims
najibur rehman psycho lahore pkin
no there are no orders to destroy but to invite them to come to islam
but jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion
these people should be fought with unless they stop these conspiracies but this doesnt mean at all that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering
brothers the only end to the killer of innocent children is destruction
but i ask my friends that the israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past have become so strong today that they dont listen to any one this is because the jews are united
there are no sheas and sunnis there are all just jews and they have developed everything in every field
in contrast what is the condition of 55 islamic countries
they are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death
it is essential that all muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against israel
feroz magsi jhang pakistan
and there is no better strategy that recognize israel learn modern education and means of progress and let the world live in peace and harmony
the muslims have plenty of land and means as well
the need is of proper use
this first most disappointing factor is that hamas and alfateh could not unite
great leaders like yasir arafat and sheikh yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing jihad for the aqsa mosque and this was impossible without removing yasin and arafat from the way
the world is witnessing that how palestine had been scattering after the death of these two leaders
and how the jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip
in 1974 a pakistani prime minister was so worldly trusted that first time in the history he manged to gather all the muslim leaders under one roof with hundred percent attendance
today on his 81st birthday is it a very difficult task that the whole nation promise to not only keep unity in its lines
also while eradicating the differences between other muslims its (the formation of islamic common wealth) mission will be carried forward
its a monster that has gripped palestine for half a century
this monster has many faces
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world
and its other mouths are eating humans in iraq afghanistan iran and pakistan
this monster is most unhappy with islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through islam muslims the perfect religion of muslim and practical islam as the history tells that islam has put giants like abu jehl on the right path
bombing from israeli fighter planes on gaza has continued since 27th of december
more that 3 hundred palestinians have been killed in these attacks
after the arial attacks israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council the united nations has demanded israel and the palestinian authorities to ceasefire
however the israeli authorities say that they will continue operation in gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on israel have stopped
in your opinion is this claim of israel true that its doing all this for defending the sovereignty of israel
is the world community playing its role in such situation
does this aggression has an indirect relation with the coming elections in israel
can any improvement be expected in the situation in middle east after the succession of the newly elected american president barak obama
(kindly note that due to the increase in number of reviews only those typed in urdu will be published

palestine will forever remain a sacred place for muslims and its protection is a must for us

bbc publishes these kind of comments after deep search
after all a neutral impression is to be maintained
although the news from bbc are usually correct but the real thing is the style of the news
what should be pointed out and what news should be given less importance
etc etc
zaheer chughtai
in this art now a days the pakistani electronic and print media specially some urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the grudge of muavia written on them
has said that the united nations which apparently talks of human rights and peace but when it comes to grimness and coercion over muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that hamas should stop the attacks how long this hypocrisy will continue
why is so much oppression being done on the muslims if people such as america stop supporting these jews then allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people and such people can never lead a proper life so if the americans have courage let them stop their support and then see what kind of life they get
the famous just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice and not by being unjust and killing people
if any tribe could be finished by killing their people and if the required results could be obtained then after hitlers steps not only the presence but the rise that the jews are enjoying today could not have been possible
in the words of a poet
oppression is oppression that the more its done the more it is erased
blood is blood that the more it falls the more it gathers
now who can tell who did terrorism
is all this not included in terrorism why does everybody worry only about their own pain
are others not human or is it that the blood of muslims has become so cheap was the blood of this many innocent not red
and why is there no one to send a mourning message from anywhere
i watched the progress of the mumbai incident as if my own house was on fire the sorrow of humans can not be watched and who can not see this sorrow if only muslims would think a bit together
how can words derogate the bodies strewn on the streets helpless innocent faced people injured and soaked in blood
i feel like crying about the helplessness of muslims that on one side people are dying in india and the whole world is climbing onto pakistan without any proof and saying take action or else we will
and on the other side israel is ruthlessly killing muslims and the whole world is silent this is unbearable
there is delay but no darkness with god that too when this darkness comes to pass
danger to israel with america present is a joke
as for elections there is no doubt to gain public support such actions will have to be taken for the sake of power especially in a state like israel as for barack obama history is witness that no american ruler has been able to go against the american policy and nor will they go whether the ruler is white or black he is still a ruler
it appears from the conversation of forum that everyone is grieved over benazir death but as politician her mistakes are not forgotten
it is debatable that benazir died for democracy or for power
if she sacrificed for democracy then why she left democracy in the dictatorship of musharraf for 10 years till she got a deal and american clearance
benazir did not come to pakistan when the stratocracised public needed her unfortunately she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised
when each and every historic personality is being accused there is no one to say any thing over this

how brutal is our nation not only we are blind while writing odes on ourselves and our parties but now we are picking accusing and criticizing every historical scholar and no body is there to say any thing over this
enough of development that we have made
sana khan
few things are ignored just by thinking that nothing can be done of them just like a donkey can not become a scholar by just loading books over it
although after the mumbai attacks there has been a setback in the dialog between pakistan and india however pakistan and india should continue these dialogs
if we talk of war then it will bring loss of humans from both sides
india says that the man caught in the mumbai attacks is a pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to pakistan in urdu but on the other hand when india initially apprehended this extremist they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader point to be noted
first of all mary christmas to mr bhana and to all the christian brothers of the forum
greeting to all friends of the forum mr psycho a raza sister sana sister shahida and mr akram
we do not want the flames of fire but flowers of peace
war itself is a problem
will war give solution to problems
it will bless with fire and blood
will give hunger and exigence
therefore wise humans
its better to avoid war
in yours and ours yards
its better that the glim keeps lightened
the indiaamerica relations have deepened and india knows that when the time comes america will openly betray pakistan
this is also the old history of america
in case of and indian attack america would get its goals and the expense would be on india as well
pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace reconciliation and ceasefire until india is completely destroyed or occupied even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so
this is the islamic history
even before this resolution the pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give
indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the mumbai attacks are making it more clever that effected and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has relaxed its pressure now
while ignoring indias unnecessary bobbery the satisfaction of the united nations and the appreciation from the interpol chief over pakistans efforts is a side effect of indias overwhelming diplomacy
there are no two opinions over this that it is a heinous act
but the question is that when thousands of taliban attacked the house of pir samiullah where and what was the pakistani army doing at that time
should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past one year
every day how many taliban die due to the firing of the thousands of mortar and canon shells they fire
and they stop this fixed operation
the day is not far when in un resolution of army intrusion in pakistan will be approved just like the one against jamat aldawa
first our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and god forbid the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in un
and suppose if this resolution took time to approve then considering the example of america any country will launch the attack at her own
we do not know about the personality and works of pir samiullah
perhaps he was not a revolutionist
as the bodies of comrade che guevara nawab akbar khan bagti dr najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy
they command even after they die
but there is an international game being played over here here they are ruling by scaring the public about beastliness and terror
so that it would be permissible for them saying that if we are not there beasts and wild people will come and capture the government
such actions of the so called islam lovers in the name of religion is extremely disagreeable
the supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of america but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions give it the name of tribal traditions and clearly avoid it
any person with a heart can never accept these beastly actions which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of islam
i think the people of our army have joint these people
this is because when these people move around at least some time will be taken to catch them will only take so much time but forget about getting to that spot even if they were there they escape from there
are these people so brave that they take 50 or 70 people hostage and our army watches like an audience with hand on hand
they are also servants of allah and so is the army
it is clear that something is sinister
malaiyat in the dictator of the age ziyaulhaqqs dictatorship instead of presenting the noble and merciful characters of god an atmosphere of religiophobia was created by the use of many types of narrations of punishments and incidents apart from the incident of the body hanging even the literature and books like what will happen when we die created fear and terror
and these people are only using this fear as a tool or a weapon to gain worldly pleasures and honor
preachers
as you have preached against the fire of hell
it is surprising when it is said that this can not be a work of a muslim
we are either unaware of our own history or we ignore it for some reason
was the attack of yazids forces on medina not the act of christians and the jews
without accepting reality neither the motives can be diminished nor correction can be made
o bbc please stop this dualheaded policy
better than this topic the super hit title shoeing of bush fair or unfair
should have been
tahir choudhry japan
please show some modesty a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression and you are concerned about the topic of the box office
the success of operation sherdil and across the border operation lion heart depends on the fact that in whose favor is the opinion of general public
this act is of american and pakistani agencies and peer sahab is a victim of this conspiracy
all discussions on this forum will now be anti taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined taliban and they are doing what can change the public opinion
i only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day what was the army doing are they only there for targeting the public they even report something like this bombing on taliban residences a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother
did they not know about this mistake
or were they watching the show
we fold our hands and request them to please for gods sake stop this game
after all there is a ruler above you
whether the question asked by bbc is understandable or not it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer for instance no one asked what the army of 30000 in swat went there to do
that the bodies of the taliban who helps the army is left hanging on poles throughout the day
whatever the green footed pakistani government did with the swat public the media including bbc did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality
the pakistani army is putting up a drama
every child in swat is saying that this is a bloody drama
for gods sake stop this drama
these talibans have spoilt the name of muslims
through out the world if muslims dont tell them muslims then why would terrorists are found in their territories
those who become insensitive and people who dont want to work hard take guns and join these groups
be ashamed
its need is neither in any religion nor in any customs
all media including bbc gives thier views about taliban and tribal areas by different resources
but nobody knows what the actual situation is it is we who know about it because we are tribals
in short this is a game in which cia raw musad and our own isi is involvedthere is nothing like taliban or tribal people they are the negative elements created by these institutions who are spoiling the name of islam taliban religous institutes pukhtoon nation and tribals
this move has ashamed all the muslims
i salute mqms altaf hussain and the leadership of anp and ppp who speak against this cancer that is taliban
this cancer is a product of ziaulhaq who died but also destroyed pakistan
but i am hopeful that current leadership will end this cancer
after mumbai attacks india said that some extremists are behind the attacks
pakistan rejecting the accusations said that it will help india in investigation in every possible way
india said that it has given a list to pakistan that has 20 suspected extremists required by india
now pakistan has said that included in the list jaishemuhammads molana azhar masood is not in custody and government of pakistan has no information about him
before that the president of pakistan asif ali zardari refuted the view that wests secret agencies and indian government has given evidence related to mumbai attachs
president zardari has said that it has not been proved that ajmal kasab is a pakistani
meanwhile prime minister manmohan singh has warned pakistan that its relation with india can not improve unless its land is being used for terrorism
and in a latest development the indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to pakistan
should these political instances affect over the sports
what do you see as the future of pakistan and india relations
neither america will break pakistan nor india
pakistan will be broken by pakistanis themselves
what do you expect after so much provincialism sectarianism and mullaism
although jinnah also did not do good to the muslims of india and it has been proven with time
yasmin chicago
madam if mr jinnahs vision was followed neither the cancer of provincialism sectarianism and mullaism had spread in pakistan nor the muslims in india had undergone such behavior
but its our fault that we could not bring up a leader like his stature
if we can not care for our heroes then
this region has great capabilities
god knows when well understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity
in both countries the enemies to peace like mullas pandits taliban shiv sena rss have been raised
and the evil powers dont want this region to progress therefore these countries are controlled like puppets
can you imagine what status will this region of pakistan india and china will have in the world
pakistan is under persecution from god that these thieves bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation
may allah protect our country from any harm amen
but sir open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality you will figure out how far american forces have penetrated
moreover the internal affairs dont seem to be good as you can see the circumstances in nwfp balochistan and in karachi in sindh
in this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation
o allah bestow your mercy upon us
account to my understanding a final war is inevitable
this is enough of it
now it should be do or die
this problem can not be solved through these acts of insincere dialogues
and not through small scale terrorism in each others country
after all europe got settled after the final world war
and if this world war had not taken place then these countries just like pakistan and india would have been clattering
almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be finished
but our military leadership does not seem to be sincere in these regards on the one hand america and europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism and on the other hand we secretly help the taiban
we should think and fix our direction and choose only one way thanks
there is no doubt that majority of the workers of jamaathud dawah are the previous members of lashkaretaiba who joint the group called jamaathud dawah pakistan after lashkaretaiba was rendered inexistent
however after that the members gave preference to social work and now even jamaathud dawah was rendered inexistent by the united nations due to the pressure applied by india and the crackdown being enforced by the pakistani government
i believe that if jihadi groups leave religious fundamentalism and take up social efforts that would be better
the present terrorist groups that bring up criminals in the name of jihad and the elders of these mullas are the same people who used to call pakistan palidistan and who knows what else
now they are not leaving any stone unturned in destroying pakistan
actually these are not even fit to be called human beings let alone muslims
without cleaning pakistan of these mischief mongers the national security will remain at risk
can we still think about whether or not to put a ban on these mischief mongers
there is no place on earth for extremist mullahs whose only work is to cause killings
heart is breaking into pieces on this news
what world is this where it is hard to survive for the one who names an important part of allahs religion islam
non muslims can kill muslim but if muslim even tries to take revenge then along with the whole non muslim world our hypocrite leaders also treat the ones sincere with true and sincere religion like they are treating our great leader hafiz saeed now a days
as a penalty of mumbai attacks india
pakistan relations are affected and the recent improvement of relations between two countries is enormously shocked
india has been continually blaming active armed and unarmed groups in pakistan
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the action against these groups
whereas indian security agencies has directly blamed lashkr e taiba for mumbai attacks
in this regard jamat adawa has also been nominated
it is not the first time that because of any terrorist attack the relation of these two countries are worsen
in december 2000 after the attacks on indian parliament both countries were at the brink of war
after that in 2002 lashkr e taiba was banned and was included in terrorists list
now jamat adawa to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of lashkr e taiba is demanded to be banned
what do you think should this group be banned or not
should pakistan take decisive action against active extremist groups on her soil
can by banning jamat adawa present india
pakistan crisis will vanish and to what extent it is vital to ban armed groups for establishing forever peace between the two countries
the security council of the united nations has passed the ban on jamaathud dawah however what proof did the security council have based on which it showed such urgency
does the security council always show this type of urgency against the muslims
this is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness
if you look at it even india has become an unsuccessful state
whose intelligence army and security institutes failed and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours and india wants to put the blame for its inability on pakistan to fool the whole world
when one disbeliever dies there is hue and cry in the whole world why these double standards
to a non political religious and social organisation of our dear country
furqan farooq faisalabad
as long as our prophet (pbuh) the awliya kiram and the sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect the religion of islam would spread and prosper with peace
muslims have also advanced in every field
but when there was a rise of mullaism in the religion there was a division of people into muslims and kafirs and new avenues of mischief were opened which were not known to the world previously
salam please do it with pleasure but act at your own
do not do it under american pressure
if india is aggrieved it should provide the evidence
why doesnt it give it
and why it accuses us of every thing
there are extremist groups and organizations in india as well why dont they put sanctions on them
are we the only terrorist in the world
what india is doing in kashmir what is that
what israel is doing what is that
the truth is we are the first nuclear muslim state and why this is the main issue
pakistan is now in its last stages
kamran hassan abu dhabi
your words touch the heart and the situation seems so
now in american publications the new map of pakistan is being printed and all these restrictions are now apparent in the series of events
the americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over pakistan
in this situation if we do not stand together and show our unity then remember if bangladesh can be made then anything can happen
terrorist attacks should be condemned to the maximum whether they are on the mumbai hotel or the marriot hotel in islamabad or in palestine
similarly terrorists should be hunted down irrespective of their nationality and whether they are pakistani indian american or israeli
now the question is that every day terrorist attacks take place in pakistan hundreds of people die but the pakistani officials along with the rest of the world stay silent
wasnt the attack on the marriot hotel an act of terrorism
then why
hale to the advisor for interior rehman malik how brave and bold has the gentleman become
not only this but according to bbc mr malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under someoness pressure
wow all praise to the almighty
whether having the ability or not or to say that i dont want
we the pakistanis are fighting whose war
and why we have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect
no one has a right to interfere anyones national affairs
the colonial system is apparently not there
if people expect justice or demand that an external united court be established respect democratic institutions and not help any dictator or army man there will be peace in the third world including pakistan which i think is not acceptable by those calling for unity
as such pakistan is always following the goals set by europe and america
this happens despite the opposition of a majority of the pakistani population
and this causes more opposing feelings
if they trust america and the united republics then let them leave the style of new populations and let them work on those lines upholding the sovereignty of the state
pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm
security forces raid an alleged camp of banned lashkr e taiba in pakistan administered kashmir
pressure is being increased on pakistan for taking rapid action against extremist organizations after mumbai attacks
india blames lashkr e taiba for mumbai attacks
she says that no doubt the extremists responsible for mumbai attacks used pakistani soil
during this peshawar government says that unknown armed persons has set another truck stand for supply of goods to allied forces deployed in afghanistan on fire due to which more then fifty vehicles are destroyed
it is the second attack on neto and american supplies during 48 hours in peshawar
during this pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned lashkr e taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from karachi to tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action
the question is does pakistan want to do it
is pakistan capable of doing this
what do you think

(kindly note that due to the increase in reviews urdu typed reviews will be published
press altshift to select urdu on screen
i have only one question from all humanitarian leaders
you murder their children and they bring garlands for you thats impossible
knowledge of east and west is there any logic reason or philosophy which allows killing of innocent people including namazi laborers and poor service men in the revenge of american attacks
if your answer is no then you need to correct your point of view
people were armed because there was a danger of russia coming towards pakistan after afghanistan
now when the danger is that america can attack pakistan form the channel of afghanistan which was mentioned directly in the presidential campaign by the president himself then why should unarmed these people
just because america and india will not have to face any public resistance after defeating pakistan army
yes if any of them are involved in terrorist activities then only pakistan should take action against them
but it is sad that the fact that lashkaretaiba is involved proves indias claim that pakistan is guilty in this
najeebur rahman syco lahore
even if we accept that lashkaretaiba is guilty it is still not correct to blame the pakistani government
and another question is that were these terrorists not supported by an indian governmental or nongovernmental agent
are terrorists only born or prepared in pakistan and not in any other country of the world
as for as lashkr e taiba is concerned ongoing terrorism is not linked to it
it must be recalled that hafiz saeed was the first militant leader who declared activities of taliban revolt
i am quite sure that taliban agitation is a vital part of american plans so every person or organization must be eliminated who challenges taliban in any aspect
to terminate the expedition started by the american and saudi funding they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society
also protest them that by what ethics american and saudis are spreaded dangerous arms and so called jihadi but in fact the virus of loathsome literature and culture due to which human butcher houses established in our country
after facing the risk of attack from india the pakistani armys announcement that it would remove forces from the afghan border and post them at the indian border and the announcement of the taliban that it would handle the afghan border caused america to stumble and pressurize india not to attack pakistan
this showed the strength of america in the region
though india did not warn that they would attack and nor do they have that much courage
the taliban attacked and finished most of the remaining american supplies
that proves that without the pakistani army and tha pakistani government america is nothing
karachi business financial center of pakistan is dubai of underdeveloped areas
hundreds of thousand never return empty pocket from here but since the grip of law has weekend in western frontier areas all eyes are on karachi
now they are about to kidnap this city
first time pathans are named pakhtoon residents of a city are involved in fighting like strangers although need of the time is unity
one solution to the problem is that the urdu speaking learn pushto or the pushto speaking learn urdu or its better that everybody learns english
you must be thinking its a funny suggestion but dont you think the cause of the conflict is also funny
that the cause of the torture would be language
zaheer chughtai
sir in my childhood i had actually given the same suggestion many times to my friends which included people from every religion and rhetoric groups but my friend people used to laugh over these suggestions
at that time these rhetoric and religious differences were not that live and powerful but they were boiling inside
its hard to understand that what is happening and why
are these the signs of the judgement day
what are these innocent and innoxious people being killed for
the reason is in front of everyone ones who want to break pakistan into pieces are active and those who do all this neither belong to any religion nor a country
either karachi or mumbai it is an inside job
every upcoming government gets herself involved in changing the names of places like now a days airport roads buildings all benazir
is this the meaning of benazir which is happening in karachi and to the peoples of pakistan
at the height of the mumbai attacks the fact that the efforts to cause mischief on linguistic and racial lines in karachi failed is proof that those politicians working on racial parole have resigned from their jobs
the taking of the lives of innocent pushtu speaking labourers and the indian warnings have awakened the sleeping pakistani feelings from karachi to khyber
the identical country loving reaction of all the political religious linguistic and national parties has not only taught india the manners of diplomacy but it has also given the american policy makers a chance to think again
mqm and anp are responsible for the worse situation in karachi and administration is not neutral
administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately
police and rangers dont take action because of political parties pressure
to unite is only expressed in speeches political parties should have to quit their interests and work for common people
until there is pressure on the administration these kind of incidents will keep taking place
i think these people are the biggest terrorists
and foreign powers are definitely involved in this but no one knows who they are
but alas that if these incidents were in any city of nwfp then what would the government have done over there but since its not in nwfp the government seems to be helpless
the government should operate here and save a large and very important city of the country from terrorism
otherwise pakistan will face a huge financial crisis
bbc urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure and pakistani medias condition is already weak
the whole truth is there on bbc english
one solution to the problem is that either urdu speakers should learn pushto or pushto speaking learn urdu or better if every body learns english
you will definitely take is as a funny suggestion but dont you think the cause of the conflict is also funny
that the cause of extremism be language
they spilled blood in karachi and the story that each citizen was fearing for a long time was finally written
no one left any stone unturned and the reports that surfaced in the media was 50 of what actually happened here in four days
i stayed up the last three nights and i am still afraid
the people who killed the cobblers and peanut sellers who evacuated the hotel
the people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of allahs punishment which can catch them anytime
what do you think are the reasons for this sudden violence
(bbc)
keeping the heart rendering mumbai attacks in view and diving to search for a cause for the violence in karachi is not at all needed rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in blood
it is obvious that if someone mistreats the father it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control
the blood of the loyalists of liaqat ali khan also belonged to the same place but to eliminate mr psychos misunderstanding i am writing this verse
we will also repeat our elders traditions
we made it by sacrificing lives and will save it by doing the same
faizan tauseef siddiqui
it is very disappointing that whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other
mr siddiqui i request if wikipedia
see liaqat ali khan you will will find out that he belonged to a noble punjabi family from karnal in punjab
due to his steps for the migrants today the migrants consider him as one of them
there is always a reaction to every action
one can afford on oneself but
ijaz awan
sir before you get a large number of people with proposals i shall tell you that the open signs of this mischief is also found on the walls of karachi in the form of posters and wall chalking
we have been bearing both types of mischief
mischief mongers did not leave pakistan or the founder of pakistan they did not have to face any reaction
contrary to that they are pecking at the chest of pakistan
only muslim league (n) was left she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to peoples party
before this mqm and muslim league (q) has already submitted the draft of 18th amendment in assembly and senate
till now it appears that 18th amendment was a political move and none of the party is sincere in its approval
this is why nobody has raised voice in the favor of this amendment in senate or assembly and neither forced the house to approve the amendment
it seems that by submitted the draft of 18th amendment these parties has beaten around the bushes means they can claim that we had submitted the amendment but the ruling partys speaker did not proceed
mqm coalition partner of government muslim league n an underhand ally of government and muslim league q the party to approve the seventeenth amendment then how is it possible that these parties can be sincere to approve the disapprove amendment
its just like writing your name amongst shaheeds by just putting color on yourself
peoples party anyway is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment
how would one think of getting his own hands cut
as long as zardari is the president seventeenth amendment is not going to be cancelled
this is an opinion of a majority in our survey and so is the truth
if the seventeenth amendment was to be cancelled then zardari would never had become the president
now he is even more powerful that president musharaf as along with being the president he is also the chairman of the peoples party
as long as he is the president the seventeenth amendment will remain intact
in order to cancel the seventeenth amendment the political parties will first have to dismiss president zardari from the presidency
neither mqm wants this nor other parties
most of the elders from our family belonged to the labor community
in our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor work we used to pray to allah that please save us from this hard labor work
to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily amroz and asked him what should we do after matriculation so that we dont have to do labor work
the editor wrote in reply that we should select certain subjects and become doctors or engineers
right from beginning my trend was towards engineering and i had selected technical drawing instead of biology in metric as well
but at the time of admission in fsc my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing fsc in medical
i studied biology for hardly a month and then when nothing worked out i took maths as an alternate subject
means that the fear from labor work made me an engineer and now i am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which i am always thankful to god
i remembered that when i along with my two sons were trying to remove the carpets from our old house
we said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor
son started saying that i am studying and will complete my studies but i cant do this work
three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home
what it means is that when a man decides the destination no matter what were the motives behind this no one can stop him from getting it
but if you dont even know what you have to do then god be with you
it is said that dont accuse the dead but cant help it as we see only evils in her on the first anniversary of benazir
on one side benazir crushed independence movement of sikhs by handing over the list of sikh freedom fighters to india for her own sake and on the other hand provided india an opportunity to fully concentrate in kashmir after crushing the movement in punjab
the greed of benazir and nawaz sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years
during her exile benazir continued to give negative statements on kashmir and atomic program
benazir violated the london agreement with nawaz sharif and made a deal with general musharaf
during her rule benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make as much money that is why he is known as mr ten percent
during benazirs rule his brother got killed but his murderers are still safe from any punishment
besides being a woman herself benazir avoided fighting for womens rights
just like benazir did her politics over her fathers dead body similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body
benazir came into power twice but she could not punish her the culprits of her fathers political murder even she couldnt register a case against them
it has been 37 years since east pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day
what should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated 16th december as a didactic day and take such measures that this kind of incident dont take place again
on this day we could send greeting to the people of bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again
the rulers would reopen the hamudur rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of east pakistan
he would plan on bringing back the people of bihar who were stuck in bangladesh and he would send them gifts to keep their spirits up
we have become so insensitive that if someone dies in our neighborhood we are not even aware of it
we do not care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish
a huge calamity can pass by but the next day we are lost in our daytoday routine of life
if only east and west pakistan could become one again like east and west germany became one
we can become one again if we sacrifice a little for each other and leave our selfishness behind us
but this wish does not look like it will be fulfilled in the near future
today when it was told in the news that governor of american state illinois has been arrested for charges of corruption
and to remove him from governorship provincial congress is preparing for his rapid accountability our american friend who has a keen interest in pakistani affairs exaggeratedly said to me see this is democracy
no one is beyond the law in america
and there is your country pakistan whose president has been elected after dropping of corruption charges
my sense of humor woke and i said that whats wrong if a governor got arrested in america in pakistan once we arrested the prime minister overnight and hanged him and the second time we exiled one
tell me when it happened in america
pakistan sent off the lawbreaker with guard of honor from the presidency tell me when did such thing happened it america
in pakistan the chief justice was suspended in such a way that besides the public support he has not be restored so far did it ever happened in america
holder of a fake degree was made the minster for health in pakistan did it ever happen in america
after hearing all this the american went down laughing and then conceded defeat
in this picture president zardari is smiling despite of being surrounded by the americans from all four sides
it looks from his smile
he is thinking that america is supporting his government but he is forgetting that a year ago they were with pervez musharaf
this picture was passed on as if it was of some family
previously such a photo was never printed in newspapers before ie one president with three american agents
it seems as if americas work in pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one
it is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of president zardari breaking his promises
if it was a smart ruler at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting
if the rules of democracy are implemented on this photo president zardari is in minority
according to democracy the majority are the rulers of the country and the photo is speaking for itself who that is
paradiselike swat is also called the switzerland of pakistan
according to the government tactic so far along with force discussions have been going on
but the use of force is not giving any benefit other than increasing the force of the taliban and increasing the public favor for them
what needs to be done is that the government instead of using the power should eliminate the causes of the issue
by eliminating the causes fazlullah and taliban will automatically finish
the sharia bill proposed by anp will become the solution of the problems of swat to a great extent
but besides implementation of the sharia the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues
from the early steps of general musharaf it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians but the lust of power changed all his plans
those steps which were expected all brokeoff
as soon as bushs era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment he made a deal with the thieves
even then general musharaf could control the army but never know whats happening to the present government
in swat the strongly affected part of sarhad state despite the continuity of military action for over one year the situation is still going from bad to worse
on one side the government is only reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly on the other side the talibans illegal radio fm channel is having much more influence in the region
on the third side the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region
during the action of the security forces there were claims of destroying the fundamentalists by the bombing of gun ship helicopters and cannon houses but despite these destructions the taliban only became more powerful and according to an estimation their control over swat increased that much percent more
as a result on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat and on the other hand the taliban is stronger
who is stuck in between the poor civilians
it is said in swat that someone asked what kind of people are the taliban were so he got the answer they are very good as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of allah and the religion
then he asked how the army was so he got the answer they are very good as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country
he then asked who the enemies of the religion and the country were so he got the answer we civilians
i am wondering how the pakistani army will fight the indian army when they couldnt control a small faction of the taliban
could not track down talibans illegally operated fm channel which in my opinion is very easy
but still fm was spreading hatred in full swing
after girls schools now boys schools are being destroyed
curfew is imposed so that tablibans can move around easily
tonight 8 trucks entered the suburbs of mingora during curfew and created bunkers
the question is that how could they reach there during curfew
army could kill akbar bugti in his house and salutes taliban
for god sake someone tells this army to protect helpless people of sawat from taliban and prove that pakistan army can overcome any enemy
he says that most of the blood is spilt in the name of religion tell me that if religion was not then blood wouldnt have spilt
punjabi pathan white and blank mehsood and other tribes are these the products of religion
not at all sir religion preaches us that there is no white black punjabi or muhajir if there is no religion then half of the world would have been destroyed by the war of black and white and remaining half by the war of cast
actually religion nourishes human morally and restricts him that he is not here at his own rather is sent by the creator of universe and he has to live by gods rules
as a muslim i believe that islam is true religion and a complete code of life
after settling down in london every morning i would first call my relatives and ask them how they were most of them had never called me to find out how i was doing and i then realized that they do not like me calling them either so i stopped calling them
living here in france for two years i also felt the same way
i do not know why people only expect us to call
a resolution about iraq passed in a few hours to send a peace force to darfur is not at all a problem
immediately criticizing the mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours
and where there is a matter of death we are still holding meetings about that
o upholders of world peace life is finishing over here
is it really being waited to diminish
so that any again no aggrieved could even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights
when a father is running carrying his beloved sons dead body even then your hearts dont pinch you with pain
if not then you dont even deserve to be called human being
but you are a black mottle over the name of humanity
so atleast this has been proven that this region has also been a homeland for jews for centuries
ideally these two nations should have lived in harmony but since their strings are in western and arab hands so without their will peace can not prevail in this region
and now even iran wants to fight its proxy war from here
even if the israeli operation stops temporarily it will start again any moment after any incident
bbcs own country has its interests related to america and israel and this is why while taking cover of enlightened moderation it has started a series of blogs or jewism and doing a biased propaganda
bbc is only carrying the formality and its objective is to have sympathies
it is requested to mr moderator that he must publish this review so that it may be proved bbc has element of realism to some extent
thanks
i dont know who wrote this story or how this story came to being but one thing is for sure in every age draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people
in every age wars have been fought and blood has been spilled
but the surprising thing is that this 21st century man who considers himself civilized is quiet over this ruthless open massacre
how could i not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind
well wisher sajjad alhasnain hyderabad deccan
at this time including derah gahzi khan summer showers are taking place throughout the country
here is a poem according to the weather enjoy the weather along with this poem
these rains are with your presence
if it rains its spring
if it stays then its peace
sometimes comes without a reason
at times spread over day and night
sometimes very noisy and sometimes very quiet
these rains are with your presence
in a memory at a night
to a buried ash
sometimes it was such that the wind put it out
sometimes it burnt itself
sometimes each drop seems sorrowful
even these rains are from you
all these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase what is it to them whether the country lasts or not
whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them
for one our media is also corrupted like our leaders
its goal is only to extract money from the government and nothing else
as for the public they are ignorant to speak about them is the biggest ignorance
yesterday noon strange thing happened
the whole police was running here and there but was least bothered about illegal parking

yesterday it might be the historic cold in new york
the temperature does not fall to this extent
my jaw start to ache because of half an hour outside walk

a matter of relief as all the people were safe
the dark side is that the companys plane crashed in this financial crises

we unnecessarily kept thinking of these taliban of swat as indelicate but who were only unhappy over womens education
they kept expressing their grief by demolishing a womens school and college somewhere every day
but just like other ideas this idea did not also come true according to this report by cnn today on the sacred day of monday this taliban gang of swat have blasted a boys school
swat the taliban has destroyed a boys school
the girls schools were already destroyed acting according to the famous english saying ladies first i do not know why people are still bent on calling the taliban uncultured and barbaric
another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the taliban that they are against girls education is not true
rather masha allah they are against education altogether
may allah give these mujahideen more power and the evil government
which is let loose on us may he help them in uprooting them
just a while before this the wedding of a dog with a girl took place
look at that groom
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century
it is the era of computers and its involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life
many people have many reservation over this increasing involvement of computer for example in financial matters
where use of credit card bring ease to life it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life
so now only through your financial matters like through your credit card you can be located
and in future when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent its benefits will increase more and more
similarly in the world of crimes instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank the credit card information is stolen
similarly computers have become the source of friendship
social networking websites like orcet facebook and myspace are ranked first in popularity
but dont you feel that the more closer we are getting of these sites mentally practically moving further away from people
similarly there is the website of match making where by knowing your choice you are provided with a list of people according to your likings
can you spend life with your own cologne (of course not physical)
i cant do it that is why a life partner is known as better half
that heshe may cover my deficiencies
perhaps i have got a small share of sense
i used to believe everything someone elder says
in the same way i thought that my father knew the answer to every question on earth
i used to get laughed at a lot for this
but only that seems true which can be possible
it is very troubling that what is the need to tell lies
even at this age he was harmed by this
that is why i try to lie as less as possible
that i do not falsely please others that too with the name of allah
and that i say insha allah (if god wills) only when i am asking allah to complete the work
as for the intentions only allah knows best
this is a despicable matter that arose due to distance from religion
according to both our religion and pakistani law young children should stay with their mothers
their expenses are to be borne by the father and the father can meet his children
then when they become mature they live with whom they wan to live
you are right that the actual problem are the relatives who misguide
feudalism has overshadowed our deeds
even here is thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in fathers property so it is resisted although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated
here these restriction regarding making of relations have created many evils in the society
concept of remarriage of a divorced or a widow is getting rare
due these unnecessary beliefs and tradition the family system is facing disarray
in our society if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarry then why it is not appreciated
there is a pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago now after getting all his children married when he married a widow his own children have gone against him
in my opinion this is religious right what do you say
what type of mentality is the while we are there no one can take our mothers place kind of mentality
i believe that this persons children should have thought what is wrong if he married a widow after he married off all his children
thereby this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house
as the children would definitely have gotten busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him
the reason for this is ignorance
this is a result of the force of society
when people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that children start to feel ashamed of their fathers second marriage
though they should face the environment and say that their fathers action is in perfect accordance with islam
this is a curse in our society in which we are sunk since last 40 to 50 years
even a wife is agreed on the unethical activities of her husband but does not allow her for second marriage
if she had the power she wont allow him of this even after her death
along with husband spoils her afterlife too and causes an increase in corruption in society
chanting islam islam does not mean anything in reality we like only our culture and traditions
for instance keeping girls from gaining education and fearing marrying the girl of ones choice
as for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt)
in indoppak we embraced islam centuries ago but cant get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then islam
second marriage of man as ridiculous divorce as stigma divorced woman as untouchable love marriage as disgrace and mans marriage with an elder woman as the result of her cunningness is all because of such thinking
moreover to copy the western nations we declare veil and worship backward
it was easy to embrace islam to get rid of such thinking is very difficult
allah bless us all the courage for it
amen
writing urdu was never that difficult
centuries passed in writing this little
consider it enough
allah hafiz
but here situation is else
to say that common people are there to die for us if we die then martyr
if someone from common people dies then murder
may peace and blessing of almighty be upon you
i was coming back to my shop after the isha prayer tonight a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called
i thought that probable this man has lost his way or wants to ask something i stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car
he asked me if i could speak and understand arabic i said no problem you tell me whats up
he started telling that he has come from riyadh and here in medina someone picked my pocket kindly help me i said please go away brother since such an incident has already taken place with me that i gave this man 12 riyals so that he could reach riyadh but he started doing the same after moving a little farther
i was furious i cursed him and threatened him of the police then he ran away
this is the situation of muslims now that even for begging we ride our cars along with our families and make at least 2 to 3 thousand a day
however there is a clear hadith (saaw) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one
may allah bless us and make us true muslims (amen)

the wife of famous singer adnan sami reached went to police station for blaming him of torturing her
police has advised her to consult the court
saba galadari wife of adnan sami has filed an application against him that adnan sami continuously tortures her
and behaves inhumanly
now she is fed up of this therefore case must be filed against him
in place of filing case police asked her to consult the court by saying that this case is not under the jurisdiction of police
in your opinion the blame of adnan samis wife on him is true
is it not an attempt of india to defame adnan sami
do inform us with your opinion in this regard
adam sanghar mehr
as far as allegations are concerned anyone can post it on someone else
nothing comes before prestige
however may be the relations between adnan sami and his present wife he left his respectful life and went to india to make money and now this fame has caught him badly
this is a consequence of his own deeds
top american officials say that president obama will take strict stance over afghan president hamid karzai
in the new american policy over afghanistan there is more emphasis on war than development
officials say that hamid karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achievement of american goals since in his government there is corruption drugs business has increased and taliban are regaining their power
american officials say that people who are putting more pressure on hamid karzai to do more include vice president joe biden and president obamas representative for afhanistan and pakistan richard holbrooke
he said that this policy appeared after president bush who used to video conference with hamid karzai every two weeks left he used to stress upon the american role in rebuilding afghanistan and its civilian institutions
officials say that the obama government would work with the state leaders rather than the central government
the officials say that it will pressurize karzai to step up the war against corruption
hamid karzai is facing fresh elections this year and it is not yet clear whether obama and his group will support karzai for presidency or not
this statement of the american officials is not a precursor for a change in the american policy towards afghanistan is it
is hamid karzais rule coming to an end
what is your opinion about this
malik babar hussain judah it is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish traditions continue these feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule who would call them muslims
a sardar should walk himself over these embers why the present government do not act against them
when the judicial justice will come in handy
the srilankan cricket team has arrived karachi to play one day internationals
besides the indopak sullenness a visit by a foreign team to pakistan is very pleasing
upon reaching the karachi airport the srilankan team was very warmly welcomed
two one days between pakistan and srilanka in karachi whereas the third one day will be played in lahore
both teams have there claims over bowling batting and fielding
if the srilankans are proud of their spinners the pakistanis trust their fast bowlers
srilankan captain mahela jayvardena has said that not a single player from pakistan team but the whole team is dangerous
murli dharan and mendis will be the trump cards whereas the pakistan captain says that it will be a tough competition
shoaib malik has said that we have played murli dharan and well see mendis as well we have prepared a secret game plan and we shall implement that in the ground
will the paksrilanka series be really as interesting and exciting as the claims are
who will be dominate the series between pakistan and srilanka
who will win the series

how is all this is double for these people when the kashmiri people have been fighting for independence for the last 60 years
no no one asked and they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism so they start talking about making up
first they openly killed the muslims now they are in the efforts of setting things right
anyway pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies
asad khan london
india is creating such a situation that the worlds attention can be diverted from kashmir
but pakistan has always shown the real face of india to the world
now the british government is also understanding that the indians are taking cover from their occupation over kashmir by blaming pakistan of terrorism
and they hesitate to talk to pakistan over this issue
british foreign minister david milliband has said that by resolving the issue of kashmir will bring an end to extremism the government of pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders
it should be clear that the newly elected american president obama has also expressed similar views over the kashmir dispute
the british foreign minister while talking to media in mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president bush
david milliband has said that pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the kashmir dispute from the major powers isnt india trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region
isnt the terrorism in mumbai a part of this strategy
is india using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialog

i think super powers dont want to destroy pakistan
rather they are thinking of certain policies to control her they are familiar that pakistan is an atomic power
want to bring some sort of revolution
foreign countries believe that by cornering pakistan few hurdles may generate want to support pakistan and also wish to achieve their goal

it has always been a hindu tradition that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is ram

the prime minister syed raza yusuf geelani said that the newly elected american vice president joe biden played an important role in removing the expresident musharrafs uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy which is why the pakistani government has honored him with a special star

all decisions will be made in the parliament

american president george w bush in his outgoing press conference advised newly elected president barack obama saying that he had made many mistakes in his presidency and that barack obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate
i did as a president whatever i felt was appropriate according to the situation and the american law and constitution giving preference to american interest over my own acceptance
he said that the enemies of america are still planning to attack america and that the biggest challenge for barack obama would be to stop those attacks
he said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in iraq was the biggest disappointment for him and considering the iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake
speaking at his last press conference at the white house the american president said that this is my last press conference and i thank the journalists and other friends who are present in the press conference
do you think obama will not repeat the mistakes that bush made
did bush delay accepting his mistake
will obama be able to follow bushs advice

this is a sad calamity that israeli is massacring the palestinians and the same situation is prevalent in kashmir but there is no effect on the security council
all the organisations present in palestine and kashmir should keep their war going until they gain independence and they should form unity among themselves and keep facing any type of harm and one day or the other their martyrdom will give fruit god willing
israeli air attacks are still continued on gaza hundreds of palestinian men women and children have been martyred
the important leader of hamas nazaar rayyan and family has been martyred
the security council session ended without any decision
america has opposed the censure resolution against israel submitted by lebia and other arab countries in the session
israeli airplanes bombardment is continued since many days on palestinian civil population
the whole world reacted on mumbai attacks but no country including america and england can see bloodshed caused by israeli attacks
why the major countries of muslim world are silent
what will you wish to say on this double standard of the world

after ruling america for 8 years president bush has departed from the white house and shifted to the president camp office in camp david so that the white house can be renovated according to the new president barak obamas likings
during bushs eight years rule the historical attacks and destruction of the world trade center attack on pentagon and then in the name of war against terror attacking afghanistan and iraq and involving forces from other countries into the war and use of american resources in it have become memorable examples of his time
due to this war america itself faced the worst ever economical and financial crisis in history

the indian government has stopped the indian cricket team from visiting pakistan
the indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests five one day matches and one 2020 during the tour of pakistan
rajiv shekhla the vice president of the indian cricket board in an interview with jeev news said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the pakistan tour but due to the difficult situation in the two countries the tour was not possible
is the indian governments decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step should sports not be separated from politics
is the indian governments decision not harmful for cricket
despite the fact that the security condition in india is bad the england cricket team is continuing its tour so why cant the indian team make the tour of pakistan
what is your opinion on this
salman karachi
those people who are proud about going to india
and they make their films and videos over there their eyes should open now as to how much the people of india respect you
i remember an interview of adnan sami in which he said that he is not pakistani rather his citizenship is of england
adnan sami should come back to pakistan at the first opportunity because he did not get honor there either
farid ahmad
karachi
after the mumbai attacks the mode of the indians have changed
jagjeet singh reacted by expressing that he hates pakistan and pakistanis
it should be known that adnan sami has sung with asha bhonsle and how has he become helpless now adnan sami should stay in india there is no need for him to come here
muhammad shamshad aalam
karachi i will only say so much about jagjeet singh that he too changes colors like a chameleon
and speaks on the occasion pakistanis open your eyes and see how much you are respected in india do not be dull minded
after the mumbai incident their hate filled speech has increased now they are spreading poison about famous singer adnan sami
after that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards bush president bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself
second shoe hit the american flag
security personnels dragged the journalist away from there
at this point president bush said that he didnt know why he had done so shoe was of number 10 i had no problem
do you think this reaction of the journalist wasnt an expression of deprecation or president bush from the iraqi people
what would you say on this incident
the tension between pakistan and indias relations after the terrorism in mumbai got further intense when the fighter planes from the indian air force violated the pakistani airspace in lahore and kashmir sectors
as a result of retaliation from pak air force the indian planes were forced to go back
sources say that both indian planes were loaded with ammunition
in the current tensed situation it is the first incident of its own kind
pakistan air force says that air force is fully vigilant to defend the country
minister of information sherry rehman says india has admitted that it was a violation of air space limit however it was a mistake
pakistan army resources declared this incident as crucial
do you think india really intends to launch an air attack on pakistan
is indias claim is correct that this violation was a mistake or it was objected to measure the capability of pakistan air force
not this incident will increase tension between the two countries

it is true that she was martyred but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in karachi upon which she was proud that nasirullah babar did well
but later she changed totally
it is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party and made her son the representative of peoples party what kind of democracy is that
jami noor karachi this news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers
but until the iron ax is not fitted with a wooden handle it cannot cut a wing
our rulers are just like this that they are adopting secretive ways this is why calamities are befalling the country
may allah guide our rulers
