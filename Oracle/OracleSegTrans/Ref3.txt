this book has been written under the title the nuclear express a political history of the bomb and its proliferation and both the writers have claimed in it that every country that has made the atom bomb has either stolen nuclear secrets from another country or has had the cooperation of another atomic power

republicans said that the stimulus package was too costly and will not prove effective
244 voted were cast in favor of this package while 188 votes were cast against it in the house of representatives
this stimulus package will be presented in the senate next week where the ruling democratic party enjoys a very insignificant majority
concern is being expressed that due to intense opposition by the republican party it will not be easy to pass it in the senate
after the passage of the stimulus package in the house of representatives barack obama asked the members not to let political differences come in the way of this important plan
obama said that the plan which he hoped will turn into law by next month will help create a better atmosphere in the country where american trade will grow
under this plan ordinary people and the business community will be offered loan waivers of up to 275 billion and 540 billion will be given to repaire roads bridges and ten thousand schools and unemployment allowances as well as new technology research
bbc correspondent in washington richard lister said that barack obama had vowed to introduce a new political culture putting political differences behind but the discussion on this economic package has once again created bitterness in the political bases
members of the republican party in the house of representatives termed the bill proposed by the government as a waste of public money and said that this will not help create new employment opportunities
on behalf of their party they stressed on their own bill which focuses more on tax exemptions
they said that through their package more employment opportunities can be created with much less investment
they said tax exemption can create more and immediate employment opportunities as compared to construction plans
bitter exchange between israeli president and turkish prime minister

mr erdogan said i think you are using such words and that too in a loud voice to hide your guilt but you have killed people and i am thinking of the children who were killed near the coast
simon perez said that israel is not responsible for the gaza tragedy rather hamas is to be blamed which has established a dangerous dictatorship there
according to bbc correspondent in davos such a scene has never been witnessed at the world economic forum

role of european union for peace in middle east
if seen officially the european union has a decisive role to play in the efforts to establish peace in the middle east
according to the official position of brussels efforts of schwarzenberg delegation or sarkozy are equivalent to lending a supportive hand in this regard
spokesman for the european commission amadeu altafaj said any such effort is commendable that will help to convey the joint message of the european union to the warring factions
as far as the official statement is concerned everything seems fine
but in reality the european union presents a sad picture of internal conflicts
role of the czech republic as president of the union is already weak
on top of it the internal conflicts have rendered it helpless
on the other hand the french president is behaving as if he is still discharging his duties as the president of the european union
although france has already completed its six month term
sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he does have the ability to do that but he does not have permission to do so
french foreign minister bernard kouchner finds himself in the most absurd situation
he is part of the delegation that is being led by the foreign minister of czech republic schwarzenberg
on top of that both foreign ministers are giving divergent statement regarding the middle east war
kouchner believes that israel has the right to defend itself whereas according to schwarzenberg this war does not fall under the category of self defense on the other hand germany has also dispatched its special envoy to the middle east until the european union shows cohesiveness in its stand it can never be successful at the diplomatic front
the proof for this is israeli attitude that does not give any credence to the peace initiatives of europe
this is a golden opportunity for the european union to do something because america has failed in the middle east due george w bushs policies
economic crisis german billionaire industrialist commits suicide
adolf merckle of south germany has left behind a huge business group
but a little while ago ordinary german citizen did not know much about him
and when he had to negotiate for several weeks with nearly 30 banks that gave loans to his business group he came into limelight and he could also see the future of merckle group as bleak
merckle group faced loss of several hundred million euros after buying shares of the german car manufacturer volks wagen due to the economic crisis
after that when financial institutions declined to lend to this group the required loan of 700 million to 1 billion euros merckle came under immense pressure
some time ago the same banks had agreed to give loan on emergency basis to the merckle group but adolf merckle who started as a small industrialist and rose to this position and the annual income of whose industrial group was around 30 billion euros could not bear the loss of his investment powers
when adolf merckle took over the family business after the death of his father he organized it on modern principles and soon made enormous progress
he named his company ratiopharm which today is a highly successful and a very large drug manufacturing company in germany
until some time ago the business worth of this pharmaceutical company was between 5 and 6 billion euros and it still makes an annual income of 81billion euros after the tremendous success of ratiopharm merckle group acquired many large companies ranging from the building and construction material company heidelberg cement to the special vehicles manufacturing company kaessbohrer
the worldwide workforce of merckle group is almost 100000 persons and ratiopharm pharmaceutical company has always enjoyed special significance
during his life adolf merckle said on several occasions we have been making medicine for the last four generations
now the control of this company is in the hands of my children and i hope that for the next few hundred years it will remain under the administration of my family
after adolf merckles suicide the banks have approved 400 million euros of bridge vem loan for his group but on the condition that ratiopharm has to be sold so that the vem financial condition of this group can be improved over a long term
also after the death of adolf merckle the merckle group will not be the same as it used to be
crime rate among foreigners in germany
according to the interior minister of bavaria province joachim herrmann this is just a superficial positive change
he said it should be kept in mind that the number of foreigners obtaining german citizenship is increasing
therefore statistics should mention that although the one committing crime is a german citizen his background is foreign
herrmann said that his province will keep this in consideration while gathering statistics from 2010 onward
apart from bavaria hamburg is also thinking on these lines
senator of interior affairs christoph ahlhaus from cdu said when research is carried out on scientific lines one cannot make conclusions of ones choice but they depend on the statistics gathered as a result of research
ahlhaus drew attention to an analytical report of the provincial office on the prevention of crimes which had been prepared in july 2006 and which ascertained the rate of crimes among foreigners in bergdorf area of hamburg
results suggested that the crime rate among the foreigners here
was lower than that of crimes committed in all other areas of the province
on the contrary when the youth crime rate in berlin during 2006 was analyzed it became obvious that the rate of crimes in youths with foreign background
was 44 per cent
however germanys other political parties such as spd the party of environmentalists and leftwing party linkspartei are against the proposalthat data should be collected about foreign background of german citizens in the crime related statistics

afghanistan voter registration in perils
afghanistan election commission has said that due to security concerns it is delaying voter registration in some areas in south of the country
for the upcoming presidential elections in southern afghanistan voter registration began this week
but the commission has said that unless the security situation improves voters cannot register themselves in some areas of helmand province
these southern areas have witnessed an increase in violence since last year where taliban insurgents have increased attacks on afghan army and the international forces
meanwhile afghan army and international forces have said that between wednesday and thursday nights they have killed at least 28 militants in clashes carried across afghanistan
nato said that its forces have killed at least 22 militants in air and ground strikes in the northern khost province near pakistan border

it is not clear whether the afghan officials have referred to the same incident

nwfp province government rejects demand for ban on girls education in swat
nwfp authorities have rejected the threat for ban on girls education by taliban militant saying that this declaration is both against the law and islam
on sunday the nwfp education minister sardar husain babar said that government will never allow such attempts to succeed

despite continued military action in swat for the past one and a half year the militants have destroyed around 150 educational institutions either by explosive materials or by setting them on fire
as a result of the destruction of these educational institutions thousands of boys and girls have been deprived of education facilities

tea effective cure for breast cancer
according to a new research drinking three cups of tea a day
reduce the risk of breast cancer by onethird in women below 50 years of age
the research conducted at the moffitt cancer research centre in americas state of florida has revealed that the risk in developing breast cancer tumor in those women below 50 years of age
the research has also revealed that among women of higher age the daily dose of three or more cups of tea does not have any significant impact in this regard
experts believe that the reason for this is the presence of a substance in tea that is more effective against a particular type tumor that generally target women below 50 years of age
in moffitt cancer centre situated in tampa city of florida america this research was conducted on 5000 women who had undergone treatment for breast cancer
experts compared their medical records and lifestyle with such women who were free from breast cancer
experts have also found that the tea had a significant effect on a particular type of cancer lobular and it was reduced up to 66 percent
almost every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type
this type of cancer is the most dangerous because it is located vary deep and is detected only after it has spread extensively
according to the experts regular intake of at least three cups of tea daily significantly reduces the risk of breast cancer among younger women
they say that the body develops proper immunity against cancer if tea is included in our daily drinks and is made part of our daily routine
in britain every year around 40000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer
afghan war is the biggest military challenge for america gates
american defense secretary robert gates has said that the war afghanistan is the biggest military challenge facing america
gates was briefing the senate and house of representatives on obama administrations strategy regarding the afghanistan and iraq war
gates told the armed services committee of the senate that war is not the only solution of the afghan crisis but he also said that not enough troops were in place to protect a number of places and taliban take action taking advantage of this
why reduce exercise with age
new research
exercise is good for health at any age
it rejuvenates your heart reduces cholesterol levels helps lower weight helps prevent diabetes and slows down the onset of alzheimer
unfortunately in many people the ability to exercise decreases with advancing age
experts say that exercise keeps our mind and body alert however age can affect it
american medical experts say that lack exercise can lead to several health problems
dr patricia polacco of the mayo clinic minnesota says that age is a major factor in a persons reduce ability to exercise and reduction in physical acitivity
dr patricia teaches medicine at the mayo clinic
she headed a study on the ability to exercise and heart diseases in old age
doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the hearts activity
in which the hearts action of pumping blood its contraction and the hearts resting phase was observed
experts focused their attention on the left side of the heart which is the central point for pumping blood
they found that with the advancing age there is an increased disturbance in the hearts process of relaxation
dr patricia says that with increase in age the hearts relaxation process slows down and it also affects ones ability to exercise
dr gavan ken was part of this study
he says that he was surprised to note that this thing necessarily affects it and it also clarifies as to what extent poor exercise regimen is related to the hearts relaxation process
at times blood pressure can also be responsible for disturbances in hearts processes and heart diseases
if doctors and patients work together they can benefit from exercise despite advancing age
a detailed report in this regard has been published in the journal of american medical association
no chances of immediate war with pakistan indian army chief
chief of indian army general deepak kapoor has rejected any possibility of an immediate war with pakistan however he said that army was prepared to render sacrifices to defend the country and ensure the safety of its interest
general kapoor alleged that even after assurances and international pressure on pakistan in the wake of mumbai attacks the terrorist infrastructure in pakistan is not only intact but is active as well
he said this while speaking to media correspondents in srinagar
the chief of indian army was on a one day visit to kashmir valley to take stock of the overall security situation in the new delhi administered kashmir as well as to observe the preparation of armed forces along the border
he was asked to comment on media reports that pakistan has rejected the evidence presented to it by india about the mumbai attacks
general kapoor said that the political leadership decides the matters of war or peace
referring to the alleged presence of terrorist infrastructure on pakistani soil general kapoor said that indian army would fight such elements which are out to disturb the peace and weaken india
he said between 700 and 800 militants are present in the indian kashmir of which almost fifty peer cent are foreign militants
general kapoor said that with improvement in weather infiltration from pakistan and pakistanadministered kashmir may increase however india has stepped up vigil along the border
he rejected the call to reduce the military presence in the indianadministered kashmir saying that national security cannot be compromised
may prayers of the world come true and barack proves a blessing to the world
although there is not much hope but let us see how far the relations between pakistan and america turn our way as a result of this change
let us see how mr barack who himself is the realization of martin luther kings dreams puts them into reality
oathtaking as president of america today by obama whose name also includes hussein is not only an historical event in all respects but also is a stern test in history
for himself but also for all of them who supported him wholeheartedly
this is also a test for the white majority who may find it difficult to wholeheartedly accept a black person as their ruler
people in south asia especially the muslims who have pinned their hopes on him should remember that he has been elected as the president of america and obama should bear in mind that an american president is practically a president of the world
a little while from now a man whose racial brethren were brought from their respective homelands to america with the yoke of slavery around their necks and who had nurtured the foundations of the most powerful nation of the modern era with their blood and sweat will become the fortyfourth president of this very america representing the same racially marginalized community
a lot many people have a lot of expectations from this man
it is necessary for those who love him not to pin unrealistic hopes on him
if obama can somehow reduce the hatred emanating from sources such as race and religion it will be a victory for those who love him
what impact will this change have on south asia and can some meaningful change be expected in the american policy due to this development
how will this change affect the relations between pakistan and america
dear sir whether it be obama or someone else the multibillionaire effective strong and influential jewish lobby determines the policy and nature of relations with the whole world
and as far as pakistan is concerned the aggressive behavior of indianisraeliamerican triangle in connection with the recent mumbai blasts is before the whole world to see
for a long time even after the creation of pakistan the wali of swat was responsible for the administration of swat with his regular army and law
he handed over the administration of swat to the government of pakistan by a treaty
but its a pity that our governments accorded a stepmotherly treatment to swat
neither there has been an increase in number of schools at all in swat since abolition of rule by the wali of swat
nor any interest has been taken in the construction and development of swat
the number of girls who have been getting education in the present era are many times lesser than these were in the previous era
in the frontier province of pakistan the series of targeting the educational institutes by the local taliban is continuing
the largest number of the schools most of whom were for girls have been destroyed in district swat
not being content with that taliban have also announced a ban on the education of girls in swat
thousands of boys and girls are being deprived of education
what do you think taliban want to achieve by stopping the education of the girls
why has the government so far failed in checking these illegal acts
what do you reckon the government should do
the question should be what will the isi and the pakistani agencies get
because the people of swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the taliban and not to kill them otherwise how five schools could be blown up in one night despite the curfew and how people could be slaughtered and hung in the central square of the city during the curfew hours
how can the government succeed in checking these illegal activities when it is not being allowed to establish its writ in swat
so the question is that the government has everything including armed forces modern weapons modern technology and the intelligence system etc then how come it cannot control handful of taliban
the answer can only be that they have the blessing of some secret saint so neither they run out of ammunition nor they get caught
and the conclusion is that the taliban are making the job of international imperialism easy through their dark acts
fifteen years ago there had been a war in afghanistan
the isi was controlling the taliban and the opponents were the northern alliance who were being supported by russia india and iran
then the situation changed and the sins of taliban began to surface
and the isi too was offered dollars by the americans so the former friends became enemies
now the situation is that the war is still raging but in pakistan the helpers are the same iran india and russia
as long as a man does not develop a sense of right and wrong he continues to err
for instance when a thief sets out to commit a theft but realizes in time that theft is not good it is a curse he will be punished and he also fears god then he wont commit theft
similarly as long as israel does not realize that it has been committing something wrong by spilling the blood of the innocent people and rendering itself to punishment it will continue to play havoc with the lives of the innocent people in gaza
hello
the question is do war an armed movement and terrorism offer solution to the problems
if not then what is that magical formula which would lead to solution of the problems
it is correct that war and violent means do not settle problems rather they aggravate them
palestine afghanistan and iraq should follow the same model for success of their movements which was adopted by nelson mandela in south africa
that is instead of armed struggle they should opt for moral and political struggle and selfcontrol
it appears from their participation in elections that kashmiris have endorsed this point of view
israeli attacks on gaza have entered into the third week and the death toll has reached almost one thousand
the war has not ceased so far despite international diplomatic efforts
and according to one estimate ninety thousand palestinians have left their homes for safe areas since the start of attacks on december 27
accusing the israelis of being careless about the security of the palestinian children the aid agencies have alleged that a whole generation of the palestinian children will have to experience acute psychological and emotional traumas
what do you say
how can lasting peace be possible in gaza

taliban be given an opportunity
basit peshawar
wake up if the taliban start doing the real jihad who would then slaughter the innocent people
who would burn the girls schools
and who will do kidnapping for ransom and in case the ransom is not paid to them who would hang the people by the poles by declaring them american spies
these taliban have caused more harm to islam than any other nation or religion
pashtun rohr
kohat pakistan
if the united muslim world may just only give a threat to attack israel jointly you will see how much israels godfather america will be hurt
and not only there would be talks for immediate real ceasefire but a ceasefire will take place as well
but what can we do sir how can our muslim rulers muster up so much courage
someone should ask ahmadinejad to take initiative because a lot is being said about his bravery on bbc forum
responsibilities relating to maintenance of peace and human rights do not devolve upon arabs or the muslims of the world alone rather it is duty of the international community to raise their voice against cruelty
this horrific incident is the deadliest of the sins committed by bush so far
just like corruption and plundering is let loose in government departments in pakistan and india by 30th of june ie the end of a fiscal year the american administration before its dissolution has given israel the green signal to do whatever may please it
on the one hand america says that efforts will be made for ceasefire
on the other hand the united nations is passing one resolution after another but nothing has been done practically this leads one to reach the only conclusion that the united nations is also working to crush the muslims
all the muslim countries should immediately cancel their membership of the united nations and form an international organization of their own
we have many examples before us where america and the united nations have only made pledges and passed resolutions but the loss has been suffered by muslims alone
it is all bunkum as the bbc is not going to publish anything
where have they buried all the principles of journalism now whenever the innocent blood especially belonging to the muslims is spilled the bbc gets obsessed with nonpartisanship
otherwise it is a selfproclaimed guardian of truth
let alone revealing something at their own they have plunged so deep in meanness that they do not even publish commentaries
the only difference between you and the jews is that they claim their jewish identity and kill muslims and people like you live among muslims call themselves muslims and kill muslims
syja786
it has been a long time that a particular sect is being targeted on bbc forums sometimes on account of suicide blasts and other times on the pretext of terrorism in india
the favorite catch phrase of these antiislam comments is extremism
but who is the extremist you can easily surmise from the comments above in which someone has virtually been declared a nonmuslim for writing against iran
when will our muslim brethren understand that the evildoers cannot be combated with sword
one cannot help shedding tears of blood over the deaths of unarmed civilians in israeli bombing
but the basic fault lies with the sedition and bloodshed that is our misnomer for jihad and by doing so we try to tarnish the beautiful face of islam
when the majority of the palestinians has recognized israel why does hamas have to fire rockets into israel or conduct suicide attacks
the behavior by both sides is inhuman
the role of america and the united nations again appeared to us as being supportive to israeli atrocities
may allah let the muslims be united amen
and consider bestowing the nobel prize for the war on terror to the real terrorists on this painful act of terrorism because they are the ones doing the actual work
otherwise is it possible to do acts of terrorism at such a large scale without the backing of some powerful lord and everyone knows who holds the strings
this can then be said to be hoodlumism ie do whatever you can
the powerful man beats and then does not let the victim weep
the arab rulers are providing medicines for the injured and shrouds for the dead and money as well but it is still being asked
israeli attacks what should happen
the problem actually is that the rulers of all the muslim countries including the saudi king are in a slumber neither they have any army nor any defense plan and they assume that by offering aid they have done their duty
they should at once take practical steps against israel
like an embargo on petrol for the european countries and america but alas
salaam to all brothers and sisters
i think in this hour of adversity suggesting hamas to stop its struggle in the name of peace will be sheer injustice to thousands of widows and millions of orphans and will be equivalent to their failure
if israel and its allies are at the height of their pharaoh like vanity a moses too will be born in their home shortly because such is the law of nature the steps taken by america and israel are working as a catalyst for producing suicide bombers in the muslims
and these elephants who are intoxicated by power are unable to understand it
abu abdullah pakistan
hamas and israel should strike peace now so that the bloodshed may stop
muhammad sarfraz paris france
absolutely correct
lets us suppose that hamas is hundred percent right in its cause and wants to win divine approval by launching jihad against the barbarity even then it must know that if such virtuous acts start destroying happily living families it no longer remains a virtue
the love of humanity is a part of their faith for those who claim to love god his prophet and their religion
so it is gods commandment to wipe out all those on whom divine books were revealed from the face of the earth except muslims
najeeburrehman psycho lahore pkitn
no the commandment is not to wipe them off but to preach islam to them
but jihad is ordered against those who hatch plots against the religion
they should be fought against until they stop hatching the plots but it does not mean that one should wear a jacket and detonate it in a crowd
my brothers the ultimate end of the murderer of the innocent children is destruction
but i beg to say to my friends that these jews who did not have a shelter in the near past have become so strong that they do not listen to anyone in the world now because they are united
they are neither shia nor sunni all are jews and they have taken every step to progress in all walks of life
on the contrary look at the conditions of the 55 islamic states
they are lacking in every field and now the situation is that they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for death
it is needed that all the muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against israel
feroz magsi jhang pakistan
and there is no better strategy than to recognize israel and by doing so learn the modern sciences and the ways to progress and let the world live in peace
muslims have enough land and resources
all that is required is the proper usage
the saddest part is that hamas and alfatah could not unite
great leaders like yasser arafat and sheikh yassin were killed with such precise planning so that the only brave nation of this territory carrying out jihad for the sake of alaqsa mosque may be weakened and as long as yassin and arafat were not removed from the way it was impossible
the world is seeing that how palestine disintegrated after the demise of the these two leaders
and with every passing moment the jewish lobby kept on strengthening its hold
in 1974 a pakistani prime minister was a man with such international credentials that he brought together all the muslim rulers of the world with hundred percent attendance under one roof
is it very difficult for this nation to promise on his 81st birthday to not only create unity among its own ranks
but also carry forward his incomplete mission (to set up an islamic commonwealth) by mediating to settle the differences amongst other muslims as well
this is a genie who has been haunting palestine for half a century
this genie has many mouths
often it uses one of its mouths to condemn itself and to divert the pressure and attention of the world
and the other mouths of this genie are eating humans in iraq afghanistan iran and pakistan
and this genie is most fearful of islam because it knows that whenever it would be exorcised it would be done by muslims and their completely practical religion islam because history tells that islam has taught lessons to all the powerful abu jahls of the time
the series of bombing on gaza by israeli war planes and the missile attacks has been continuing since december 27
more than 300 palestinians have been killed in these attacks so far
after the aerial attacks the israeli tanks and armored vehicles have also reached the gaza border with full preparations for a ground assault
the security council of the united nations has asked israel and the palestinian authority to stop the violence immediately
however the israeli authorities say that they would continue action inside gaza until they are certain that the rocket attacks on israel will stop
do you agree with israels point of view that this action is an attempt to defend israeli integrity
is the international community playing its part in this situation
is this aggression directly related to the coming elections in israel
can any improvement in the middle east situation be expected after newly elected american president barack obama takes office
(please note that due to excess number of comments only those will be published that are typed in urdu script
for this press altshift on the onscreen keyboard to select urdu)
palestine is the most sacred place for muslims for all the times to come and its security is our compulsory duty
and we must remember that it is our first noble sanctuary
and israel india and america have to disappear one day because these countries were made to disintegrate and gods wrath will soon visit these heathens sajid sadiq lahore
the night of separation cannot pass by weeping only
no affliction leaves with prayers only (nawabzada nasrullah khan)
bbc searches for and publishes such comments
after all they have to maintain the impression of nonpartisanship
by the way the news by the bbc are generally correct but the actual problem lies with the presentation of the news
what has to be highlighted and what has to be marginalized
etc
zaheer chughtai
our pakistani electronic and print media in particular some urdu newspapers and columnists are second to none in exaggerating due to muawiya like spite while covering or writing about the increasing extremism and terrorism over here
where is the united nations that apparently talks of human rights and peace but when muslims are subjected to the intense cruelty and suppression the only words that we hear from their mouths relate to their demand to hamas to stop the attacks for how long will this dual policy go
why are the muslims being subjected to so much cruelty if countries like america stop backing these jews god has plainly told that this nation will live the meanest form of life and this nation can never live normally so o people of america stop backing them and then you will see what fate holds for them
the socalled arbitrators of justice and those who murder and plunder in the name of peace should mind this fact that the peace in this world can be established only through justice and not through injustice and genocide
if a nation could be wiped out by genocide only and the desired results could be achieved the very existence and glory of the jews today would not have been possible after hitlers actions
as a poet has said
barbarity ends when it stretches beyond limits
and blood congeals when it trickles down
who would tell now what is terrorism
does all this not fall under the category of terrorism why does everyone feels only ones own pain
are the others not human beings or the blood of the muslims is worth so little was the blood of all the innocents not red
why is no one sending messages of condolence now
i watched the mumbai attacks as if my own house was on fire because i cant see the grief of human beings and who cannot see this grief would that the muslims could think about that on the same lines
dead bodies lying on the road the helpless injured and bloodstained innocent faces how do we condemn when we are lost for words
i am brought to tears by the helplessness of the muslims because when on the one hand the people get killed in india the whole world pushes pakistan without any proof to take action or they shall take action themselves
and on the other hand israel is conducting blatant genocide of the muslims and the world is silent this is unbearable
gods mill grinds slow but sure and when this darkness of disappointment will end then
any threat to israels existence in the presence of america is a joke
as far as the elections are concerned the rulers may undoubtedly engage in this kind of activities to win public support particularly in case of a state like israel and as far as barack obamas factor is concerned history stands testimonial to the fact that neither any american ruler has ever gone against the policy nor he will imperialism whether black or white is after all imperialism
it is clear from the ongoing discussion on the forum that everyone is sad over the death of benazir but her shortcomings as a politician have not been overlooked
it is debatable if benazir sacrificed her life for democracy or for government
if democracy was dear to her why did she leave the public at the mercy of musharafs dictatorship for ten years till she got american clearance and struck the deal
benazir did not come to pakistan when people under the dictatorship needed her unfortunately she came to pakistan when she had been promised acquittal from all cases and access to power
there is no one to defend the historical figure who is being criticized unnecessarily
sana khan
some things are overlooked because nothing can be done about them
another reader
mrmadam perhaps you had better study history written in four friendly countries and seven other countries and not merely rely on history in pakistan then you will probably agree with mr psycho
tariq ayaz
those who dont have innate disposition dont learn from training
the reflection of the tree wont become green no matter how long the tree stands at the edge of the stream
britain never allowed them to be one and invented hindumuslim dispute which was nurtured by sir syed
psycho
how merciless is our nation they write panegyrics for themselves and also for the glory of their party blindly but now every historical figure and intellectual is being blamed and criticized and there in no one to raise voice against it
we have made enough progress
sana khan
some things are overlooked because they cannot be helped like an ass wont become a scholar simply by carrying a book load
although there has been a break in the ongoing dialogue process between pakistan and india in the wake of the mumbai attack pakindia should nevertheless continue this dialogue
if we talk of war there will be loss of human lives on both sides
india has said that the man captured in the mumbai attack is a pakistani citizen who has sent a letter to pakistan in urdu but on the other hand when india arrested this extremist they said that he was some senior engineer but now they say that he is educated only up to level 4 this is noticeable
first of all christmas greetings to mr bhana and all other christian friends on the forum
the mates on forum my regards to mr psycho a raza sister sana sister shahida akram and the rest
we want the flowers of peace and not the flames of war
war is a problem in itself
how can war provide solution to the problems
it will bestow fire and blood today
it will yield hunger and poverty tomorrow
therefore o conscious people
as long as the war is avoided it is good
in your and our courtyard
it would be better if the light of peace keeps on burning
indiaamerica relations have strengthened very deep now and india certainly knows that america will openly betray pakistan in the hour of need
the old history of america also proves this
whereas in case of an indian attack not only will the american interests be met but also india will bear all the expenses
pakistan should make a clear announcement that it would not strike first but if any aggression is carried out there will be no talk of reconciliation peace and ceasefire until either india is completely destroyed or occupied even if it may cause destruction to ourselves as well
this is the islamic history
even before this resolution the message that the pakistani people and the military had to convey has been conveyed
indias attempts to gain military and diplomatic benefits in compensation for the mumbai attacks has been portraying it more as a cunning party than the affected one that is why the world community has lessened its pressure on pakistan after harsh initial reaction
without taking note of indias unnecessary hullabaloo the expression of satisfaction over pakistans efforts by the united nations and the appreciation by the interpols head of pakistani efforts is the sideeffect of indias over enthusiastic diplomacy
there are no divided opinions on the fact that this is a very cruel act
but the question is that when thousands of taliban attacked the village of pir samiullah where was the pakistan army and what was it doing
should the army not be held accountable for what it has done there in one year
how many taliban are killed by thousands of mortar and heavy artillery shells they fire every day
and stop this fake operation
the day is not far now when a resolution about military intervention in pakistan will be passed in the united nations in the same manner as it was passed against jamaatuddawah
our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing all the proofs and justifications for action against them and may i have soil in my mouth for saying such a cursed thing the day such a resolution is tabled there is every likelihood that no one will support us in the united nations
and suppose there is some delay in the passage of such a resolution some powerful country following the precedent set by america will launch an attack by itself
we have no knowledge of the personality and the achievements of pir samiuallah and of his activities
perhaps he was not a revolutionary
just as the dead bodies of comrade che guevara nawab akbar khan bugti dr najeeb ullah and thousands of other revolutionaries have been defiled by the enemies
they are immortal even after their death
but an international game is being played here the people are being ruled by terrifying them through barbarity and brutality
so that a justification may be created that if we are not here these beasts and brutes will take over the government
this act of the socalled islamists in the name of islam is extremely condemnable act
the supporters of these extremists can see the american atrocities but rather than expressing grief over such cruel acts they evade the responsibility in the name of tribal customs
no kindhearted person has any justification for such a cruel act disguised in the tribal customs or perpetrated in the name of islam
in my opinion the personnel of our army are collaborating with them
this is proven by the fact that when these people move the movement would at least take so much time that that they could be arrested but let alone reaching the spot these people even if they are in vicinity flee the place
are these guys so powerful that they can take fifty to seventy men hostage and our army keeps watching the spectacle idly
they are humans as is the army
it is evident that there is something fishy
since the era of true dictatorship of ziaulhaq the mullahism has been creating such an atmosphere of fear and terror in the name of religion by its descriptions of the various kinds of exemplary punishments and torture rather than highlighting the mercy and love of god besides the incident of hanging of the corpse their literature and books like what will happen after the death strike terror in the hearts
and these people are using this fear and terror as a weapon merely to get the wealth and status of this world
o preachers
you have so terrorized the world by the fires of hell
it surprises me when it is said that this cannot be a muslims deed
we are either ignorant of our history or overlook it for the sake of convenience
were the attack on madina by yazeeds army and the tragedy of karbala perpetrated by hindus and jews
without accepting the facts we can neither quash the motives nor can we provide redress
o bbc people stop this dual policy
a better super hit title on this subject was shoeflinging at bush justified or not
should have been
tahir chaudhary japan
friend feel some shame a mans body was exhumed and suspended to the pole only because he had raised his voice against cruelty and you are worried about titles for box office
the success of the operation sherdil and of operation lionheart on the other side of the border depends on how favorable is the public opinion regarding them
this act has been perpetrated by the pakistani and american agencies and pir sahib has fallen prey to this conspiracy
from now on all the comments on this forum will be antitaliban because the agents of the secret services have successfully penetrated taliban and are conducting such actions as can change the common mans opinion
i would just like to ask what was the army doing when this dead body kept hanging from the pole for the whole day are they sitting there just to target the common people their statements are like shelling on the hideouts of the taliban 2 children and their mother killed by a shell hitting the home
did they not know about this square
or were they watching the spectacle
we humbly request and plead that for gods sake stop this game
after all there is one ruler above you too
whether or not the question asked by bbc was appropriate the credulity of the writers hurts for instance no one asked why had this thirty thousand strong army gone to swat
that the corpses of those who support the army and fight taliban remain hanging from poles all day long
even if we overlook what the illomened pakistan army did to the swati people the media including bbc has done no good by hiding the facts from the world
pakistan army is playacting
every child of swat is saying that this is a gory play
for gods sake stop this drama
these taliban have tarnished the reputation of the muslims
if all the true muslims of the world dont call them as muslims how can then these terrorist find safe havens in their lands
those who lack all sense of honor and cant work hard take up the gun and join these groups
shame shame
neither any religion nor any family traditions provides its justification
all the media including bbc comment through various sources on taliban and the tribes
but no one knows what the actual position is we know it because we are the tribal people
in short this is a game that involves cia raw mossad and our own isi there is neither any talib nor any tribesman these mutineers are the creation of these agencies and are now casting a slur upon islam taliban madrassahs pakhtun nation tribes and the tribal customs
the heads of all the muslims are bowed in shame over this act
i salute the mqm leader altaf hussein and the leadership of anp and ppp who talk about this cancer namely taliban
this cancer is the product of ziaulhaq he himself departed but also destroyed pakistan
but i am hopeful that the present leadership will be able to expunge this cancer
after the mumbai attacks india said that some pakistani extremists had a hand in these attacks
pakistan refuted these claims and said that it will extend all possible help to india in the investigation process
india said that it had given pakistan a list containing the names of 20 suspected extremists who were wanted by india
now pakistan has said that maulana masood azhar the leader of jaish muhammad who is included in this list is not under house arrest and the pakistan government has no information about him
earlier the pakistani president asif ali zardari dismissed the impression that the western secret agencies and the indian government had provided evidence regarding the mumbai attacks to pakistan
president zardari said about ajmal qasab that it had not so far been proved that he was a pakistani
meanwhile prime minister manmohan singh has warned pakistan that its relations with india wont improve as long as its land is used for the terrorism purposes
and in the most recent update the indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to pakistan
should these political events affect the sports too
what future for pakindia relations do you foresee
neither america nor india will disintegrate pakistan
pakistan will be disintegrated by the pakistanis
what do you expect after so much provincialism sectarianism and mullahism
the time has proved that jinnah did not do any good to the muslims of india either
yasmin chicago
dear lady if work had continued on jinnahs vision neither would the cancer of provincialism sectarianism and mullahism have spread in pakistan nor would the muslims of india have been meted out such treatment
it is our mistake that we have not been able to produce a leader of his stature
if we cannot honor our heroes then
there are lots of skills in this area
only god knows when will the wisdom prevail here and this land will progress due to the bounty of unity
in both the countries mullahs pundits taliban shiv sena rss etc have been assembled to destroy peace
and the satanic forces do not want that this land may progress in peace so these countries are being exploited
can you imagine what would be the status of this area consisting of pakistan india and china if there is unity
pakistan is suffering gods wrath that is why thieves robbers and cattlelifters have been imposed as leaders on the nation
may our country pakistan never come to any harm amen
but my lord open your eyes and look at the conditions and the ground realities around you and you will be able to see where the american forces have reached
moreover the internal situation does not look right the situation in frontier baluchistan and karachi in sindh is in front of you
in these conditions the country needs a leader who can make us a united nation
o god have mercy on us
i think there is no solution other than one last war
enough is enough
there should be a breakthrough now
the problem will not be settled by the hypocritical masquerades of talks
neither would it settle by minor terrorist activities in other countries
after all europe did not have peace until it fought the last world war
if this world war had not taken place these countries would have been squabbling like pakistan and india till now
almost all of our political parties agree that terrorism and sectarianism should be expunged from the country
but our military leadership does not seem sincere in this effort on the one hand america and europe are ensured that we are with them in this war on terrorism and on the other hand we secretly help the taliban as well
we have to think now and determine our orientation and choose only one path thanks
there is no doubt that the majority of the members of jamaatuddawah consist of those members of lashkaretaiba who joined this new party after lashkaretaiba was declared a banned outfit
however its activists have since then preferred to do aid work and now the united nations has declared it a banned group on strong insistence by india and the government of pakistan is also continuing its crackdown against them
i think these jihadist groups had better quit extremism and carry on with religious and aid work
the terrorist organizations based in pakistan who have employed professional criminals in the name of religion and senior mullahs are the very people who call pakistan as the land of the defiled and god knows what
now they are leaving no stone unturned in destroying pakistan
in fact leave aside muslims they cant even be called human beings
without cleansing pakistan of these mischiefmongers national security will remain in danger
is it still debatable whether these malignant elements should be banned or not
there is no room for the violent mullahs in this world as their only job is to get the others killed
this news has crushed the heart
what kind of world is this where those who just pronounce the name of one of the fundamental principles of gods religion islam find life difficult
nonmuslims can kill the muslims but if a muslim tries to exact revenge all the nonmuslims of the world along with all our hypocritical rulers join forces to treat the true and the sincere servants of the religion in the same fashion as they are doing today with our great leader hafiz muhammad saeed
in the aftermath of the mumbai attacks india
pakistan relations have experienced bitterness and the improvement in the relations between the two countries over recent years has suffered severe setback
india has persistently been holding active militant and nonmilitant groups in pakistan responsible
and the normalization of the relations has been tied up with action taken against these groups
whereas the indian security agencies have held lashkaretaiba directly responsible for the mumbai attacks
the name of jamaatuddawah has also surfaced time and again in this connection
this is not the first time that the relations between the two countries have suffered on account of some act of terrorism in india
in december 2001 these two neighboring countries reached on the brink of war after an attack on the indian parliament
after this in 2002 lashkaretaiba was banned and included in the list of the terrorist groups
now it is being demanded that jamaatuddawah which the security analysts say is actually the new face of lashkaretaiba should be banned
should this group in your opinion be banned or not
should pakistan act decisively against the active extremist groups in its territory
by imposition of ban on jamaatuddawah
can the present pakindia crisis be averted and how important is it to ban the armed groups for lasting peace between the two countries
the united nations security council has banned jamaatuddawah after all what proof the security council had for being so hasty
does the security council not always show such agility against muslims
this is called a lazy claimant and overactive witness
in a way india has itself become a failed state
whose intelligence army and other security institutions have failed who were kicked around by a few terrorists for 72 hours and by blaming pakistan for this failure india is cheating the whole world
if one heathen is killed there is hullabaloo in the whole world why is there this double standard
the only nonpolitical religious welfare organization of the country
furqan farooq faisalabad
as long as our prophet (saw) the mystics and the sufis accorded love and respect to all human beings islam flourished and developed in peace and tranquility
muslims too made progress in all walks of life
but when this beautiful religion was taken over by mullahism distinction between believer and nonbeliever started and new chapters of violence and malignancy began which the world did not know before
salam do it sir of course do it but do it on your own
dont do it under american pressure
if india has some problem should she not present some proof
why does india not offer the proof
and why does she blame us for everything
there are extremist groups and organizations in india too why dont they ban them
are we the only terrorist people in the world
what name would you give to indias actions in kashmir
what name would you give to israels actions
the truth is that we are the first islamic nuclear state in the world why do we enjoy this status is the bone of contention
pakistan is in the last stages now
kamranhassan abu dhabi
your point of view appeals and the conditions too seem like this
now the american magazines are openly publishing the new map of pakistan and these sanctions also seem to be another step in that direction
americans are now strengthening their hold on pakistan not slowly but very quickly
in these circumstances if we did not display solidarity and unity as a nation then remember if bangladesh can secede a lot of other things can also happen
any amount of condemnation of the terrorist attacks whether they be in a hotel in mumbai or in marriott hotel in islamabad or in palestine is insufficient
similarly irrespective of their origins from pakistan india america or israel they should be exterminated
now the question is that why the whole world including the pakistani authorities have been keeping silence on the terrorist attacks that take place in pakistan every day and in which hundreds of people get killed
was the attack on marriott hotel not conducted by the terrorists
then why
hats off to advisor on interior affairs mr rehman malik by gods grace his highness has become so brave and bold
not only this according to bbc his highness mr malik has also dismissed this impression vehemently that the arrests of the terrorists are being carried out on someones orders
o brothers all praises be to god
having the ability or not or saying that dont want to
whose war we the pakistanis are fighting
and we have our interests too that well try our best to safeguard
no one has the right to interfere in some other countrys national affairs
apparently the colonial period is over
if the people expect to find justice or the allies press for independent judiciary respect the democratic institutions and do not support a dictator or military ruler peace will be established in the third world including pakistan which is probably not acceptable to the allies
pakistan in any case remains subservient to american and european ambitions
this is done in spite of opposition by a large majority of the people of pakistan
and this further ignites opposing sentiments
if america and its allies have faith in democracy they should shun the colonial practices and leave the area by showing respect to the sovereignty of the state
pakistan has enough ability to arm or disarm
the security forces have raided an alleged camp of the banned lashkaretaiba in pakistani administered kashmir
after the mumbai attacks pressure is increasing on pakistan to speed up the action against extremist organizations
india alleges that lashkaretaiba is involved in mumbai attacks
she said that there was no doubt that the extremists who carried out the mumbai attacks had used pakistani territory
meanwhile authorities in peshawar have said that another trucking station used for supplying goods to the allied forces in afghanistan has been set on fire by unknown armed men fifty trucks have been destroyed in this incident
this is the second attack on nato and the american forces supply in peshawar during the last 48 hours
meanwhile pakistan has conducted a raid on an alleged camp of lashkaretaiba prior to this many efforts have been made to unarm the armed groups from karachi to the tribal areas in which those who return the arms have been promised bounty and amnesty in return
the question is does pakistan want to do so
does pakistan have the ability to do so

i have only one question to all the torchbearers of humanity
it is impossible that you kill their children and they welcome you with garlands
and my question to you is that do any system of knowledge ranging from islamic to eastern and western any logic argument or philosophy sanction the murders of innocent prayergoers laborers and poor working class servants in response to the american attacks
and if the answer is in negative you are in dire need of amending your point of view
people were armed at the time there was the threat that after conquering afghanistan russia would target pakistan therefore these people were armed
now when there is the danger that america would attack pakistan via afghanistan the current american president has expressed this openly during his presidential campaign so why should we disarm these people
only to ensure that after conquering the pakistan army america or india would not have to face any public resistance
true if anyone of them is found involved in a terrorist activity only pakistan should take action against him
but the sad aspect of it is that governments action against lashkaretaiba has verified indian claims that pakistan is involved in it
najeeburrehman psycho lahore pkitn
even if it is accepted that lashkaretaiba is involved blaming pakistan government is not right
and this question too did these terrorists not have the support of some official or unofficial indian agent
are the terrorists produced and trained only in pakistan and are not trained in india and the other countries of the world
as far as lashkaretaiba is concerned it has no link with the recent terrorism
it is worth remembering that hafiz saeed was the first jihadist leader who declared the taliban activities as seditious
i firmly believe that the taliban insurgence is a vital part of american strategy so every person or group who opposes taliban in any way will have to be removed from the scene
to end this movement that started with american and saudi funding now request them to mop up this corruption that has contaminated our society
also let us register protest with america and saudi arabia that on what moral grounds had they spread the virus of dangerous arms and socalled jihadist which are actually hate literature and culture prompting killings in our country
after the threat of indian attack and the declaration by the pakistan army that they would move the troops from afghan border and post them against india and the declaration by the taliban that they would take care of the afghan border america stumbled and used full force to ensure that india did not attack pakistan
this has revealed the truth about american power in the area
although india has neither threatened to attack nor does she have courage
and the rest was done by the taliban attacks on american supplies
thus it is proven that without the support of pakistan army and the government of pakistan america is nothing
karachi pakistans financial hub is dubai of all the backward areas
millions never return emptyhanded from here but ever since the supremacy of law has been challenged in the western frontier areas all the people have diverted their attention to karachi
now they are bent upon to take this city hostage
for the first time the pathans are being called pakhtoons people of the same city are being made to fight as strangers although there is need to show solidarity
one solution to the problem is that all urdu speaking people learn to speak pushto or vice versa and if all the people learn to speak english it would be even better
you would definitely consider it a ridiculous piece of advice but does the cause of the clash not seem ridiculous to you
that language may be the cause of violence
zaheer chughtai
sir time and again i offered this piece of advice to my friends who belonged to all religious and linguistic groups during my childhood but every time people used to laugh at it
these linguistic and religious hatreds were at that time not as powerful and strong as they are today and were mellowing within the hearts
i cannot understand what this is and why this is happening
are these the signs of the doomsday
for what crime are the innocent people being killed
the reasons are before every one those who want to disintegrate this country are active and those who do it have neither any religion nor any country
whether it be karachi or mumbai the destruction has been caused by inmates
whichever government comes it only changes the names of places to become famous for instance now a days airports roads and buildings are all called benazir
does benazir mean that what has been happening to the people of karachi and pakistan
the failure of raws attempt to ignite linguistic violence in karachi at the height of the mumbai attacks proves that the political elements that used to be on raws payroll have now resigned from the service
the murders of pushto speaking laborers and the indian threats have awakend the dormant nationalism in pakistanis from karachi to khyber
the identical patriotic reaction by all political religious ethnic and national parties not only made india to learn rules of diplomacy but also provided food for thought to american planners
the responsibility for the worsening of the situation in karachi lies on muttahida and anp and the administration is taking sides
the administration can control situation in 1 hour but this is being aggravated on purpose
due to the pressure of political parties on police and rangers it refrains from taking action
the talks of solidarity are restricted to statements only the political parties should shun their interests and work for the benefit of the common man
as long as the political pressure remains on the administration such incidents will keep taking place may god keep pakistan under his watch
i think these guys are the biggest terrorists
and there must be some foreign powers involved in it though we do not know who they are
but the sad part is that if such a situation had been prevailing in some city of the frontier the government would have crushed it but now that this situation does not relate to the frontier the government seems powerless
the government should conduct an operation here and save a large and important city of the country from terrorism
otherwise pakistan will face a huge financial crisis
bbc urdu is not publishing truth out of fear and the condition of the pakistani media is even worse
the whole truth is present on bbc english
one solution to the problem is that either all the urdu speaking people learn to speak pushto or vice versa or an even better solution is that all the people learn english
you would certainly consider it a ridiculous piece of advice but do you not find the cause of the clash ridiculous
that the language may be the cause of violence
at last another epic in cruelty was written in karachi which every citizen of karachi had been fearing for a long time
everybody did whatever he could the reports published in media hardly tell fifty percent of what happened here in the four days
we spent three sleepless nights and are still fearful
all those who got the hotels vacated killed the cobblers and peanut sellers
looted on the super highway and amputated the ears of the innocent peoples are ignorant of gods wrath which will come upon them eventually
what in your opinion are the causes of this sudden unrest
(bbc)
keeping in mind the dreadful killing spree in mumbai we do not have to search too deep for the cause of karachis turmoil the straightforward and easy explanation is that this turmoil has unconsciously occurred because of strife in blood
evidently if someone incites dad it would not be surprising if his son gets out of control
the blood of liaqat ali khan and many other martyrs also came from that land i am writing this couplet to amend mr psychos misconception
we shall repeat the custom of our forefathers
we sacrificed to make our homeland we shall sacrifice to save it
faizan touseef siddiqui
it is regrettable that the country is at stake and we are busy in infighting
it is for your information mr siddiqui that if wikipedia
is searched for liaqat ali khan we shall learn that he came of a respected punjabi family from karnal in the punjab province
because of his services to the refugees the refugees today consider him one of their own
every action has a reaction
one can bear as long as it is confined to ones person but
ejaz awan
sir before you too gather a crowd of the advisors in no time let me tell you that the blatant symbols of true hoodlumism are found in the form of wall chalking and the posters on the walls of karachi
we have been suffering both kinds of hoodlumism
the ruffians did not even forgive pakistan and its founder they did not have to suffer any reaction
rather they are still defiling pakistan
only the muslin league (n) remained and now they too have handed a manuscript of the 18th amendment to the peoples party
before this mqm and the muslim league (q) had submitted manuscripts of the 18th amendment in the national assembly and the senate
it seems so far that the manuscripts for the 18th amendment are only a political gimmick and no one sincerely wants to have it passed
that is why no one has either vociferously talked about it on the assembly or the senate floor or pushed the house to endorse it
it seems as if these parties have hoodwinked people by submitting the manuscripts of the 18th amendment this means that they have got the justification now that they had submitted the amendment and it was the ruling partys speaker who did not initiate proceedings on it
mqm is the ally of the government while the muslim league (n) is the hidden ally and the muslim league (q) is the party that passed the 17th amendment how can these parties be sincere in repealing the 17th amendment
this is sheer cheating
in any case peoples party is in no hurry to repeal the 17th amendment
how can one think of cutting ones own hands
as long as zardari is the president the 17th amendment wont be repealed
this precisely was the opinion of the majority of the people in one of our recent surveys and this is also the truth
had they wanted to repeal the 17th amendment zardari would not have become the president
now he is even stronger than president pervez because he is the president and the chairman of the peoples party simultaneously
as long as he remains the president the 17th amendment will stand
before repealing the 17th amendment the political parties will have to banish president zardari from the presidential palace
neither mqm wants so nor do the other parties
most of the elders of my family belonged to labor class
and when in my childhood i used to watch my paternal and maternal uncles doing menial labor i used to pray to god to spare me from such physical hardship
to avoid this i wrote a letter to the editor of daily imroz and asked him what i should do after matriculation so that i did not have to do hard labor
the editor replied that i should become doctor or engineer and start studying the respective subjects
from the beginning i was inclined towards engineering and in the matriculation i had studied technical drawing instead of biology
but at the time of admission in fsc my elder brother forced me to do fsc in premedical and become a doctor
i studied biology hardly for one month and when i could not understand a word of it i exchanged it for mathematics
i mean the fear of menial labor made an engineer of me and now i am at a very good position among many of my peers and am always thankful to god for this blessing
i was reminded of this when i was trying to lift the carpets from my old home with the help of my two young sons
i said if this were true then he should study diligently like me and get rid of the menial labor
the son said that he was studying and would complete his studies but he could not do that kind of work
somehow the three of us completed that work in three hours and returned home
the purpose of narrating this is if one specifies a goal for whatever reason may there be nothing could stop him from achieving his goal
and well if you do not know what you want to do then only god is your savior
it is said that we should not speak ill of the deceased but what can we do even on the first death anniversary of benazir we can only remember her shortcomings
on the one hand she crushed the independence movement of the sikhs by providing the list of sikh freedom fighters to india for the sake of her interests and on the other hand she provided india with the chance to focus on kashmir after crushing the movement in the punjab
benazir and nawaz sharifs scramble for power which plunged the country many years back is recorded in history
benazir continued the streak of negative statements on kashmir and the nuclear program during her exile
in violation of the london accord with nawaz sharif benazir struck a deal with general musharraf
during her reign she allowed her husband to openly amass wealth and for this reason he was called mr ten percent
during benazirs reign her brother was killed and his killers have not yet been punished
although she was a woman benazir avoided the fight for womans rights
just as benazir played her politics over her fathers corpse similarly her widower husband is now playing his politics over her corpse
benazir won the government twice but punishment aside she could not even get a case registered against the political murderers of her father
it has been 37 years since the east pakistan seceded and look at the extent of the insensitivity of our people and the rulers that none of them either mourn or repent over their mistakes
the proper course of action should have been to commemorate december 16 as a day of admonition and we should have made such moves that such an accident would not happen again
we should have sent goodwill messages to the people of bangladesh and tried to bring them closer to us again
the rulers should have opened the hamoodurrehman commissions report and considered the reasons that led to the secession of east pakistan
they should have thought about some way to bring back the biharis stranded in bangladesh and sent them gifts for encouragement
but we have become insensitive if someone dies next door we do not get the information now
we no more care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish
no matter how great a tragedy may befall us we get back to business the next day
as the east and west germany have unified would that east and west pakistan could unify once again
we can again unify if both sacrifice for each other and come out of the shell of selfishness
but i do not see this wish coming true in the near future
when it was reported in the news today that the governor of the american state illinois had been arrested on corruption charges
and as the state congress was preparing for his impeachment at the earliest to remove him from the governorship a white american friend of mine who keeps a keen eye on the situation in pakistan bragged to me that this was called democracy
even the strongest man is not above law in america
and then there is your country pakistan whose president has taken office only after getting the corruption charges against him dropped
our sense of humor was stirred and we replied that the arrest of one governor in america was not a big deal since in our country one prime minister was arrested and hanged overnight and the other one was exiled in no time
tell us if such a thing had ever happened in america
pakistan saw off the president from the presidential palace with guard of honor who had dismissed the constitution of the country tell us if it had ever happened in america
in pakistan the chief justice was dismissed in such a way that despite having public support he has not yet been reinstated has it happened in america
a fake degree holder was appointed health minister in pakistan did it ever happen in america
the poor american laughed himself out and conceded his defeat
in this photograph despite being surrounded on all sides by the americans president zardari is smiling
it appears from his smile
as if he thinks that america is with his government but he is forgetting that these same people were with pervez musharraf a year ago
this photograph has been posed for as if it were a family photo
never has such a photo been published in a newspaper before this that is one president with three american officials
it seems as if americas workload has increased in pakistan and she has to do it with more than one workers or it may be so that they dont trust the new slave as much as they did the previous one
it is also possible that this arrangement had been made keeping in view the notoriety of president zardaris reneging
had there been some wise ruler he would have not given a smile in this photograph and the shame over the yoke of slavery would have been visible on his face
if the principle of democracy is applied to this photograph president zardari would find himself in the minority
according to the democracy only majority rules the country and the photograph tells who is in majority
the heavenly swat is also called the switzerland of pakistan
according to the government strategy so far the talks are being conducted along with the use of force
but the use of force has been of no use except further enhancing the talibans power and creating sympathy for them among the public
it is needed that the government addresses the causes of the problem rather than using the force
if the causes are addressed fazlullah and the taliban will automatically vanish
the proposed shariat bill from the anp government will to a great extent provide the solution to the problems of swat
but along with the implementation of shariat the government will have to focus on the economic problems too
the initial steps taken by general musharraf suggested that this nation might get rid of the unworthy politicians but the lust for power transformed all his intentions
and expectations of taking certain steps ended
as the bush era neared its end he began to worry about the end of his regime and signed a deal with the thieves in panic
general musharraf could nevertheless have controlled the military but the present government does not even know what is happening
the conditions are steadily getting worse in the troubled areas of swat in the frontier province despite the military operation that has been going on for more than a year
on the one hand the governments writ in this area has been reduced to passage of a resolution of condemnation in the national assembly and on the other hand the influence of the illegal fm radio channel of the taliban has been steadily increasing in swat
the third aspect is that the ordinary citizen finds it convenient to obey the person who is ruling the area
the claims are made about the deaths of many extremists in swat by the gunship helicopters and in the artillery fire in the operation being conducted by the security forces but despite these deaths not only have the taliban consolidated even further but according to one estimate their control has spread to almost eighty percent of swat
consequently on the one hand the government is not prepared to concede its failure and on the other hand the taliban are more stable
and who has been crushed between the two the ordinary citizens
it is said in swat now that someone asked what kind of people taliban were and the reply came that they were very good since they were the guardians of the faith and were fighting the enemies of god and religion
then they were asked about the army and the reply was that the army was good because it guarded the country and fought against the enemies of the state
then it was asked who were the enemies of the religion and the country and the answer came we the ordinary citizens
i wonder how pakistan army will fight against the indian army when it cannot control a small group of the taliban
they cannot track down the illegal fm channel which i think is very easy to do
even then this fm is poisoning the airwaves with full force
after the girls schools the boys schools are now being destroyed
the curfew is imposed so that the taliban may easily move around
tonight during the curfew they came in 8 trucks and dug up trenches in the suburbs of mingora
the question is how they reached there in spite of the curfew
the army can kill akbar bugti in his home but salutes the taliban
for gods sake someone may explain to this army to liberate the powerless people of swat from the clutches of taliban and prove that the pakistan army can overpower any enemy
his highness says that most of the blood in the world has been shed in the name of religion tell me that if there had been no religion would no bloodshed had taken place
are punjabi pathan white and black mehsud and the other tribes products of religion
no absolutely not sir religion preaches that there is no distinction either between a white and a black or a punjabi and muhajir had there been no religion half the world would have been killed in the wars of color and the rest would have perished due to the enmities based on caste
in fact it is the religion that provides moral training to the man and binds him that he has not come here on his own rather he has been sent by the creator of the universe and he has to spend his life according to his commandments
as a muslim i am absolutely certain that islam is a complete code of life and a true religion
after taking up residence in london i used to call each of my relatives every morning to ask about their well being even though they did not return the favor even once then i realized that they even did not like our calling them and we stopped making the calls
during my two years stay here in france i have also felt the same
i wonder why do people expect us to make phone calls
the resolution about iraq passed in a few hours sending peace force to darfur no problem at all
prompt condemnation of the mumbai attacks and ban on the suspected organizations takes only a few hours
and where the dance of death is on we are procrastinating
o contractors of world peace life is dying here
are they waiting for its real extermination
so that then no sufferer can even think of using a weapon of mass destruction like a slingshot to win his rights
when a father is running carrying the dead body of his beloved child do you still not feel a pain in any part of your heart
if not then you do not have the right to be called a human being
rather you are a stigma on the face of humanity
well at least this much is proved that this land has also been the home of the israelites for thousands of years
the proper course would be that these two nations live together amiably but since their strings are in the hands of the west and the arabs there can be no peace here without their consent
now even iran wants to fight its proxy war from here
if somehow the israeli action might stop for the time being it would start again in the wake of some incident
the interests of the bbcs country are associated with american and israeli agendas and this is the reason that it has arrived with a series of blogs consisting of projewish material in the guise of enlightenment and is engaged in onesided and blind propaganda
bbc is merely fulfilling the formality and its sole purpose is to win sympathies
mr moderator is requested to kindly publish my comments so that one may have feelings that there still is some element of prorealistic attitude left in bbc
thanks
no one knows who wrote this story and how did it come into being but one thing stands tested that in every age the dracula have been feeding on the blood of the innocent people
there have been wars and bloodshed in every age
but the surprising thing is that how can this man of the twenty first century who considers himself to be thoroughly civilized remain quiet over this open and blatant massacre
how come he does not feel that whatever is taking place is presenting the worst facade of humanity

the winter rains are on these days in dera ghazi khan and in the rest of the country
here is a poem in keeping with the weather conditions enjoy this poem with the rain
these rains come with you
when they pour down they are the heralds of spring
when they stop they are the inner peace
sometimes they come for no apparent reason
sometimes they are here day and night
noisy they are and quiet sometimes
these rains come with you
in some memory on a night
and in these subdued embers
put out sometimes
and sometimes burnt myself
sometimes there is sadness in every drop
these rains come with you
these rulers are about to run away with a briefcase whether the country survives or not they dont care
whether the public sells tooth powder or polishes the bells in the temples with the rind of the lemon
our media too is corrupt like our rulers
its sole purpose is to wangle out money from the government
as far as the public is concerned it is ignorant and talking about public is a greater display of ignorance
something strange happened yesterday afternoon
the police was running around but neither questioned illegal parking nor
and furthermore nypd traffic was in no mood to check the illegally parked vehicles
it so happened that a us air plane really became a plane and landed in the hudson river
only this much is known till now that the terrorists belonged to the bird species goose
it was perhaps the historical chill of new york yesterday
temperature does not fall so much
my jaw has begun to ache due to half an hours walk in the open
just imagine the condition of the people who would have jumped from the plane into the river
the good thing is that all the people are safe
and the sad part of it is that the plane of the company sank in this financial crisis
while watching all this i went to new jersey by west side highway and although i had noticed that the westbound was closed what did i do
yes i got stuck in this very jam on the way back
thankfully during my one hour trip the route had partly been cleared and i found the exit of 56 street
otherwise i did not take the first two exits due to lines of traffic
makki my pakistan thank you and eid greetings to you as well
ammar of course believers
shagufta thank you eid greetings to you as well
sara i have sacrificed two hens the sacrifice does take place and jahanzeb has told you about its method
there is no other method
and we have to go to that farm cut all the meat including skinning

we unwittingly kept considering the swati talibani group uncivilized because they resented the education of the women
they had been expressing this displeasure everyday by blowing up schools and colleges for women at one place or the other
but like most other thoughts this thought also proved untrue according to this news item on cnn a talibans group has demolished a school for boys with the help of explosives on this sacred monday
swat taliban demolish a boys school
actually the girls schools were first destroyed following the famous english proverb ladies first it is beyond reason why people are still bent upon calling taliban as uncivilized and wild people ignorant of civilization
this clarifies another point that the allegation against the talibans group that they disapprove girls education alone is incorrect
they are by the grace of allaheven against education itself
god may grant these mujahedeen more power and the infidel government
that has been imposed on us the almighty may help them to uproot it
it also refreshed the memory of a girls marriage with a dog a little while ago
look at that bridegroom too
even in twenty first century they are lacking in humanity
this is the age of computer and the interference of computer in every walk of life is on the rise
many people have plenty of reservations on this growing interference of the computer for instance in financial matters
on the one hand credit card makes life easy for you and on the other hand it tightens the grip of the law enforcing agencies on your private life
because you can now be revealed through financial transactions like the records of your credit card
and in future when the use of actual currency will be considerably reduced its usefulness will expand
similarly in the crime world the credit card details are hacked rather than going through the hazards of robbing the bank
similarly computerized means are now available to develop friendships
social networking websites such as orkut facebook and myspace are top ranked websites in terms of popularity
but dont you think that the more we rely on these social networks the more we are distanced from the people practically
similarly there are match making websites where you are shown the list of people by matching the list of your choices with their choices
can you spend your life with someone who is exactly like you
i cannot the life partner is therefore also called the better half
so that heshe may compensate for my shortcomings
i wasnt probably blessed with my due share of wisdom
right from my childhood everything that any elder said was the truth for me
just as i believed that my father knew the answer to every question of the world
i used to be ridiculed for this behavior
but only the possible things seemed to be true
i felt uneasy about telling a lie
and i have suffered even at present age because of this habit
i therefore try to resort to lying as little as possible
i dont want to give someone a false hope especially in the name of god
and use god willing only when i pray to god for a particular job
in any case only god knows the intentions better
this is a dreadful problem and has been caused by the estrangement from religion
according to our religion and the constitution of pakistan the infants should stay with the mother
the father is responsible for their subsistence and can meet them
when the children mature they may choose with whom they want to live
you have correctly written that the real problem is the relatives who misguide
the feudal mindset determines all our actions
even here the same mindset is working that new shareholders in the inheritance of their father will be born and this very fact is resented otherwise this act of their father is worth praising and following
these restrictions regarding matchmaking have given rise to social evils in our society
the concept of the marriage of the widow or the divorced woman is becoming extinct
owing to these useless beliefs and unreasonable customs the family structure is suffering from disintegration
in our society if the spouse of a fifty or fiftyfive years old person dies and the widow or the widower may marry someone else why is it looked down upon with such disapproval
a pakistani uncle lives in our neighborhood his wife died 10 or 12 years back after performing the weddings of all this children he married a widow and his children turned against him
in my opinion this is his right by sharia what do you say
what kind of mindset is represented by as long as we are alive we cannot bear the thought of someone replacing our mother
i think the children of that man should think that he has committed no wrong by marrying a widow after the marriages of all his children
this way the widow found some support and the uncle too got someone to manage his household
because his children must have got busy in their lives and would not be giving him proper time
it is caused by ignorance
this is the result of social pressure
when people make fun of their family on such an act the children begin to feel ashamed at the second marriage of the father
though they should face the situation and tell that their fathers act was absolutely in accordance with islam
this is a curse in our society and we have fallen prey to it completely over the past 4050 years
even a wife accepts that her husband may fornicate but will not allow him to marry again
and if it were in her power she wont let him marry even after her death
she not only destroys her salvation and her husbands salvation but also becomes a cause of spreading corruption in society
singing the songs of islam is useless because we actually like the things that are according to our customs and traditions
for instance vanni kari keeping the girls illiterate and killings by gun shots on love marriage
as far as your question is concerned had the old man shifted to the widows house after marriage rather than bringing her home his heirs would have made token protests and then gone quiet and content (the heirs of the widow would then have had butterflies in their stomachs)
we embraced islam many centuries back in the indian subcontinent but could not get rid of this ignorant mindset and preferred customs and traditions to islam
to consider the second marriage of a man as livid divorce as a stigma a divorced woman as an untouchable love marriage as a shameful act and the marriage of a younger man with an older woman as a sign of her wickedness are the results of this particular mindset
furthermore in the footsteps of the western nations we declare abstention and purdah as old fashioned
it was easier to embrace islam than to get rid of that mindset
may god grant us power and courage for this

i was returning to the shop after ishaa prayers tonight when a man who was sitting in a car lifted his hand and got my attention
i thought that the man might have lost the way or wanted to ask something i stopped he had his family in his car
he told his objective and said that he was not sure if he could understand arabic well or not and i told him that it was not a problem and he should tell his story
he started to say that he had come from riyadh but here in madina someone had picked his pocket and requested me to help him i asked him to excuse me because i had already experienced such an incident where i gave a person 20 riyals and asked him to get the petrol tank filled and go to riyadh but he started the same thing a little further on the way
i was enraged and i scolded him and threatened him with police at this he ran away
the situation now is such that we muslims come in cars with families to beg and easily swindle two or three thousand in a day
although there is a renowned hadith (peace be upon him) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand lower hand means the hand of the taker and the upper hand means the hand of the giver
may god bless us from his bounty and make us true muslims (ameen)

famous singer adnan samis wife while accusing him of torture reached a mumbai police station
the police station has directed her to invoke the court
adnan samis wife saba galadhari has filed a petition against her husband stating that adnan sami consistently tortures her
and has subjected her to inhuman treatment
she cannot bear it anymore and a case therefore may be registered against adnan sami
rather than registering the case the police asked her to invoke the court since the matter cognizable by the police
are in your opinion the allegations leveled against adnan sami by his wife justified
is it not an indian attempt to defame adnan sami
please post your opinion on this issue
adam sanghar maher
as far as the allegations are concerned anyone can level them against the other
there is nothing greater than honor
whatever the nature of adnan sami and his present wifes relation may be he left his life of honor and went to india to earn money his notoriety has cost him dearly
this is the retribution of his own actions
senior american authorities say that president obama will take tough stance on afghan president hamid karzai
in the new american strategy on afghanistan the war has been given precedence over development
the authorities say that hamid karzai is being seen as a big hurdle in the way of achievement of american goals in afghanistan because the government is corrupt the narcotics trade has flourished and the taliban power is resurgent
american authorities say that the people among the american administration who are putting pressure on hamid karzai to do more include vice president joe biden and president obamas envoy on afghanistan and pakistan richard hallbrook
they told that this strategy has come to fore after the departure of president bush who used to hold video conference with hamid karzai every fortnight and stress the need for american role in the reconstruction of afghanistan and its civilian infrastructure
the authorities say that the obama administration would work with provincial leaders as substitutes for the central government
the authorities say that they would further push hamid karzai to fight corruption
hamid karzai is facing new elections this year and this is not yet clear if obama and his colleagues will support him for presidency or not
does this statement by the american authorities foreshadow a shift in american policy regarding afghanistan
is the hamid karzai era nearing its end
what is your opinion on this
malik babar hussein jeddah its highly regrettable that such dark customs are still prevalent in this modern age these feudal landowners and headmen target innocent people with their barbaric rule who would call them muslims
let some tribal chief himself walk on these embers some time why does the government not proceed against them
when will the courts provide justice

all this has been done by them kashmiris have been fighting the war of independence for the last 60 years
no one has asked them now as they are enmeshed in the war on extremism and terrorism talks about peace have been started
first they massacred the muslims and now they are trying to settle things
anyhow pakistan has to comprehend their dual policy
asad khan london
india is creating such a situation that the worlds attention may divert from kashmir
but pakistan has always revealed the true face of india to the world
now the british government too is comprehending this that is why the indians are trying to divert attention from their occupation of kashmir by defaming pakistan on the issue of terrorism
and are reluctant to talk to pakistan on this issue
british foreign minister david miliband has said that the solution of kashmir dispute will check extremism the government of pakistan will be able to deal effectively with the dangers on the border
it should also be noted that the newly elected american president obama has also expressed similar views on the kashmir dispute
the british foreign minister has said in an interview with media in mumbai and has written in an essay that the concept of war against terror is wrong killing people on the pretext of the dangers posed to oneself was president bushs policy
david miliband has said that pakistan should show no leniency towards the extremist groups
is india not trying to divert attention from this issue by creating tension in the region in the wake of the pressure put by the big powers on the need to resolve kashmir dispute
is mumbai terrorist attack not a part of this very strategy
does india want to avoid the process of comprehensive dialogue on the basis of terrorism

i think the big powers do not want to absolutely destroy pakistan
rather they are thinking of some steps to keep it under the thumb they know that pakistan is an atomic power
they want to create an environment for revolution over here
the foreign countries are thinking that there can be some geopolitical problems if pakistan is cornered they want to help pakistan and in doing so accomplish their own interests

the hindu have always traditionally been bad at hear but righteous in face

prime minister syed yousaf raza gilani has said that the newly elected american vice president joe biden played an important role in the removal of the uniform of the former president musharraf and the reinstatement of a crippled democracy so the government has bestowed upon him the sitaraeimtiaz
the credit of the removal of the uniform and the reinstatement of democracy should not go to some political party parliament is not a rubber stamp
all the decisions will be taken in the parliament
the prime minister said that the chapter of dr qadeer had been closed

in his farewell press conference president bush said to the newly elected president barack obama by the way of advice that he made many mistakes during his reign and barack obama should do what he considers right
i acted as the president according to the circumstances the american constitution and law i preferred american interests to my popularity
he said that americas enemies were planning attacks on america even on that day checking these attacks would be the biggest challenge facing barack obama
he said that the biggest disappointment for him was that the weapons of mass destruction were not found in iraq and his biggest blunder was the declaration of the mission accomplished in iraq
addressing his last press conference in the white house american president said that this was his last press conference and he thanked all the journalists and others present for gracing the occasion
do you think that obama will not repeat the mistakes that bush made
has bush not been late in conceding his mistakes
will obama be able to follow bushs advice

its a very painful tragedy that israelis are massacring palestinians and the same situation exists in kashmir but the security council takes no notice at all
all the organizations present in palestine and kashmir should continue their war till the independence and combat the aggression by standing united one day their martyrdom will bear fruits by the will of god
israeli air strikes on gaza are still continuing hundreds of palestinian men women and children have been martyred so far
hamas key political leader nazarian has been martyred along with his wife and children
on the other hand the security council meeting ended without reaching a decision
the resolution of condemnation against israel tabled by libya and other arab countries in the meeting is facing opposition from america
the israeli aerial bombing of the palestinian civilian population has been continuing for many days
the whole world began to shout at the mumbai incidents but no one including america and great britain have taken notice of this massacre by israeli attacks
why are the key countries of the muslim world silent

i think the actual reason is that most of our nation is uneducated they do not know where their money is going the government is interested in fulfilling its responsibilities by levying taxes the electricity and gas crisis will remain the same
because everyone is aware of the character of those who have been elected by masses
the electricity and gas crisis has assumed critical proportion in the width and breadth of pakistan
on the other hand the gas prices have been increased on average by 8 from the 1st of january whereas the nonavailability of petrol in some cities of the country has been a big worry for the people
intense reaction by the industrial and business communities of pakistan against the lengthy load shedding hours and gas crisis public disorder and violent protests have been continuing
the industrialists have served the ultimatum that they would close down the factories
on the other hand the citizens are upset over eight to ten hour load shedding in karachi
the industrial activity is almost paralyzed
the government institutions have been defending themselves by accusing each other
are the plans to raise electricity and gas prices not a joke with the public
why is the attention not being paid to the solution of the problems
is the government not seeing the stalling of the national development
what immediate steps will you propose to control this crisis
please post your opinion
imran khokhar madina munawara i want to say that the rulers are a reflection of the people

the law and order situation is getting worse day by day may god have mercy on this country
the new year has begun
the previous year was the year of turmoil and political upheavals it will also be remembered for terrorism
president musharrafs separation from power and the end of president bushs 8 years reign the shoeflinging at bush and the establishment of a democratic government in pakistan unwarranted catastrophes earthquake in baluchistan financial crisis in the whole world and the recession

the first death anniversary of benazir bhutto shaheed is being commemorated she was martyred in liaqat bagh of rawalpindi after an election procession on december 27 2007
benazir is not among us today she was an intellectual a politician and a world famous personality she had a unique status in national politics
even after one year the riddle of her assassination could not be solved
her hard work for the establishment of democracy and the government in pakistan did not go in vain
a democratic government is established in pakistan today and her husband asif zardari is the president of pakistan
in what light do you view benazir bhutto shaheeds role in pakistani politics
who could have a hand in her assassination
recently she was given international award for human rights what would you like to say about her political and democratic services
after ruling over america for 8 years president bush departed from the white house and settled in the presidential camp office at camp david so that the white house could be decorated and prepared according to the wishes of the new president barack obama
during the eight years of bushs reign as president the historic attack on world trade centre and its destruction attack on pentagon and then dragging the military forces of various countries in by launching military action against afghanistan and iraq and full use of american resources in this war on the pretext of world war against terrorism became the memorable examples of the bush era
because of this war america itself had to face the worst economic and financial crisis in the history
what in your opinion did the world gain and lose in this war
were the policies of president bush successful
what is your opinion on the bush era
indian government has stopped indian cricket team from touring pakistan
indian cricket team had to play three tests five one day matches and one twenty20 match during its tour to pakistan
the vice president of indian cricket board mr rajiv shukla told geo news that the board had sought permission from the government to tour pakistan but owing to the recent tense situation between the two countries the tour was not possible
is indian governments cancellation of the cricket teams tour on the pretext of recent political situation a correct step should the sports not be separated from the politics
is indian governments decision not harmful to cricket
why can indian team not tour pakistan while the english cricket team continued its tour of india despite worsening of the security situation

those who are proud of going to india
and star in their films or get their videos filmed there should now understand how much the indian people respect them
i remember an interview of adnan sami in which he had said that he was not a pakistani and he had british nationality
adnan sami should come to pakistan straight away because he could not savor respect in india too
farid ahmad
karachi
the behavior of the indians has changed after the mumbai attacks
jagjit singh has expressed his reaction by saying that he hates pakistan and the pakistanis
it should be noted that adnan sami has sung duets with asha bhosle how come he has become an out of tune singer now adnan sami should live in india he does not need to come here
muhammad shamshad alam
karachi i would say only this on jagjit singhs statement that he changes color like a chameleon
who gives statements according to the situation o pakistanis open your eyes and see how much you are respected in india understand the mentality of the hindu
their hateful statements are coming at a greater frequency after mumbais incident now they are uttering bullshit against the famous singer adnan sami
after this the journalist took off one of his shoes and threw it at bush president bush ducked skillfully before the shoe could hit him and saved himself
the second shoe hit the american flag
the security personnel dragged the journalist out of the place
on this occasion president bush said that he did not know why he did so the shoe was of size 10 and he had no problem
was in your opinion this act of the journalist not a reflection of iraqi publics show of anger towards president bush
what would you say about this incident
the tension that was created in pakindia relations after the terrorism incident in mumbai became severe when the air planes of indian air force violated the pakistani air space in lahore and kashmir sectors
the indian planes were forced to retreat by the retaliation from pakistan air force
according to the sources both the indian planes were equipped with arms and ammunition
this is the first incident of its kind during the present tense situation
pakistan air force has said that the air force is fully prepared to defend the country
information minister sherry rehman has said that the indian authorities have conceded that the air space was violated but this happened by mistake
the military sources in pakistan have termed the incident as serious
do you think that india seriously intends to launch an air strike against pakistan
is indian point of view correct that this happened by mistake or was this aimed at assessing the ability of pakistan air force
will this incident not increase the tension between the two countries

it is true that she was martyred but we also remember that she killed many innocent people in karachi she used to be proud of the fact that naseerullah babar had done a great job

may god give sense to our rulers
the panel of united nations security council has included the names of three pakistani citizens including hafiz muhammad saeed and five organizations including jamaatuddawah in the list of terrorists
the pakistanis whose names al qaeda and taliban sanctions committee of the security council has approved for inclusion in the list of terrorists include the emir of jamaatuddawah hafiz muhammad saeed operations chief of the banned lashkaretaiba zakiurrehman lakhvi and the head of the finance department haji muhammad ashraf
besides the name of a saudi citizen mahmoud ahmad bazek is also included in the terrorists list
the organizations include jamaatuddawah paasbanekashmir al rasheed trust and al akhtar trust international
the member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these persons and organizations and they will be barred from traveling and will be arrested
they will have to face cases
are these sanctions not an outcome of the indian propaganda
why is india accusing these organizations of the mumbai attacks in absence of any proof
are there no terrorist organizations in india
