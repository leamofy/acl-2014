this book has been written with the title nuclear expressa political history of the bomb and its proliferation and in this both the authors have claimed that any country that has made an atomic bomb has either stolen the nuclear secrets of another country or has had cooperation with some other nuclear power
thomas reed said in an interview to us news that in 1990 in the era of benazir bhutto china had conducted the experiment of pakistans first nuclear bomb
thomas reed said that he is convinced on the basis of several reasons that china has conducted the experiment of pakistans first nuclear bomb
those reasons include the design of the bomb and information obtained while talking to the scientists of china

none of the members belonging to the republican party voted in favor of this plan of president obama
the republican members were of the view that this economic plan was very expensive and would not prove effective
244 votes in favor and 188 votes against this package were cast in the house of representatives
this plan of economic recovery is going to be presented to the senate next week where the ruling democratic party has an extremely slim majority
it is feared that due to the severe opposition from the republican party its approval would not be easy from the senate
after the approval of the economic recovery plan in the house of representativesbarack obama insisted to the members that they should not allow political differences to become a barrier to this important plan
the president said that this plan which he expects to be transformed into a bill by next month would prove to be helpful in making the environment favorable in the country in which american trade will flourish
through this plan 276 billion dollars will be given for the relief in the loans for common men and the business community while 540 billion will be given for roads bridges the renovation of 10000 schools unemployment allowance and research in new technology
bbc correspondent richard lester said in washington that barack obama had a determination of introducing a new political culture by burying political differences but the arguments on this economic package have once again created tension on a political basis
the members of the republican party in the house of representatives have declared this bill proposed by the government a waste of government money and said that this would not help in creating any new opportunities for employment
they insisted on the bill proposed by their party in which there is more emphasis on tax relief
they said that through their package more employment opportunities could be created with far less investment
they said that compared to developmental projects more employment opportunities could be created instantly with the relief in the taxes
tension between israeli president and turkish prime minister
rajab tayyab argan said to the israeli president almost yelling that blood has been shed of many people in gaza and he felt sorry to see that people could even applaud the military action from israel
mr argan said it looks to me that probably you are using these words to reduce your sense of guilt and that too on a high note but you have killed people and i am remembering those children who were killed near the coastline
shimon peres said that the tragedy of gaza was not inflicted by israel but it was due to hamas which has established a dangerous dictatorship over there
bbc correspondent says from davos that such type of scene has never been seen before in an international economic forum
however argan said afterwards that he respected the israeli president and also his elderliness due to which he did not yell at him but whatever he was saying was far from the truth
turkey is one of the few muslim countries which has diplomatic relations with israel but a tension has existed in these relations for the last few years

wajid shamsulhasan said pakistani territory has not been used according to the conclusions reached by the investigators so far

these were the two places (pakistan and britain) i was concerned about
india and the international community have put enough pressure on pakistan to take action against those who are responsible for the mumbai attacks pakistan says that it has arrested dozens of people in the action against groups allegedly involved in the mumbai attacks
wajid shamsulhasan said we are not trying to cover it
we believe in acting on the facts
our investigations will be acceptable to the world

european unions role in middle east peace
if seen from the official perspective the european unions role in reconciliation efforts to stop the middle east war is decisive
according to the brussels government stand efforts of the schwarzenberg delegation or sarkozys are synonymous to help in this task
the spokesman of the european commission amadeu altafaj said that all such efforts through which sending a joint message to the warring parties from the european union could be helpful are worthy of praise
everything looks fine from the perspective of the official statement
but in reality the european union is presenting a regretful picture of the internal tug of war
the role of the czech republic as the president of the union is already weak
on top of this the internal wrangling has made it helpless
on the other hand the french president sarkozy is acting like he is still discharging the duties as the president of the european union
although france has already completed its sixmonth presidential tenure
sarkozy wants to play the lead role and he can do it but he is not permitted for this
the most embarrassing situation is being faced by french foreign minister bernard kouchner
he is in the delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of the czech republic schwarzenberg
and on top of this both foreign ministers are giving different statements about the middle east war
kouchner says that israel has a right of selfdefense while according to schwarzenberg this war does not come under self defense in the meantime germany has also sent its special envoy to the middle east until the european union shows harmony based on similar point of views it cannot succeed on the diplomatic front
the proof of this is the attitude of israel which does not give any importance to the reconciliation efforts of europe
this is the golden opportunity for the european union to accomplish something as america has already failed in the middle east due to the policies of george w bush
economic crisis billionaire german industrialist commits suicide
although adolf merckle a resident of the area of swabia of south germany has left a huge business group after him
but the common german citizens did not know much about him up until a little while ago
then when he had to negotiate with about 30 banks for many weeks which provided loans to his business group he became the subject of the headlines and the future of merckle group also looked to bleak him
merckle group also had to bear a loss of hundreds of millions of euros due to the financial crisis after buying shares of german car manufacturing company volkswagen
and when the financial institutions denied the new loans valued at between 700 million and onebillion euros mandatorily needed by this group merckle came under severe stress
sometime back these very banks had agreed to provide loans to merckle group on an emergency basis however adolf merckle who had risen to such heights from a small industrialist that his groups income had become around 30 billion euros could not bear the loss of his investment power
when adolf merckle took charge of his family business after the death of his father he managed it on the modern lines and gave it a tremendous boost
he named his company ratiopharm which is an extremely successful and very large pharmaceutical firm of germany today
until sometime ago the business worth of this pharmaceutical firm was between 5 and 6 billion euros and even now it earns 18 billion euros annually after the huge success of ratiopharm merckle group purchased many large firms which included a company named heidelberg cement manufacturing construction materials to the company named kaessbohrer which manufactures a special type of vehicles
the number of the employees of merckle group around the globe is onehundred thousand and in its assets ratiopharm the drug manufacturing company has always held special importance
adolf merckle had said this many times in his life we have been manufacturing drugs for four generations
now the management of this firm is in the hands of my children and i hope that this firm will still remain under my familys management for a few hundred years
after the suicide of adolf merckle banks have approved interim loans worth 400 million euros for his group vem but on the condition that vem has to sell ratiopharm so that the financial condition of this group could be improved on a longterm basis
this way after the death of adolf merckle the merckle group would not remain the same like it used to be
crime rate among foreigners in germany
according to joachim herrmann the interior minister of bavaria province this is apparently a mere positive change
he said it should be kept in mind that the number of foreigners seeking german nationality is increasing
therefore this fact should also be mentioned in the statistics that although the person who commits a crime is a german heshe also has a foreign background
herrmann said that from 2010 his province will keep this fact in mind while collecting statistics about criminals
besides bavaria the province of hamburg is also thinking on the same lines
senator for interior affairs christoph ahlhaus of cdu said when investigations are done according to the scientific method a person cannot compile results beforehand as per hisher own will instead the results depend on the statistics which come after the investigations have been completed
ahlhaus drew attention to an analytical report of a provincial crime control office which was prepared in 2006 and according to which it was investigated that in bergdorf a part of the city of hamburg what percentage of the foreigners is involved in the crimes taking place there
the results have shown that here foreigners
rate of crime is lower as compared to the crimes taking place in the whole province
contrary to this when in berlin in 2006 the rate of crime in youngsters was reviewed it was found that the percentage of youngsters having foreign background was 44
7 percent
however the other political parties of germany for example linkspartei the party of environmentalists greens and the leftist party spd are against this proposal that while collecting statistics related to crimes this information should also be collected in which german citizens have a foreign background
we want army evacuation from gaza soon olmert
ehud olmert insisted that a permanent and stable ceasefire agreement is indispensible for complete evacuation of the army
hamas and israel announced a ceasefire on sunday

al qaedas video message for germany
in this video of 30 minutes duration one person wearing a black turban mask on the face and holding a gun in his hand is giving a message to the german government
this person is introducing himself with the name abu talha and is conversing in german language
this video message also has arabic subtitles
al qaedas logo appears on the side of the screen and the video has the date of october 2008
in this message this has been conveyed to the german government that if they were exhibiting confidence that they would not be attacked due to deployment of such a huge army in afghanistan they are sadly mistaken and ignorant
this person calling himself abu talha has however not given a threat to germany of direct attacks
the number of german soldiers in the nato coalition army deployed at this time in afghanistan is around threethousand fivehundred
last year in october the german parliament approved a bill sending 1000 more soldiers to afghanistan
this is the first message from al qaeda to germany
prominent expert having insight in affairs pertaining to terrorism michael luders says with reference to this message the recent suicidal attack outside the german embassy in kabul is a testimony that we should take it seriously under any circumstance
for the last few years al qaeda has been issuing video messages on the internet and there have also been attacks after such messages
the militant organization the taliban has taken responsibility of the suicidal attack that occurred on saturday outside the german embassy in kabul
most of the german newspapers and observers are looking at this attack together with al qaedas message
they are targeting germany
the fundamentalist muslims see germanys afghan policy with critical eyes and as negative
they blame the german government for adopting discriminatory policies not only in afghanistan but also in the middle east
and because of this reason they are taking germany more and more as their target
in the meantime the german government says that the german intelligence agency already knew about this video even before it became public
a german federal crimes control agency is busy examining this video
obama has taken charge of the american presidency
in this perspective not only the american public but the whole world has reposed different expectations in obama
now when obama is getting felicitation messages from the whole world on becoming the president of america the expectations associated with him are also coming forth
with this reference german chancellor angela merkel has shown confidence in the new american president
i am sure that on the basis of profound friendship and cooperation between the federal republic of germany and the united states of america we can solve the challenges faced
the russian prime minister vladimir putin says that obama looks like a sober and openhearted person and this is definitely a good sign
although the policies of the former american president george w bush have always been criticized
nonetheless his administration is definitely praised for encouraging china to play a more constructive role at the international level whereas china has said about the new american president that he has to work for a strong military relationship between the two countries
an active chinese political expert in the german city bochum goo sui woo says
in this perspective i am sure that in the coming weeks and months obama and his financial team will exert extreme pressure to force the beijing government to adopt a flexible and marketcompatible exchange rate for the chinese currency
the former american administration has also furthered its relationship with india
where obama can take this relationship to the professor of american studies in new delhi prof christopher raj says about it we have come very close in the strategic partnership however obama cannot bring any change overnight
pope benedict has also insisted in his message to obama for the promotion of an atmosphere of peace and cooperation in the world

today in the ajlain area the shroudbearer mujahideen compelled the israeli forces to retreat and are showing magnificent rectitude and steadfastness with the power of faith and martyrdom and are narrowing in the life on the jewish enemies
if the egyptian president hosni mubarak had not been a traitor the proud and brave mujahideen of hamas would have defeated israel long ago but along with the israeli siege egypt has also besieged palestinian muslims which is the most sorrowful episode in arab history
meanwhile the governments of saudi arabia and jordan are also providing political and financial support to israel and taking the side of israel while deceiving unarmed muslims of gaza

the american president defended his aggressive and wrong policies while putting aside the grief and misery of hundreds of thousands of palestinians the american president said that america is still the biggest country supporting freedom however the observers dont accept that these statements of the hated american president are true because america is neither a flagbearer of freedom nor is it a supporter of human rights instead america is the most mischievous country in the world supporting not only a predator government like that of israel but also directly participating in these crimes
israel is carrying out the massacres of children women and common citizens and the american president is applauding her the world is watching this american humanity and freedom in gaza and other places of the world

provincial government of nwfp rejects the demand of ban on girls education in sawat
the officials of nwfp province have rejected the threat from taliban militants in sawat of putting a ban on girls education by saying that this announcement is against both the law and islam
on sunday the education minister of nwfp sardar hussain babak further said that the government will never allow these efforts to succeed
he said that the extremists want the children in our area to remain deprived of education
in his words they try secretly to blow up schools and threaten the boys and girls
talking about the atmosphere of fear and harassment he said that the provincial government is well aware of it and wants to make it clear that no power can deter the promotion of education on the land of pukhtoons
a day earlier the taliban militants led by maulana fazlullah demanded a ban on girls education in the educational institutions of sawat from january 15 and threatened that the violating educational institutions would be destroyed
despite the continued army operation in the last one and a half years about 150 educational institutions have been blown up with explosives and fire by the militants
consequent upon the destruction of these educational institutions thousands of boys and girls have been deprived of the facility of education

tea effective treatment for breast cancer
in a new research it has been said that three cups of tea
if taken daily reduces the risk of breast cancer by more than one third in women aged less than 50 years
in this research done in the moffitt cancer center in the state of florida in america it has been said that the risk of cancer of the breast tumor in the women aged under 50
in the research it was also said that the women of higher age dont get any noticeable benefits in this regard by taking three or more cups of tea daily
the experts say that the reason of this is the presence of some elements in the tea that are effective against those tumors which occur in the women of less than 50 years
this research was done on more than fivethousand women who were treated for breast cancer in the moffitt cancer center situated in the city of tampa in the state of florida
the experts compared their medical records and their lifestyle with those of the women who were safe from breast cancer
the experts also came to know that tea visibly showed its effect on a special type of cancer lobular which was reduced up to 66 percent
every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type
this type of cancer is dangerous because of the reason that it is deepseated and usually it is diagnosed when it has already widely spread
the experts say that drinking at least three cups of tea daily on a regular basis may reduce the risk of breast cancer conspicuously in younger women
they say that a proper defense is developed in the body against cancer if tea is included in the daily routine as a routine drink
in britain every year about 40thousand women are diagnosed with breast cancer

why less exercise with increasing age
new research
exercise is good for health at every age
it makes your heart energetic lowers the cholesterol level helps in keeping weight low helps in controlling diabetes and slows the process of alzheimers meaning forgetfulness
unfortunately in many people with increasing age the ability to do exercise is reduced
the experts say that exercise keeps our body and mind alert however age can affect this
according to the american medical association if exercise is not done many health problems may be encountered
dr patricia palika of mayo clinic minnesota says that increasing age is a major cause of difficulty in doing exercises and reduction in bodily performance
dr patricia teaches medicine at the mayo clinic
she led research regarding heart problems and the ability of humans in doing exercise in old age
the team of the doctors used high frequency sonic waves to assess the performance of the heart
in which they studied the pumping of blood its contraction and the resting process of the heart
the experts focused their attention on the left side of the heart which is the main part in the pumping of blood
they came to know that with the increase in age the problems are increased in the resting process of the heart
dr patricia says that with increasing age the problems in the resting process of the heart become visible and the effect on the ability of doing exercise increases with the increase in age
dr garvin cain participated in this study
he says that we were surprised to see that this necessarily affects and it became clear that bad performance in the exercise can be so much associated with the resting process of the heart
sometimes blood pressure can cause problems in the heart process and ailments of the heart
if doctors and the patients work together with reference to the ailments of the heart they can get the benefits of exercise even with increasing age
the detailed report with reference to this has been published in the journal of the american medical association
no chances of immediate war with pakistan indian army chief
the chief of the indian army general deepak kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with pakistan however to defend the country and to assure the safety of its interests we are ready at all times for giving sacrifices
general kapoor blamed that despite reassurances and pressure from the international community on pakistan as a result of the mumbai attacks in his words the infrastructure of terrorism is not only intact on pakistani soil but is also active
he said this while talking to news correspondents in srinagar
the chief of the indian army was on a oneday visit to the valley of kashmir to review the collective security situation and the preparations of the army on the borders in kashmir under the new delhi administration
he was asked what his comments were in reference to the media reports that pakistan has rejected the proof presented by india with reference to the mumbai attacks
general kapoor said that the decisions on the matter pertaining to war and peace are taken by the political leadership
talking about the alleged infrastructure of terrorism present on pakistani soil he said that the indian army will face those elements who are determined to disrupt peace and to weaken india
he said that sevenhundred to eighthundred militants are present in the indian kashmir out of which about fifty percent are foreigners
general deepak kapoor said that with better weather conditions the effort of influx from pakistan and kashmir under pakistans administration may increase however india has enhanced alert on the borders
he rejected the possibility of reduction in the strength of the army deployed in the indianadministered kashmir by saying that the security of the country could not be compromised
may allah bless the world opinion and barack proves to be a blessing for the world
although we are not hopeful still let us see to what extent this change brings pakistaniamerican relations to our favor
as barack sahib is an interpretation of martin luther kings dreams what interpretation he gives to the world
obama a part of whose name is also hussein his taking an oath today as president of america is an historic event and also a difficult test for history
not only for his own self but also for all those who supported him with their heart and soul
this will be a test for the white majority also because it is not an easy task for them to accept from their hearts the government of a black man over them
here the people of south asia especially the muslims who have pinned hopes on him should bear in mind that he has been elected as the president of america and obama should keep in mind that the president of america is practically the president of the world
after a while from now a person the people of whose ethnic origin were brought to america as slaves from their respective homelands and who offered their sweat and blood to the roots of the worlds most powerful modern state today the representative of the same racially subjected nation will be called the fortyfourth president of this very america
many people have pinned many hopes on this person
it is important for his fans not to repose unrealistic hopes from him
if obama is able to emerge successful in some way in just alleviating the hatred spread in the world on the bases like religion and race then this will be the success of his lovers
what will be the effect of this change on south asia and whether a meaningful change can be expected in american policy as a result of this change
how is this policy going to impact pakistaniamerican relations
my lord whether it is obama or anybody else only the billionaire effective strong and resourceful jewish lobby determines the nature of policy and relationship regarding the whole world
and as far as pakistan is concerned in the context of recent mumbai blasts the aggressive attitude of the india israel and american triangles is open to the whole world
even after the creation of pakistan for a considerably long period of time the administration of sawat was the responsibility of waliesawat who maintained a regular force and law
under an agreement he handed over the administration of sawat to the government of pakistan
but alas our government treated sawat like a stepmother
after waliesawats government was over there has been no increase in the number of schools in sawat
and no interest was taken in the construction and development of that area
the number of girls currently getting an education is several times less than those who used to get education in the past
the local taliban continue to target educational institutions in nwfp pakistan
the maximum number of schools that have been destroyed lie in sawat district most amongst them are girls schools
not only this the taliban have also announced a ban on the education of girls in sawat
thousands of male and female students are being deprived of education
what in your opinion the taliban want to achieve by banning female education
why has the government so far failed to control these illegal measures
what in your opinion should the government do
the question should be what the isi and pakistani agencies will get
because the people of sawat have clearly understood now the game that the army is there to serve the taliban and not for killing them otherwise how can five schools be blasted in a single night during curfew and how can the people be hanged in the main city crossing after cutting their throats during curfew
when the government authority is not being allowed to be established in sawat then in these circumstances how can the government be successful in controlling these illegal measures
now the question arises when the government has the army the latest weapons the modern technology and surveillance system then why are they unable to control a few taliban
the only answer to this question is that they are being protected by some unknown power because neither their ammunition gets exhausted nor they get caught
the gist of the issue is that these taliban with their wicked deeds are facilitating the job of international powers
there was war going on in afghanistan fifteen years ago
isi was controlling the taliban whereas the rival was northern alliance which was supported by russia india and iran
then suddenly the circumstances changed and the talibans evil agenda started coming to light
and isi also got dollars offer from america and as such former friends became enemies
the current situation is that the war is still continuing but in pakistan supporters are the same eg iran india and russia
unless a man starts feeling the difference between right and wrong he will continue to make mistakes
for example when a thief attempts a theft and at that time he gets a feeling that theft is not a good thing and it is a curse and involves punishment and he fears god then he will not commit theft
in a similar way unless israel develops a feeling that it is doing wrong and killing innocent people and will be punished for this until that time israel will continue to play with the blood of innocent people in gaza
greetings
the question is if war armed struggle terrorism are the solutions to problems
if not then what is the chemical formula that leads towards the solution of the problems
it is true that war and terrorist methods do not solve problems but increase them
for the success of their movements palestine afghanistan and iraq should follow the same model that nelson mandela adopted in south africa
this means more than an armed struggle pursuing the path of moral and political struggles and self jihad
taking part in the election indicates that kashmiris have accepted this point
gaza is passing through the third week of israeli attacks and the number of killings has reached about 1000
despite international diplomatic efforts there is no ceasefire yet
and according to an estimate since the start of attacks on december 27 till now 90000 palestinians have moved to safer places after abandoning their homes
the reliefproviding agencies have blamed israel for showing negligence for the safety of palestinian children saying that a full generation of palestinian children will be subjected to psychological and emotional troubles
what do you say
how can a durable peace be achieved in gaza

the taliban should be given the opportunity
basit peshawar
be alert if the taliban started real jihad then who will cut the throats of innocent people
who will burn girls schools
and if ransom money is not paid then who will hang people with poles labeling them american agents
these talibans have damaged islam so much so that none of the religions or nations has done so
pashtun nomad
kohat pakistan
if the entire global muslim community together issues just a threat of attack to israel then you will see how much trouble america israels dad will feel
and not only will the talks for real ceasefire begin immediately but also the ceasefire will take place
but we cannot do anything because our muslim rulers dont have the courage for this
someone should ask ahmadinejad to take a first step because he is popular with the bbc forum for his valor
the responsibility for the establishment of peace and human rights not only rests with arabs or muslims of the world it is also the responsibility of the entire international community to raise its voice against aggression
this horrific incident is the nastiest of all the sins bush has committed so far
as happens in india and pakistan financial corruption starts in government institutions before the close of the fiscal year on 30 june in exactly similar style the american administration before the close up of its government has given the green light to israel to do whatever it has a desire to do
on one hand america says that efforts will be made for the ceasefire
on the other hand the united nations is passing resolution after resolution but in practice both have done nothing this only means that the un is also trying to crush the muslims
all the muslim countries should immediately withdraw their membership of the un and lay the foundation of their own international organization
there are many examples before us where we only see promises and resolutions from america and the united nations but the loss has only been for the muslims
what is the purpose of these tactics when the bbc wants to print nothing
where have now these journalistic principles gone when the blood of an innocent muslim sheds bbc tries to covers itself with the fake principle of impartiality
otherwise in their opinion they are the torch bearer of justice
saying something from their own side cannot be expected of them but they are not even printing comments
the only difference between you and the jews is that they call themselves jews and they kill muslims whereas people like you live among muslims call yourself a muslim and kill the muslims
syja786
since long in bbc forums a specific sect is being targeted sometimes on the pretext of suicide bombings and sometimes on account of terrorist activities in india
in these antiislam commentaries the favorite word used is extremism
but who is extremist can be easily judged from the above comments in which writing against iran has almost been considered to be an act of blasphemy
when will our muslims understand that fighting with dejal is not possible by sword
looking at the bombing by israel on unarmed people prompts our hearts to do what else other than to cry
but the basic fault lies with that violence and killings to which we give the name of jihad and try to tarnish the beautiful face of islam
when a majority of palestinians have accepted the existence of israel then why is hamas firing rockets on israel and sponsoring suicide bombings
an inhumane attitude exists on both sides
the american and the un roles are again seen as the supporters of israeli brutality
may allah empower the muslim ummah to become united ameen
and think about awarding the nobel prize to the real terrorists for terming this painful terrorist activity as a campaign against terrorism because they are the real masterminds
how can such largescale terrorist activities be carried out without the backing of a big leader and everyone knows how the people behind this game
and in such circumstances it is called might is right in a simple language to do whatever you can do
they beat us and we arent even allowed to cry
arab rulers are sending medicine for the injured coffins and money for those who died and it is being asked
what should be done about israeli attacks
the real issue is that all heads of muslim states including the rulers of saudi arabia are gripped in deep ignorance they have neither any army nor a defense plan they just assume that by providing relief goods their responsibility is over
they should immediately take practical steps against israel
for example a ban on petrol for european countries and america but sadly in them
greetings to all sisters and brothers
in my opinion in this hour of trial giving suggestion to hamas to give up its efforts in the name of peace is like doing injustice to hundreds of thousands of widows and orphans and it is like proving that they are a failure
if israel and its supporters have crossed all boundaries of injustice then the law of nature is that moses will emerge from their own ranks american and israeli measures are acting like fertilizer for creating suicide bombers amongst the muslims
due to a false confidence in power they are unable to understand this reality
abu abdullah pakistan
hamas and israel should now reconcile so that bloodshed is stopped
mohammad sarfraz paris france
correctly said
let us suppose that hamas point of view is based on 100 truth and by doing jihad against aggression they wish to come up with flying colors before allah then at least they must know that if as a result of this good action wellsettled houses are deserted then this will no longer remain a good deed
those who love god and his prophet and claim to have love for their faith then love for human beings must also be a part and parcel of their faith
as if leaving the muslims alone all those believing in allahs book and living on this earth should be exterminated is the command of god
najeeburrehman sieko lahore pkitn
no the command is not to exterminate them but to invite them to accept islam
but for those people who conspire against religion it has been commanded to do jihad against them
fighting against those should be continued till they stop conspiring but that in no way means to wear a jacket and explode in a gathering
brothers the murderer of innocent children will eventually face destruction
but i want to tell my friends that israelis who were without a shelter yesterday have become so strong today that they do not care for anybody because the jews are all united
there are no shias or sunnis in their ranks they are all jews and have progressed in all fields
contrary to this what is the condition of the 55 muslim countries
they are lagging behind in all fields and they have become so helpless at this stage that enemies are beating them and they are waiting for death
the need of the hour is that all muslim countries should get together and formulate a strategy against israel
feroz magsi jhang pakistan
and there is no other better strategy than acknowledging israel getting from them modern knowledge and techniques for development and allowing the world to live with peace and tranquility
the muslims have plenty of land and resources
only the correct use is required
the first distressing aspect is that hamas and al fateh cannot stand united
yasser arafat and sheikh yassin were killed in an organized way just to weaken the only brave nation of this piece of land who is doing jihad for masjid aqsa and as long as yassin and arafat were not put out of way this was not possible
after the death of these two leaders the world is watching how palestine is dispersing moment by moment
and how the jewish lobby went on tightening its grip moment by moment
in 1974 a prime minister from pakistan possessed such a level of international credibility that for the first time in history he made all the muslim leaders come under one roof with hundred percent attendance
today on his 81st birthday is this a difficult task if this nation resolves not only to bring unity in its ranks and files
but also carry forward his unaccomplished mission (of establishment of a muslim commonwealth) by removing the differences among other muslims
this is a devil sticking to palestine since half a century
this devil has several mouths
on several occasions this devil uses one of its mouths to condemn itself to divert the world pressure and attention
the same devils other mouths are eating people in iraq afghanistan iran and pakistan
and this devil is more afraid of islam than anything else because it knows that whenever it is expelled it will be only and only due to islam muslim complete muslim faith and practical islam because history tells that islam diverted many illmannered people to the right track
since december 27 the israeli war plans have been to continuously bomb and attack gaza with missiles
in these attacks so far more than threehundred palestinian people have been killed
after air raids israeli tanks and armored vehicles with full preparation for ground operations have now reached the gaza boundary
the security council of the united nations in an emergency meeting adopted a consensus resolution in which israel and the palestinian authority have been asked to immediately stop hostile measures
israeli authorities have however said that they will continue with the operations within gaza until they get an assurance that rocket firing on israel will stop
in your opinion is israel justified in saying that this action is an effort to defend the integrity of israel
is the international community playing its role in this state of affairs
does this aggressive action have any indirect link with the upcoming elections in israel
can the situation in the middle east be expected to improve after barack obama the newly elected president of america takes the oath of his office
(please note that due to the increased number of comments only the opinions typed in urdu will be published

palestine is a highly venerated place for the muslims until the last day of this world and its protection is of paramount importance to us
and we must also remember that it our first qibla
and israel india and america will break up one day because these countries came into being only for a breakup and god will surely punish these nonbelievers sajid sadiq lahore
cutting a sorry figure cannot be a solution to the problem
prayers alone cannot turn the devil away (nawabzada nasrullah) khan)
bbc publishes such commentaries after searching a lot
after all it has to maintain its credibility and impression of impartiality
though the bbc news is correct the real thing is news analysis
which news is to be given importance and which news is to be made less important
etc etc
zaheer chughtai
in this skill our pakistani electronic and print media particularly some urdu newspapers and columnists are now not behind in this race who while giving coverage to increasing extremism and terrorism here or writing about it intentionally give a distorted view of the things based on their own mindset
where is the united nations who apparently talks about human rights and peace but brutality and aggression against the muslims reaches at its peak and we hear these very words from them asking hamas to end fighting for how long will this dual policy continue to operate
why is so much brutality being committed against the muslims if people like america cease to back the jews then allah has clearly said that they will live the life of a humiliated nation and this nation can never live a right life then americans if you have courage then quit backing them and then see the life of their fortune
the socalled judges of the world and those who justify killings in the name of peace must clearly understand that peace in the world can only be established by dispensing justice and not through injustice and ethnic cleansing
if the acquisition of the intended result would have been possible through the elimination of a particular human race by mass genocide then there would have been no jews left alive after the measures that hitler took and their rise today would have been impossible
in the words of a poet
brutality is darkness which when increases gets vanished
blood is an ink which when drops becomes everlasting
now who will tell who what is terrorism
does this all not come under the definition of terrorism why everyone feels only his own pain
are other people not human beings or the blood of the muslims have become so cheap was the blood color of so many innocents not red
and why arent any messages of condolence coming from anywhere now
i saw the happenings of the mumbai attacks just as if my own home had caught fire that the pains of human beings cannot be seen and does nobody not see this pain may it so happen that the muslims start thinking unitedly
dead bodies lying on the road helpless injured and innocent faces dipped in a bloodbath how to condemn as we dont have words for this
we feel like weeping on the helpless state of the muslims as on one hand when people are killed in india the whole world rushes towards pakistan without proof urging to take action or otherwise they will take action themselves
on the other hand israel is openly eliminating the muslims and the world is silent this is unbearable
with allah there is a delay but no injustice and when this brutality will end then
in the presence of america danger to israels stability is a joke
as far as election is concerned for earning public popularity the people in power may carry on with this type of activity no doubt in that particularly the state of israel and as far as barack obama is concerned history stands witness to the fact that until today no american leader went against the policy and will not do so in the future imperialism being black or white makes no difference at all
the current discussion in the forum indicates that everyone feels pain for the death of benazir but as a politician her mistakes have not been overlooked
whether benazir give her life for democracy or for the government is still a debatable question
if she had a love for democracy then why did she wait for ten years until american clearance and finalization of a deal while leaving democratic institutions to be looked after by musharrafs dictatorship
benazir did not come to pakistan at a time when people affected with dictatorship needed her but unfortunately she came only when sureties of clearance from court cases and power were given
there is no one to raise any voice against the criticism and allegations being leveled upon an historic person

certain things are ignored on the grounds that nothing can be done about them

the united kingdom did not allow them to become united and invented the hindu muslim conflict which was groomed by sir syed
sieko
our nation is so unkind that they become blind while writing praises about themselves and in the honor of their parties but now every historical person is being subjected to so much allegations and criticism and no one is raising their voices against this
we have made enough progress

certain things are ignored considering that nothing can be done about them in a similar way loading books on the back of a donkey cannot make it learned
although in the wake of mumbai attacks a deadlock has occurred in the continuing consultations processes but pakindia should keep these consultations ongoing
if they will talk about war then there will be loss of human lives on both sides
india says that the person caught in the mumbai attacks is from pakistan and he has also written and sent a letter to pakistan in urdu but on the other hand when india got hold of this extremist they said that he is a highlyqualified engineer but later on they said that he is educated only up to four class this is strange
first of all merry christmas to bhana sahib and all christian friends of this forum
greetings to forum friends sieko sahib a raza sister sana sister shahida akram and all
all of us need flowers of peace and not flames of war
war is itself a problem
war cannot give solution to problems
today it will generate blood and fire
tomorrow it will give hunger and poverty
and therefore wise people
it is better to postpone the war
in yours and our courtyards
better light continue to stay
indiaamerica relations have become sufficiently deeper and india certainly understands that in the hour of need america will openly deceive pakistan
this is the old history of america
whereas in the case of the indian attacks america will achieve its objectives and that too at the indian cost
pakistan should clearly announce that we will not be the first to attack but in case of aggression the talks for peace reconciliations and ceasefire will take place only when we have either completely destroyed india or have occupied it no matter if we ourselves get completely destroyed
this is the islamic history
even before this resolution the pakistan army and the public has already conveyed the message that they wanted to pass on
indian efforts in seeking compensation for the mumbai attacks in terms of extraordinary diplomatic and military benefits indicate that it is crying more than it was originally affected that is why contrary to initial strong international reaction the world has now released pressure on pakistan
the united nations paying no heed to needless indian cries and expressing satisfaction over pakistans efforts and the head of interpol praising pakistans efforts are the side effects of indias unnecessary diplomatic efforts
there are no two opinions that this is a severe brutal act
but the question is that when thousands of taliban attacked the village of pir samiullah where was the pakistan army at that time and what it was doing
should the army not be held accountable for what they did during the oneyear stay over there
how may taliban are killed with thousands of mortar and gun shells that the army sprays each day
and close up this bogus operation
that day is not far when a un resolution for armed intervention in pakistan will be passed in a similar way as has been in the case of jamaat aldawa
first of all our extremists and their supporters are themselves continuously providing all proofs and justifications for action against them and it is clear that whenever such a resolution is presented in the united nations no voice will be raised in our favor
and if the passing of such a resolution gets delayed then any of the powers following the example of america will run over us on the basis of selfhelp
we are not aware and have no information about the personality and achievements of pir samiullah
perhaps he was not a revolutionary
the matter in which the dead bodies of comrade che guevara nawab akbar bugti doctor najeebullah and several thousand other revolutionart were insulted by enemies
they are alive even after death
but here an international game is being played and the people are being ruled by making them afraid of terror and brutality
a justification is being created that if we are not here then the terrorists and fanatics will take over the reign of government
this act of these socalled islam lovers in the name of religion is highly deplorable
the supporters of these extremists can see the aggressions of america but instead of cutting a sorry figure on brutal actions like this one they give it the name of a tribal culture and in this way change track
a person with a good heart cannot provide justifications for this type of brutal act neither under the umbrella of tribal culture nor in the name of islam
in my opinion our army is supporting these people
it is because when these people move it surely takes time there is enough time to arrest them but they run away even if they are present at the occasion let alone reaching the spot
are they so brave that they hold fifty seventy people as hostages and our army watches them as a spectator doing nothing
both the army and these people are allahs creation
it is evident that something is black at the bottom
the religious scholars since the truly dictatorial regime of dictator of the world ziaulhaq contrary to projecting gods attributes of kindness and affection have been creating an atmosphere of fear and terror by telling countless stories of punishments and admonitions in the name of religion in which the incident of hanging dead bodies and additionally their literature and books like what will happen after death are also creating fear and terror
and with a purpose to gain worldly prestige these people are using fear and terror as a tool
o religious speakers
you frightened the world so much from the hell fire
it surprises us when it is said that this cannot be the activity of a muslim
we are ignorant of our own history or intentionally avoid it
were yazids army attack on medina and the incident of karbala the acts of hindus and jews
without accepting facts neither motives can be eliminated nor remedies made
those running bbc should stop dual policy
more super hit topic than this was throwing shoes on bush right or wrong
should have been
tahir chaudhry japan
my friend feel a little bit of shame a person was taken out from the grave and hanged with a pole merely because he raised his voice against aggression and you are interested more in box office topic
the success of operation sherdil and on the other side of the border the victory of operation lion heart depends on whom the general public opinion supports
this is the work of american and pakistani intelligence agencies and pir sahib has fallen prey to this conspiracy
on this forum now all commentaries will be antitaliban because intelligence agencies persons have successfully entered in the taliban ranks and they are taking such measures that can alter general public opinion
i would just like to ask that when for a full one day this dead body remained hanging then what the army people were doing there are they sitting there only to target the general population they give statements like this bombing on taliban hideouts shelling on house kills 2 children and their mother
were they not aware of this crossing
or they were watching a game
we request you to please close this game for the sake of god
after all there is a ruler above you as well
even if the question asked by the bbc is rational or irrational we feel sorry to observe the superficial knowledge of writers for example no one asked the question that what was the objective before thirty thousand soldiers went to sawat
those who help the army and fight the taliban their dead bodies keep hanging with street poles the whole day
whatever treatment the people of sawat received from the army was not respectable but the media including the bbc has done no good by keeping the real fact away from the world
the pakistan army is playing a game
everyone in sawat says that this is a bloody drama
please stop it for gods sake
these taliban have tarnished muslims name
if in the whole world true muslims do not consider them muslim then why they allow terrorists to live in their areas
those who are unconcerned about their self respect and cannot do hard work they take a gun and join their group
feel ashamed
it has no justification neither in any religion nor in any family tradition
the whole media including bbc broadcasts commentaries on the subject of the taliban and tribes through different sources
but no one knows what is the real situation we are the only people who have knowledge of this because we are tribal
in brief this is a game in which the cia raw mossad and our own isi are participating there is no taliban or tribe these troublemakers have been created by these institutions and they are tarnishing islam taliban islamic religious schools the pushtoon nation tribes and tribal traditions
as a result of this deed the heads of all muslims have bowed down with shame
i solute mqm leader altaf hussain and the leadership of anp and ppp who raise voice against this cancer ie taliban
this cancer is the creation of ziaulhaq who himself died but with that also destroyed pakistan
but i am hopeful that the present leadership will be able to put an end to this cancer
after the mumbai attacks india has alleged that these strikes were backed by some extremist elements in pakistan
pakistan refuted these allegations and said it will extend all help to india in investigation
india said that it has given a list of the names of 20 suspected extremists to pakistan who are wanted by india
now pakistan has said that the head of jaishemuhammad maulana masood azhar included in this list is not under house arrest and the government of pakistan does not know the whereabouts of this person
earlier the president of pakistan asif ali zardari refuted the impression that western intelligence agencies and the indian government have provided pakistan with evidence with respect to the mumbai attacks
referring to ajmal qasab president zardari said it has not yet been proven whether he is a pakistani national
meanwhile prime minister manmohan singh warned pakistan that indian relations with pakistan cannot improve as long as their land is being used for terrorism purposes
and in the latest development the indian cricket team has cancelled its tour of pakistan
should these political incidents influence games
what kind of relationships do you foresee between india and pakistan
neither america nor india will break pakistan
pakistanis themselves will break pakistan
what do you expect after looking at the extent of provincialism sectarianism and fundamentalism
time has also proven that jinnah did not do good to the muslims of india
yasmin chicago
madam if work on jinnahs vision remained continued then neither the cancer of provincialism sectarianism and fundamentalism would have spread in pakistan nor were the muslims in india treated in this way
but the mistake is ours because we could not produce a leader of his standing
if we cannot value our heroes then
capabilities exist in abundance in this piece of land
god knows when they will understand and with the blessing of unity this land will progress
in both the countries antipeace elements mullah pundit taliban shiv sena rss etc have been developed
invisible forces do not want this piece of land to progress with peace and that is why they are made to face great trouble
can you imagine if pakistan india and china stand united in this region then what will be their status in the world
gods wrath has fallen on pakistan that is why the nation is being forcibly ruled by thieves dacoits and plunderers
may god keep our country pakistan under protection all the time god please accept our prayer
but sahib if you look at the circumstances and ground realities around you with open eyes you will see how far the american armed forces have reached
apart from this the affairs of the state are not looking better either the state of affairs in nwfp balochistan and karachi in sindh are open to you
in these circumstances the country needs a leader who can make us united as one nation
oh god bless us with your kindness
in my view a last war is the need of the hour
it is too much
the matter should be decided now
this issue cannot be resolved with hypocrisy dialogue tricks
and neither by launching minor terrorist acts in each others countries
even europe too got satisfied only after fighting final the final world war
if the world war has not been fought like india and pakistan they too would have still been involved in hue and cry
almost all our political parties have a consensus that terrorism and sectarianism should be eradicated from the country
but our army leadership does not look honest in this because on one hand they assure america and europe that we are with you in the fight against terrorism whereas on the other hand they also secretly support the taliban
we have to think now and determine our direction and have to choose only one path thanks
there is no doubt that a great majority in jamaatuddawa consists of those who were formerly members of lashkaretaiba and after its banning they entered the other organization created with the name of jamaatuddawa pakistan
however after this its members preferred doing relief work and now upon indias continued pressure the united nations has banned it too and the government of pakistan is also continuing a crackdown against this organization
in my opinion all these fighter groups instead of pursuing religious extremism if carry on religious and relief activities that would be far better
the terrorist organizations active in pakistan who patronize criminals in the name of jihad they and the leaders of these mullas have been giving pakistan the name of paledistan and many more names
now they are leaving no stone unturned to destroy pakistan
in fact not to talk of muslims they cannot even be called humans
without cleaning out these wicked people from pakistan the safety of the country will be in danger
do we still need to think whether a ban should be imposed on these seditious people or not
there is no place for violent mullas in this world whose only role is killing
this news is breaking the heart into pieces
what type of world is this where a person who only mentions the name of an important member of islamic religion gets into trouble
nonmuslims can kill muslims but if a muslim just tries to even the score then the nonmuslim world together with our insincere leaders badly treat those truthful sincere and faithful people who have pain in their hearts for divine religion and today they are giving the same treatment to our great leader hafiz saeed
as a result of the mumbai attacks
indiapakistan contacts have become tense and the improvement of relations between the two countries in recent years has been badly shaken
india is continuously holding the active and nonactive fighters groups in pakistan responsible
and bringing relationships back to normalcy is being linked with action against these groups
whereas the indian security agencies have held lashkaretaiba directly responsible for the mumbai attacks
in this context the name of jamaatuddawa has also come up again and again
this is not the first time that a terrorist activity in india turned the relationships between two countries tense
as a result of the attack on indian parliament in december 2001 these two neighboring countries moved close to the brink of war
after this in 2002 lashkaretaiba was banned and included in the list of terrorist groups
now a ban on jamaatuddawa is being demanded which the security analysts say is the new face of lashkaretaiba
in your opinion do you think this group should be banned or not
should pakistan take a decisive action against extremist groups active on its soil
is putting a ban on jamaatuddawa
can avoid the present indiapak crisis and how much more important is the ban on armed groups for establishing perpetual peace between the two countries
the security council of the united nations has banned jamaat aldawa but what are the proofs on the basis of which the security council demonstrated such a hurry
does the security council not always show so much haste against muslims only
this is called witness is more efficient than petitioner
if we see india has itself become a failed state
whose intelligence army and other security institutions have failed because a few terrorists gave them a tough time for 72 hours and india by putting the blame of its failures on pakistan is deceiving the whole world
if one nonbeliever is killed there is hue and cry in the whole world why is this double standard
the beloved countrys only nonpolitical religious and welfare organization
furqan farooq faisalabad
as long as our holy prophet (saws) saints and suffis gave love and respect to all people the religion of islam continued to expand and progress with peace and harmony
the muslims too made progress in all fields
but when this beautiful faith landed in the hands of mullahaism the differences in the human race in the form of believer and nonbeliever started to emerge opening new doors of disorder and anarchy of which the world was unaware before
salam do it with a happy mode but do this work on your own
dont do it under pressure from america
if india feels uncomfortable it should provide proof
why doesnt it give
and why does it blame us for everything
there are extremist groups and organizations in india too then why do they not impose a ban on them
are we the only terrorists in the whole world
what should we call it that india is doing in kashmir
what should we call it that israel is doing
the truth is that we are the first islamic nuclear state and the issue is why we are
pakistan is now standing on its last leg
kamranhassan abu dhabi
your comments touch our hearts and the circumstances are not different
now pakistans new map is being boldly published in american journals and the process of bans is a continuation towards the same path
the americans are now tightening their grip on pakistan not slowly but very quickly
in this situation if we as a nation do not demonstrate unity and harmony then keep in mind that if bangladesh can be created then much else can happen
to whatever extent the terrorist attacks are condemned is not enough whether these are attacks in mumbai the islamabad marriot hotel or in palestine
in a similar way the terrorists should be eliminated regardless of whatever region they belong to whether they are pakistanis indians americans or israelis
now the question arises of terrorist attacks in pakistan that take place each day in which hundreds of people are killed but why does the whole world including pakistani authorities keep silent
was the strike on the marriot not a terrorist attack
then why
we are ready to sacrifice ourselves for adviser on interior affairs mr rahman malik who with the grace of god has become so much braver and courageous
in addition to this according to bbc mr malik has also rejected this impression with full force that the arrests of terrorist groups are being carried out on the advice of someone
brother god is great
whether possess the capability or not and saying do not need
whose fight are we pakistanis fighting
and we have our own interests which we will protect with full effort
no one has the right to interfere in others country affairs
colonial regime is apparently not seen
if the people become hopeful of getting justice or the allies emphasize the functioning of an independent judiciary respect the democratic institutions and extend no help to a dictator or soldier then there will be peace in the third world including pakistan but this is perhaps unacceptable to the allies
pakistan is always for no reason busy in pursuit of submission to the european and american objectives
despite the opposition of a dominant population size this has to be practiced
and this thing further raises anti emotions
if america and its allies believe in democracy then they should give up the colonial practice and respect the sovereignty of state they should leave this region
pakistan poses this much capability to arm or disarm itself
the security forces in pakistanicontrolled kashmir raided a camp allegedly linked with the banned lashkaretaiba
after the mumbai attacks pressure is mounting on pakistan to expedite action against terrorist outfits
india alleges that lashkaretaiba is involved in the mumbai attacks
she says that there is no doubt that the terrorists who attacked mumbai used pakistani soil
meanwhile authorities in peshawar said that unknown armed men burned down another depot of trucks providing supply to allied forces in afghanistan and this resulted in the destruction of more than 50 trucks
in peshawar within the last 48 hours this is the second attack on the nato and american supply line
meanwhile pakistan raided a camp of the banned lashkaretaiba before this attempts have been made to disarm the armed groups from karachi to tribal areas they were assured of payment and no action in return for ammunition
the question is does pakistan want to do this
does pakistan have the capability to do this
what do you say

(please note that due to the increased number of commentaries only the comments typed in urdu will be published
for this press altshift on the onscreen keyboard to select urdu)
i have only one question from all the flag holders of humanity
if you kill their children and in turn expect them to come to you with open arms is impossible
and my question is does all wisdom ranging from islamic to eastern and western any logic rational and philosophy gives permission to kill innocent public including those who pray laborers and poor employees only to get the revenge of american strikes
if the answer is no then there is a strong need to get your point of view rectified
the people were given arms because of the concern that russia after afghanistan would move towards pakistan and therefore these people were given arms
now when there is a concern that america will attack pakistan through afghanistan and this has been openly indicated by the existing american president in his presidential election campaign then why should we disarm these people
only for the reason that after overpowering the pakistan army america or india do not have to face public resistance of any type
yes if any one among them is found involved in terrorist activities only pakistan should take action against him
but sorry to say that the governments action against lashkaretaiba made the indian point of view correct that pakistan is involved in this
najeeburrehman sieko lahore pkitn
if it is accepted that lashkaretaiba in involved then implicating the pakistan government is also incorrect
another question is whether these terrorists were supported by any governmental or nongovernmental employee of india
and whether terrorists are only born or created in pakistan and not created in india and other countries of the world
as far lashkaretaiba is concerned recent terrorist activities have no linkages with them
the thing that must be kept in mind is that hafiz saeed was the first jihadi leader who termed the activities of the taliban a sedition
i have a strong belief that taliban activities are an integral part of the american planning and any person or group who challenges the taliban on any pretext it becomes essential for them to clear him from their way
to bring this mission launched with the american and saudi funding to an end a request should be made to both of them saying that in the name of god please clean up this filth that has poisoned our society
also record a protest with them saying that on what moral grounds the american and saudis together spread dangerous arms and socalled jihadis but in reality the virus of contemptuous literature and culture as a result of which human slaughter houses were opened up in our country
after the danger of indian attack the pakistan armys announcement that they will withdraw their forces from the afghan border to pay attention to india and subsequently the talibans announcement that they will take care of afghan borders disturbed the americans who did their utmost to avoid an indian attack on pakistan
this fully exposed the secret of american strength in this region
though india neither issued the threat for attack nor it has the courage to do this
the rest of the task was fulfilled by the talibans attack on the american supply line
it has been proven that without the support of the pak army and government america is nothing
karachi being pakistans financial and commercial hub is a dubai for all underdeveloped areas
hundreds of thousands of people never return emptyhanded from this city but the absence of rules of law in western border areas karachi has invited the attention of all
now they are bent upon the abduction of this city
for the first time pathans are being regarded as pukhtoons due to which the residents of the same city are made to fight as strangers whereas the need is for unity
one solution to the problem is that either those who speak urdu should learn pushto or those who speak pushto should learn urdu or much better if all learn english
you will certainly treat it as a ridiculous proposal but dont you feel the reason for conflict as being silly
that language is the cause of violence
zaheer chughtai
sir in my childhood i presented this proposal many times to my friends consisting of people from all religious and linguistic groups but they used to laugh at these proposals
at that time these linguistics and religious hatred was not as powerful and strong as this is today but was internally gathering strength
do not understand what and why is happening
are these signs of the day of judgment
for what offense are the innocent and blameless being killed
reasons are in front of us all the same people who want to turn pakistan into pieces are active and they dont have any country or religion
whether it is karachi or mumbai both have been burned by their own people
whichever government comes into power they start earning their name by changing the names of places for example these days airport road building are all benazir
does the treatment being meted out to the people of karachi and pakistan be called benazir
when the mumbai attacks were at their peak the failure of an attempt to start linguistic disturbances in karachi proves that those who were at the payroll of raw in the past have now resigned
the sleeping pakistanism has been awakened from karachi to khyber by the killings of innocent pushtoon laborers and the indian threats
a strong uniform patriotic reaction from all political religious linguistic and national parities has not only taught india the diplomatic norms it has also provided americans with another opportunity to think about
mutahiddah and anp are responsible for the bad situation in karachi whereas the administration is partially
the administration can control the situation within one hour but they are intentionally backing it
it avoids taking action due to pressure on the police and the rangers from the political parties
the talks about unity are limited only to giving statements political parties should leave their own interests and work for the wellbeing of the common man
as long as the political pressure on the administration continues similar incidents will happen may allah keep pakistan under his protection
in my opinion these are the biggest terrorists
and essentially some foreign powers are involved in this but we dont know who is that
but sorry to say that if there has been a similar situation in any of the cities in frontier the government would have treated it roughly since it is not in frontier the government looks helpless
the government must initiate an operation here to save the largest and important city of the country from terrorism
otherwise pakistan will have to face a big financial crisis
even bbc urdu is not writing the truth due to fear whereas the condition of pakistani media is considerably thin
the whole truth is available on bbc english
one solution to the problem is that those who speak urdu learn pushto or those who speak pushto learn urdu or much better if all learn english
you will certainly term this suggestion a funny one but dont you consider the reason for conflict a funny one
that the cause of violence be language
at last another story of brutality was recorded in karachi the fear of which was long been felt by every citizen
everyone did his best and spared no effort the facts reported on media are only 50 of what actually happened here during the four days
spent the last three nights sleepless and still there is a fear
all those who get hotels evacuated kill cobblers and peanut sellers
commit highway robberies and cut the ears of innocents are all unaware of allahs wrath which will grip them some day
what in your opinion are the causes of this sudden unrest
(bbc)
keeping before us the heartshaking carnage in mumbai we dont have to dive deep at all to find out the cause of unrest in karachi but the simple and easy reason is that the unrest is caused unconsciously as a result of bloods uncontrolled motion
it is very clear that if someone teases the father then it will not be surprising if his son gets out of control
the blood of liaquat ali khan and many other faithful belonged to the same place to remove the misunderstanding of mr sieko i am writing this stanza
we too will repeat the tradition of forefathers
we gave life for its creation and will give life to save it
faizan tauseef siddiqui
it is a matter of great sorrow that the whole country is now at risk but we are fighting with each other
mr siddiqui my submission is that if we
look in wikipediaorg we will find that liaquat ali khan belonged to a respectable punjabi family of the karnal area of punjab province
due to his hard work for refugees they call him their own man
every action is bound to have a reaction
can bear it with for ones own person
ejaz awan
sir before you too gather a huge crowd of proposers within a night i must tell you that the open signs of real wickedness are these days seen on the walls of karachi in the shape of wall writings and posters
we have been experiencing both types of wickedness
the wicked people have not spared pakistan and the founder of pakistan they did not have to face any reaction
they are still plundering the same pakistan
only muslim league n was left but it too drafted and handed over the eighteenth amendment bill to the peoples party
before this mqm and muslim league q have submitted their draft eighteenth amendment bills to the national assembly and the senate
so far it seems that drafts for the eighteenth amendment are political tricks and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved
this is because of the same reason that no one has so far made any hue and cry in favor of this amendment on the floor of the assembly or the senate and forced the houses to approve this amendment
it appears that after submitting the draft eighteenth amendment these parties have created a proof of their effort which means they are now able to tell the people tomorrow that they had submitted the amendment but the speaker of the government party did not process it
mqm is a coalition partner of the government muslim league n is a hidden ally of the government whereas muslim league q is a party responsible for passing the seventeenth amendment how then can it be possible for these parties to be sincere in doing away with the seventeenth amendment
this is clearly an excuse to claim a big reward for a marginal effort
anyway the peoples party is not in a hurry to eliminate the seventeenth amendment
how can one think of cutting his own hands
as long as zardari is president the seventeenth amendment is unlikely to be done away with
this was the majority opinion in one of our surveys and this is true as well
zardari would not have become the president if there had been any intention to do away with the seventeenth amendment
now he is even stronger than president pervez because in addition to being president he is also the peoples party chairperson
the seventeenth amendment will stay as long as he is the president
before eliminating the seventeenth amendment the political parties will have to make president zardari say goodbye to the president house
neither mqm nor other parties want this
the majority of the elders in my family belonged to the labor class
and when we used to see our paternal and maternal uncles doing the job of a daily laborer a wish in our heart always prompted us to request allah to keep us away from the work involving physical labor
to be saved from this i wrote a letter to the editor of daily imroz asking him what to do after matric so as to avoid physical labor
the editor in his reply advised to become a doctor or engineer and suggested the reading of specific subjects
from the beginning i was interested in engineering that is why i studied technical drawing instead of biology
but at the time of admission in fsc my elder brother forced me to become a doctor by doing fsc in premedical
i barely studied biology for a month but being unable to understand it opted to take up mathematics
this means that the fear of physical labor helped me to become an engineer and now among the family members of the same age group i am in a comparatively better position for which i am always thankful to god
this story came to my mind at a time when i along with my two young sons was trying to take away the carpets of our old house
i said if it is true then work as hard with your study as i did and then you will get rid of physical labor
my son replied that i am studying and will complete it too but i cannot do this work
all three of us finished this job by hook or by crook in three hours and returned home
the purpose of telling this story is that if a person has selected his destination with whatever background reasons no one can stop him from reaching his destination
well if you dont know what to do then it will be very hard to succeed
it is said that those who have died should not be blamed but what should be done when we only see faults in benazir even at her first death anniversary
just to safeguard her own interests benazir provided the list of sikh freedom fighters to india and thus on one hand crushed the independence movement of sikhs and on the other hand allowed india an opportunity to pay full attention to kashmir after having suppressed the movement in punjab
the power tussle between benazir and nawaz sharif is a part of history that pushed the country several years back
during the period of her exile benazir continued to issue negative statements about kashmir and the atomic program
violating the agreement signed with nawaz sharif in london benazir entered into a deal with general musharraf
while in power benazir provided her husband with an opportunity to earn money in whatever ways he could and this is why he was named as mr ten percent
while benazir was in power her brother was murdered but his killers are still safe from punishment
despite being a woman benazir avoided fighting for the rights of women
just as benazir did politics on the dead body of her father in a similar style her widowed husband is doing politics on her dead body
benazir came into power twice but not to talk of giving punishment to those involved in the political murder of her father she even failed to get a case registered against them
thirtyseven years have passed since the separation of east pakistan from us and look at the extreme of apathy that our public and rulers have demonstrated by neither mourning nor showing any regrets for their mistakes on this day
we should have celebrated 16 december as a day of admonition and taken measures to prevent the reoccurrence of similar happenings
we should have sent the messages of goodwill on this day to the people of bangladesh and tried to bring them closer to us again
rulers should have opened the file of the hamoodurrahman commission and pondered upon the reasons for separation of east pakistan
we should have taken measures to bring back the stranded biharis in bangladesh and sent them gifts for encouragement
but we have turned so senseless that if someone dies in our neighborhood we have no information about this
we dont have any concerns for our sisters and brothers because we have become selfish
even after the occurrence of the greatest of tragedies we get deeply occupied the next day with the usual affairs of life
would that as east and west germany became united again in a similar style east and west pakistan too had become united again
we can become united again if we sacrifice for each other and get out of the shell of selfishness
but this desire is not likely to be fulfilled in the near future
news came in todays broadcast saying that the governor of the state of illinois in the united states has been arrested for corruption charges
to remove him from the governorship the provincial congress has moved very quickly with the preparation for his accountability an american white man who keeps a careful eye on pakistans affairs boastfully challenged me by citing this example of democracy
in america even the powerful are not above the law
and in your country pakistan even the president came into power after getting corruption charges dropped against himself
i responded in a joking way saying that the arrest of a governor in america is totally worthless if compared with pakistan where one prime minister was arrested and hanged and another was exiled in no time
tell me if this has even happened in america
in pakistan the one who broke the constitution was offered a guard of honor before his departure from the presidential palace tell me if this has ever happened in america
in pakistan the chief justice was suspended and despite public support he has not been reinstated up to now has this happened in america
in pakistan a fake degree holder was made the minister for health has this happened in america
after listening to this the poor american laughed too much and accepted his defeat
despite being surrounded by the americans from all four sides president zardari is still smiling in this picture
his smile is an indication
of his feeling that america is backing his government but he is forgetting that a year ago the same people were supporting pervez musharraf
the picture has been portrayed as if it is a family picture
this type of picture showing three american delegates with a president has not been published in the newspapers before
it seems the american responsibility has increased in pakistan and now it needs more than one employee to carry it out or the level of their trust on the new slave is not as high as was for the previous one
it may also be possible that keeping in view president zardaris reputation of backtracking they had to make this arrangement
if there has been a sensible leader he would at least have avoided putting his teeth on show and his face would obviously have exhibited the shame of slavery
if the principle of democracy is applied to this picture then president zardari is in the minority
in accordance with democracy only the majority has a government in the country and who is that this picture is telling
the paradise like sawat is also called pakistans switzerland
so far as per governmental strategy negotiations are continuing along with the use of force
but the use of force is not giving any paybacks except helping to increase the talibans strength and creating sympathies for them among the public
what is needed is that instead of using force the government should eliminate the causes of this problem
by eliminating the causes fazlullah and the taliban will be eliminated automatically
the shariah bill proposed by the anp government will solve sawat problems to a greater extent
but along with the enforcement of shariah the government shall also side by side have to pay attention to the economic issues
it appeared on the basis of initial steps taken by musharraf that perhaps this nation will be liberated from incapable politicians but the lust for power changed all his intentions
and the measures that were expected from him disappeared
as the government of bush started coming to an end musharraf started feeling concerned about the end of his rule and in a state of perturbation he entered into a deal with thieves
general musharraf could control the army but the current government does not know what is going on
in the troubled area of sawat in the frontier province even with the continuing military operations for the last one year the situation is increasingly becoming worse
on one hand writ of the government in this area is now limited only to passing a condemnation resolution in the national assembly whereas on the other hand the influence of the talibans illegal fm radio channel is significantly increasing in sawat
thirdly a common man deems it safe to be showing submissiveness to those who are practically in control of this area
in sawat killing of extremists is claimed as a result of shelling from gunship helicopters and artillery fires during security forces operations but even with these killings the taliban have not only gathered more strength but according to an estimate they are in control of 80 of the sawat area
the result is that on one hand the government is not ready to accept its failures and on the other hand the taliban are strong
who is being crushed in between the poor citizens
in sawat someone asked how are the taliban the reply came that they are very good because they are the custodians of allahs code of life and are fighting against enemies of allah and the religion of allah
another question was asked how is army the answer received said very well because it is defending the country and fighting against the enemies of the country
then it was asked who is the enemy of allahs code of life and the country the reply was we the public
i am surprised how the pakistan army will fight with the indian army when it cannot control a small group of taliban
they could not track an illegallyrun fm channel of taliban which i think is very simple
but still it is spreading poisonous propaganda with full might
after girls schools boys schools are now being destroyed
curfew is imposed so as to facilitate the movement of taliban
last night during curfew hours they penetrated the suburbs of mangora and made hideouts
the question arises as to how they reached there during curfew hours
the army can kill akbar bugti in his house and salutes talibans
for gods sake someone make this army understand to help free the defenseless people of sawat out of the grips of the taliban and prove that the pakistan army can overpower any kind of enemy
the respectable gentleman says that in the world most of the bloodshed was caused by religion you tell me if there had been no religion at all had this bloodshed not happened
are punjabi pathan white black mehsud and other tribes the products of religion
no not at all sir only religion teaches us that there is no white no black no punjabi and no refugee if there had been no religion then half of the world would have been destroyed in the war between white and black and the rest would have fallen prey to enmity on the basis of cost and race
in fact religion provides moral training to human beings and makes them disciplined on the grounds that they have not been born with their own free will but the creator of the universe has sent them here and they have to live in this world in accordance with gods commands
as a muslim i have a firm belief that islam is a complete code of life and a true religion
after having settled in london for several years i used to call each relative daily in the morning to get to know their health but despite this the majority of them did not even call on a single occasion to inquire about us then i realized that they werent even welcoming our telephone call and i stopped calling them
while living in france during the last two years i got the same feeling
i dont know why people expect only from us to call them
the resolution against iraq was passed in just a few hours and dispatching a peace force to darfur is not a problem at all
immediately condemning the mumbai attacks and banning suspected organizations is an exercise of a few hours
and about the place where death is dancing we are in the process of consultations
o the custodians of world peace the life is disappearing here
does the end of this is not being awaited in reality
so that any depressed cannot even think of using an extensively destructive weapon like the slingshot to get his right
when a father is seen running with the dead body of his beloved child then too dont you feel the waves of pain in any part of your heart

but in fact you are a symbol of shame for humanity
it has been proven that for thousands of years this region has also been the country of the israelis
what these two nations should do is live together with love and fondness but since the strings of their control are in the hands of western and arabic countries that is why peace can never be established here without their will
in fact now iran also wants to fight its proxy war from this region
if israeli attacks cease for the time being then it will recommence following some other another incident
the bbcs countrys interests are linked with its services to america and israel and this is the reason that in the grab of enlightenment they have emerged with a series of blogs to project judaism and carrying out onesided and blind propaganda
the bbc is merely completing formalities whereas its real intention and objective is only to gather sympathies
i request the moderator to publish my comments so that we can get some idea about the remaining magnitude of the bbcs factloving aspect

dont know who wrote this story or how it came into being but one thing is clear that in every age draculas have been sucking the blood of innocent human beings
wars have been taking place in every age and blood has been flowing during all these times
but it is a matter of surprise as to why the human being of the 21st century who regards himself as very civilized is silent upon the open massacres being committed in broad daylight
why are they not feeling this that whatever is happening today is presenting the worst form of humanity

all our leaders are the category of people who run away with their briefcases they have no concern if the country exists or not
they have no concern whether the public sells toothpowder or cleans the bells of temples with lemon peels
like our rulers our media is also corrupt
its only and only objective is to extract money from the government and nothing else
as far as the public is concerned they are ignorant and talking about the public is even the biggest ignorance
there occurred a surprising event yesterday afternoon
the whole police are running here and there and not taking action on illegal parking
moreover nypd traffic was not in the mood to check illegal parking either
it so happened that an aircraft of the us air became a plane in reality and landed in the hudson river
the only information so far known is that the terrorists belonged to the species of goose
yesterday was perhaps the historic cold in new york
the temperature never falls to this level
my own jaw has started giving pain due to half an hours walk outdoors
just imagine what would have happened to people who jumped out of the plane into the river
the happy news is that all of them remained saved
and the painful news is that in the time of this financial crisis the companys plane sunk

we have been considering the sawati taliban group as uncivilized who were fed up with only female education
they were demonstrating this unhappiness at one place or the other by demolishing schools or colleges for women
but like many assumptions this too has not been proven true according to cnn on the holy day of monday the taliban blasted a boys school
sawat taliban demolish a boys school
the girls schools were actually demolished first following a famous english proverb saying ladies first we dont know why people are still bent upon calling the taliban uncivilized uncultured and barbarous
another allegation against the taliban that also becomes clear from this is that the taliban are not only against the education of girls is not correct
but they are totally against education by the grace of god
may allah give these fighters more strength and
help them uproot the cruel government imposed upon us
this refreshed a girls marriage with a dog some time back
look at that bridegroom too
there is a dearth of humanity in the twentyfirst century as well
this is the age of the computer and its intervention is getting higher in every walk of life
many people have reservations about this growing intervention of the computer eg in financial affairs
where the use of credit card facilitates you it also becomes a source of improving the grip of law enforcement agencies upon your private life
that now your whereabouts can be traced just through financial dealings for example the use of credit card
in the future when the use of real currency will get minimized to a greater extent its usefulness will increase
in the same way in the criminal world too instead of taking the risk of bank burglary the credit card information is stolen
in the same way building friendship is also being done through computer resources
social networking web sites eg orkut facebook and myspace are rated first in terms of popularity
but dont you feel that as we get more and more under the influence of these social networks mentally in the same way we are practically getting more and more isolated from people
in a similar manner there are matchmaking web sites in which your likes are matched with other peoples likes and a list of compatible people is shown to you
can you live your life with another person exactly similar to you
i cannot live that is why a life partner is also called a better half
this means that the flaws that exist in my personality my spouse covers them
perhaps i got a lesser portion of acumen
in my childhood i used to accept as being true whatever a person of old age had said
in the same way i had full confidence that dad knew the answer to every question in the world
because of this i was ridiculed
but only those things that were possible appeared true to me
i used to feel great hesitation upon the need of telling lies
in that age too i was at a loss due to this
as such i try to tell minimum lies
dont enter into a false promise with anyone by citing the name of allah
and i mention insha allah only when i am praying for something to get done
rest allah knows better what is in our hearts
this is a disgusting issue that came into existence as a result of being away from religion
in accordance with both our religion and the laws of pakistan innocent children should live with their mothers
their maintenance is the responsibility of the father who can meet with them
when children become adults it is up to them to decide with whom they want to live
you have rightly said that kith and kin are the real problems who teach inappropriate lessons
feudal thinking is heavily influencing our all actions
the thought working behind it is that new successors to share the property of father will be produced and this development is opposed otherwise the action of their father is appreciable and should be practiced
in our society restrictions with reference to relationships have created social evils
the concept of marriage of widows and divorced is disappearing day by day
these useless values and inappropriate traditions are putting the family system in disarray
in our society if the wife or husband of a 5055 yearold dies and heshe enters into a second marriage then why is this not viewed to be a good practice
in our neighborhood a pakistani uncle lives whose wife died ten twelve years ago after getting all his children married he then himself married a widow as a result of which all his children turned against him
in my view this is his religious right what do you say
we cannot bear that someone takes the place of our mother while we are alive what type of approach is this
in my opinion the children of this gentleman should think that after getting all the kids married if he enters into a marriage with a widowed woman then what harm has he done
in this way the widowed woman got support and the uncle found a housekeeper
because his children would certainly have become busy with their respective individual lives and were not giving time to him
ignorance is the reason for this
this is the result of pressure from society
when people make a joke of the family for such an act then the children start feeling embaressad at the fathers second marriage
though they should fight with the circumstances saying that the action of their father was wholly in accordance with islam
this is a curse in our society of which we have completely become a victim during the past 4050 years
it is even acceptable to a wife that her husband may continue with the immoral activities but she does not allow him to have another marriage
if this were within her control she would not have allowed her husband to marry even after her death
in addition to spoiling hers and her husbands afterlife she is also becoming the cause of spreading corruption in society
repeating the name of islam brings nothing factually we like only those things that are in accordance with our customs and traditions
for example wani kari keeping the girls illiterate and gun bullet for the marriage of own choice
as far your question is concerned instead of bringing the widow to his home if the gentleman had gone to the widows home the relatives would have become quiet after making some formal hue and cry (but this would have disturbed the stomachs of the widows relatives)
in the indopak subcontinent we accepted islam centuries ago but could not get rid of irrational beliefs till today and gave preference to customs and traditions upon religion
terming a mans second marriage as immoral divorce a sign of shame a divorced woman as an untouchable love marriage as a sign of disrespect and a man marrying a woman of higher age as the cleverness of woman is a result of this way of thinking
as a result of blindly following the culture of western nations we regard purdah and virtuousness as outdated concepts
it was easier to accept islam but it was very difficult to get rid of thoughts like this
may allah give us all the courage and boldness to do this
ameen

today after isha prayer while i was coming back towards the shop a man sitting in a car signaled by raising his hand towards me to get my attention
i thought perhaps this man has forgotten the way or wants to ask something i stopped and saw his whole family sitting in the car
he asked whether i could fully understand arabic i said no problem tell me the issue
he started saying that i came from riyadh to medina and someone picked my pocket and so could you please help me i said for him to excuse me because a similar incident had already happened to me when i gave 20 riyals to a person to buy petrol with this money and get back to riyadh but he after going a little distance started doing the same thing
i felt considerably annoyed scolded him and he then ran away when i gave him a threat of police
now we muslims have reached a position where we are using the car with family for begging purposes and make a minimum of two threethousand on a daily basis
there exists a clear saying of the holy prophet (saws) that the upper hand is better than the lower one because the lower hand is that of a taker and the upper hand is that of a giver
may allah bless us with his kindness and make us true muslims (ameen)

the wife of the famous singer adnan samis wife reached a police station in mumbai and blamed him for violence
the police station has advised her to seek the advice of the court
adnan samis wife saba galadari has lodged a complaint against her husband adnan sami that he consistently commits violence
and inhuman treatment against her
since this has crossed the limit of her tolerance therefore a court case should be registered against adnan sami
instead of registering the case the police advised her to consult the court because this case is outside its jurisdiction
do you think the allegations of adnan samis wife are correct
is this allegation not an indian effort to defame adnan sami
give your opinion about this

as far as allegations are concerned anyone can blame the others

according to the higher american officials president obama will adopt a hardline approach towards afghan president hamid karzai
in the new american policy about afghanistan war has been accorded preference over the development
according to the officials hamid karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achieving american targets in afghanistan because corruption prevails in the government the drugs business has increased and the taliban are gaining strength
according to american officials those from the american administration who are mounting pressure on hamid karzai for increased measures include vice president joe biden and president obamas envoy to afghanistan and pakistan richard holbrooke
according to them this policy has come up after the departure of president bush who used to have a video conference with hamid karzai every two weeks to emphasize the american role in the reconstruction of afghanistan and its civic institutions
the officials said that the obama administration will work with provincial leaders as a substitute for the central government
the officials said they would press hamid karzai to increase the fight against corruption
hamid karzai is facing new elections this year and this is not yet clear whether obama and his companions would support him for the presidency or not
is this statement of american officials a signal of change in american policy towards afghanistan
is hamid karzais rule going to end

the sri lankan cricket team has reached pakistan to play a oneday international series
despite pakindia tensions a foreign cricket teams visit to pakistan is a welcome matter
after reaching karachi airport the sri lankan team was accorded a warm welcome
two oneday matches between pakistan and sri lanka will be played in karachi whereas the third oneday will be held in lahore
high claims about bowling batting and fielding are being advanced from both the teams
if sri lankans are proud of their spinners pakistan trusts its fast bowling
according to the captain of the sri lankan cricket team mahela jayawardene no single player but the whole pakistani team is dangerous
muralitharan and mandis will be the trump cards whereas according to the pakistani captain the competition will be tough

all this has been done by these people kashmiris have been fighting the war of independence for the last 60 years
no one has helped them and now when they have been trapped up in the war of extremism and terrorism reconciliation talks have commenced
first they committed mass murders of muslims and now are on the lookout for a compromise
anyhow pakistan must understand their dual policy
asad khan london
india is trying to create such a situation so as to get the world attention diverted from kashmir
but pakistan has always shown the real face of india to the world
now the british government also understands this thats why india by defaming pakistan in the name of terrorism is trying to ignore the kashmir occupation
and is hesitant to talk to pakistan on this issue
the british foreign minister david miliband has said that terrorism shall be eliminated with the solution of the kashmir issue and the government of pakistan shall be able to deal effectively with the dangers developing on its borders
remember that before this the newlyelected american president barack obama also gave a similar statement about the kashmir issue
the british foreign minister expressed in a discussion with the media in mumbai and in an article he wrote that the idea about the fight against terrorism is wrong it was the policy of president bush to kill people in the name of selfdefense
david miliband has said that pakistan should not demonstrate any leniency towards the terrorist groups
because of the emphasis by the big powers for the need of a solution to the kashmir issue is india not trying to divert attention from the issue by creating tension in the region
is mumbai terrorism not a part of this strategy
does india intend to escape the process of broad negotiations by making the terrorism a basis

in my opinion the big powers dont want to bring complete damage to pakistan
but in order to bring it under control they are thinking of some measures they know that pakistan is a nuclear power
they want to create the situation of a revolution here
the foreign countries are thinking that backing pakistan into a corner may result in some political and geographical difficulties they want to help pakistan sidebyside achieving their own objectives

prime minister yousuf raza gilani has said that the newlyelected american vice president joe biden played an important role in expresident musharraf leaving his army chief post and the reinstatement of a lame democracy and therefore the government of pakistan has awarded him with sitaraeimtiaz

the american president george w bush in his farewell press conference advising the newly elected president barack obama said that he made many mistakes during the period of his presidency and barack obama should do whatever he deems appropriate
as a president i took steps in accordance with the circumstances and in the light of the american constitution and law and preferred the american interests upon my own popularity
he said that even today the enemies of america are planning to attack america the greatest challenge for barack obama will be to stop these attacks
he said that the greatest disappointment for me was that no weapons of mass destruction were found in iraq and the greatest mistake was my declaration about the completion of the mission in iraq
while addressing his last press conference in the white house the american president said that this is his last press conference and he wanted to thank all the journalists and other friends who participated in that conference

and pakistan uses terrorism as a state policy
addressing the chief ministers conference in new delhi manmohan singh said that terrorists are being backed by neighboring countries particularly pakistan

the indian prime minister said that the mumbai attacks in november were carried out by lashkaretaiba
he further said that the terrorists are using new techniques and the latest telecommunication systems they will have to increase security along the control line where cross border activities take place according to him terrorism in any form would not be accepted and this was their policy

this is a highly heartbreaking incident that israelis are committing the mass murder of palestinians here in kashmir the situation is not different but the security council does not pay any heed to it
all the organizations currently present in palestine and kashmir should keep on fighting till their independence and by creating unity among themselves continue to fight all types of aggressions their martyrdom will one day come up with flying colors with the grace of god
israeli air strikes on gaza are continuing and so far hundreds of palestinian men women and children have been martyred
an important political leader of hamas nazarian has been killed along with his wife and children
on the other hand a meeting of the security council has concluded without taking any decision
in the meeting the resolution for condemning israel presented by libya and other arab countries is facing american opposition
the air strikes by israeli plans on the civilian palestinian population have continued for the last several days
the whole world began crying over the mumbai attacks but america and britain have been unable to see the mass bloodshed as a result of the israeli strikes

in my view the real issue is that the majority of our nation is uneducated they dont know where their money is going the government is interested in discharging its responsibilities by imposing taxes the electricity and gas shortage will continue to exist in the same way
because all are aware of the character of those who have been elected by the public
in the whole lengths and breadths of pakistan the shortage of gas and electricity has reached an alarming situation
on the other hand effective from 01 january gas prices have been raised up by 8 percent on average whereas in some cities of the country the nonavailability of petrol has become a cause of intense suffering for the public
in pakistans industrial and commercial sectors intense reaction uproars and violent demonstrations are continuing against the long electricity loadshedding and gas crises
the industrialists have given an ultimatum for the closure of factories
in karachi eight to ten hours of loadshedding is causing restlessness among the people
industrial life has almost come to a standstill
in this connection the government departments are giving their point of view by blaming each other
are the talks to increase gas and electricity prices not a joke with the public
why is attention not being paid towards the solution of problems
does the government not watching the wheel of the countrys progress getting jammed
what sorts of immediate measures would you suggest to overcome this crises

after 8 years of rule over america president bush has left the white house and shifted to the presidential camp office in camp david so that the white house can be prepared after refurbishment in accordance with new president barack obamas desire

the indian government has stopped the indian cricket team from visiting pakistan
the indian cricket team was to play three tests five oneday matches and one twenty20 match in pakistan
the vice president of the indian cricket board said while talking to jeo news that the board had requested permission for pakistan visit from the government but due to the existing stressful situation between the two countries this visit is not possible
is the indian government stand to cancel the cricket teams visit on the basis of current political scenario a correct action and should the game not be treated separately from politics
is the indian governments decision not harmful to cricket
when the england cricket team despite the bad security situation in india continued its visit then why cant the indian team visit pakistan
what is your opinion about this
salman karachi
those who feel proud of visiting india
and make their films or videos over there should now open their eyes to see how much respect the people of india have for them
i remember an interview of adnan sami in which he said that he was not a pakistani and he had british nationality
adnan sami should come to pakistan as soon as possible because there too he was not worthy of respect
farid ahmad
karachi
after the mumbai attack the attitude of indians has changed
jagjit singh has expressed his reaction by saying that he hates pakistan and the pakistanis
it should be known that adnan sami has sung with asha bhosle how can he be a bad singer now adnan sami should live in india there is no need to come here
muhammad shamshad alam
karachi about jagjit singhs statement i shall only say that he changes his color like lizard
and issues statements depending on the situation open your eyes pakistanis to see how much respect there is for you in india try to understand the hindu mindset
after the mumbai attacks their hateful statements have increased and now they are also ejecting poison against adnan sami
after this the journalist took off one of his shoes and threw it at bush before the shoe could have touched president bush very skillfully bowed his head down to save himself
the second shoe hit the american flag
the security personnel dragging the journalist along took him away from the scene
president bush on this occasion said that he didnt know why he did so the shoe was of size 10 he is not worried
in your opinion does this act of the journalist not reflect an angry reaction on behalf of the iraqi nation against president bush
what would you say about this incident
in the aftermath of the terrorist incident in mumbai the tension between india and pakistan became a severe time when fighter aircrafts of the indian air force violated the airspace of pakistan in kashmir and lahore sectors
the response of the pakistan air force forced the indian aircrafts to go back
according to the sources both the indian aircrafts were equipped with weapons and explosives

according to the pakistan air force it is fully prepared to defend the country
according to information minister sherry rehman indian authorities have accepted that violation of the airspace did take place however it was due to a mistake

in your opinion is india really determined to launch an air attack against pakistan
is the indian point of view that this violation was the result of a mistake correct or the purpose of this was to assess the capability of the pak air force
will this incident not be the cause of furthering tensions between the two countries
