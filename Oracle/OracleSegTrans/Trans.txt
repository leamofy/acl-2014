the role of european union for the peace in middle east
from official point of view the role of european union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the middle east
according to the official stand of brussels schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of sarkozy are helping hands in this process
the spokesperson of the european commission amadeu altafaj said that every effort which helps advancing the joint message of the european union to the two parties is welcome
it seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned
but in reality the european union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions
the role of czech republic as the president of the union is already weak
an on top of that the internal issues have made is helpless
on the other hand the french president sarkozy is behaving like if he is still the president of the european union
though france has completed its 6 month presidency period
sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it
the most funny situation is faced by the french foreign minister bernard kouchner
he is in the delegation which is led by schwarzenberg the foreign minister of czech republic
the problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the middle east war
schwarzenberg says that israel has the right to defend itself whereas according to kouchner this war does not come under defense policy on the other side germany has also sent its special ambassador to middle east european union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues
this is the proof of isreal which is doesnt provide any response to the european countries
this is a golden chance for the european union to do something since america due to the policies of george w bush has already failed in the middle east
financial crisis german millionaire industrialists suicide
adolf marclay resident of swabia in south germany has left behind a huge industrialist group
but earlier common german citizens did not know much about him
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the merckle group
marclay group had to bear the loss of hundreds of million euros after it bought the shares of one of known industry folks wigan
then the financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed 100 million and 1 billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on marclay
recently the same banks accepted to provide loan to marclay group on urgent basis but adolf marclay who started as a small industrialist to reach a place where his industrial groups annual income reached 30 billion euros couldnt bear the the loss in his financial strength
after the death of his father when adolf merkel took over his family business he developed it quick putting it on new lines
he called his company ratiopharm which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in germany
some time back the commercial value of this company was in between 5 and 6 billion euro and still was earning a revenue of 81 billion euro annually after the great success of ratiopharm the merkel group acquired many big businesses which included building materials maker hydelberg cement to modifiedspecial car maker kassbohrer company
the number of employees of the merkel group around the world is near 100000 and its foundation company the pharmaceutical ratiopharm always had special importance
adolf marclay has said this many times in his life we have been in pharma business since four generations
now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and i hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years
after the suicide of adolf merkel banks have sanctioned 400 million euros in floating loans for his group but under the condition that vem will have to sell ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term
after the death of adolf marclay the marclay group will not remain the same as it was before

7 percent

voter registration for upcoming presidential election in southern afghanistan started this week
but the commission has told that unless the security situation does not improve voters in few areas of province hilmand will not be able to get registered
the rate of violence has been increased since last year in those southern areas where taliban rebellions have increased their attacks on afghan forces and international forces
meanwhile the afghan and international forces have said that during the night between wednesday and thursday they have killed at least 28 militants during fights across afghanistan
nato said that its armies had killed 22 soldiers in land and air strikes in the western province of khost near the pakistani border
previously the afghan defense ministry had said that the afghan army had killed eight rebels and injured two in the same province
it is not clear whether afghan officials have mentioned the same incident
two missile attacks in waziristan at least 18 killed
pakistan intelligence officials have said that in two doubtful american missile attacks in north waziristan at least 18 people were killed
according to the officials american jet fired three missiles near a house in the area mir ali of north waziristan killing 10 people in that house
according to local officials five of the dead were nonnational soldiers
this area is considered the center of the taliban and alqaidas fighters
a few hours after this incident a missile attack was performed on south waziristan as well in which at least eight people died
despite the objections of the pakistani government since midlast year until now about 30 missile attacks were done in pakistan
the present attacks were the first attacks since president barack obama took office
the bush administration was to accept the disbelief and claime responsibility for the attacks
on friday suspected american spy planes dropped three missiles in the tribal region of north waziristan until now five people have died
the dead could not be identified
according to the initial reports the missile attacked a house in mir ali
it should be known that these are the first missile attacks on the tribal regions of pakistan since barack obama became president
province sarhad government rejected the question of ban on girls education
province sarhad rejected the threat by taliban soldiers in swat by saying that this announcement is against law and islam
on sunday the education minister of sarhad state sardar husain babar added that the government will never allow such efforts to succeed
his saying is that the extremists want that the children in our areas left free from education
in his words these people try to secretly blow up schools and frighten the boys and girls
talking about the environment of fear and insecurity he said that the local government knows well and wants it to be known that no force can stop the spread of education in the land of the pukhtons
one day before maulana fazaullah taliban revolts from 15th january in south put a ban on girls education in institutions and the institutions which go against the warning will be destroyed
despite the military activity going on in swat during the last one and a half years about 150 educational institutions were destroyed by the militants by the use of explosives and arson
due to the destruction of these educational institutions thousands of girls and boys were deprived of the facility of education

reduces the danger of chest cancer in women under 50 years of age by 13rd
the research happening in the moffitt cancer center in the american state of florida has showed that chances of getting tumor of chest cancer in those women under 50 years of age
the research shows that the aged women dont get any effect from drinking three or more cups of tea a day
specialists think that this is because of the presence of such components in tea that are more effective against such types of cancer tumors which usually targets women under 50 years of age
in moffitt cancer center in the city of tampa florida state a research was conducted on over 5000 women who had undergone treatment for breast cancer
experts compared their medical records and lifestyles with women who were safe from breast cancer
the experts also found out that on a particular type of cancer lobular tea had shown a great effect and it reduced by 66 percent
almost every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type of it
this type of cancer is more dangerous because it deep inside and is usually diagnosed when it has already spread to a great extent
experts say that regular tea consumption at least three cups a day can drastically reduce the occurrence of breast cancer in young women
they say that incorporating tea as a regular drink in your daily routine helps create immunity against the cancer
in britain every year approximately 40000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer

american defense minister robert gates has said that the war in afghanistan is the biggest military challenge faced by america
today gates was briefing the senate and the house of representatives of the strategy adopted by the obama administration on the afghan and iraq war

why reduce exercise with the age
new research
exercise is good for health in any age
it makes your heart stronger reduced cholesterol levels helps control weight helps in limiting diabetes and slows the alzheimers process
unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age
experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it
the american medical association says that many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out
dr patricia palecca of mayo clinic minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity
dr patricia teaches medicine at mayo clinic
she headed a research regarding heart diseases and mans ability to do exercise in older age
team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart
in which the pumping of the blood by the heart its contraction and relaxation was studied
the experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood
they came to know that with increase in age problems increase in the relaxation action of heart
dr patricia says that with increase in age the problems in the heart relaxation rates increases and thus effects the ability to exercise with growing age
dr garvin ken was part of this research
he says that we were surprised to see that it has an effect and it confirmed that bad exercising ability is very much related to the heart relaxing activity
some times blood pressure can cause disorders in hearts functions and heart diseases
if doctors and patients can work together when it comes to heart diseases then they can enjoy the benefits of exercise even with older age
a detailed report has been published in the journal of american medical association
no chances of an immediate war with pakistan indian army chief
the chief of the indian army general deepak kapoor has stated that there are no chances of immediate war with pakistan however to serve the country and protect its interests they are always ready
general kapoor blamed that despite of sureties and international pressure in result of mumbai attacks in his words terrorism network is not only present in pakistan but is also active
he said this while talking to the correspondents in srinagar
the indian army chief was on a one day tour to the valley of kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in new delhi administered kashmir and preparation of armed forces on the borders
he was asked as to what his reaction was to the media reports which state that pakistan refuted the proof presented by india about the mumbai attacks
general kapoor said that decisions of war or peace affairs are managed by political leadership
talking about the alleged terrorism network in pakistan he said that indian army will have to face the forces which are objected to destroy peace and weaken india
he said that 700 to 800 militants are present in indian kashmir almost half of them are foreigners
general deepak kapoor said with the betterment of weather attempts of slander may increase from pakistan and her side of kashmir however india has increased vigilance on borders
he refused the chances of reducing the number of deployed army in indian administered kashmir by saying that no compromise on country security
may allah bless the tongues of the world and may barack become a blessing for the world
well there is no hope but see what pakistanamerica relationship brings to us in the result of this change
and what barack obama who is the result of martin luther kings dreams gives to the world
obama part of whose name is husain taking the oath today as the american president is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance but also a historic test
not only for himself but also for all the people who supported him
it will even be a test for the white majority as for them to accept from their hearts a black governing over them is no easy task
those here in south asia especially the muslims who have hopes about him should remember that he was elected the president of america and obama should remember that the president of america is actually the president of the world
after a moment a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to america from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th president of this very america
many people have many expectations from this man
obamas fans should not expect something unrealistic from him
if obama becomes successful in decreasing the religious and racial acrimony it will be a victory for his fans
what effect will this change have on south asia and what considerable change can be expected in the american policy in this regards
how will these changes affect pakistaniamerican relations
my sir whether it be obama or someone else the type of policies with regards to the whole world is decided by the multibillionaire influential strong jewish lobby
and as far as pakistan is concerned after the series of recent bombay blaststhe offensive reaction of india america and israel is in front of everyone
after the creation of pakistan the administration of swat remained with the ruler of swat who had a regular army and law
he handed over administration of swat to pakistan under a pact
but its sad that our governments have treated swat like a step mother
there was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government of the ruler of swat
and no interest was taken in the building and development works
the number of girls receiving education in the present rule is many times less than their number in the previous rule
the taliban are continuing their attacks on educational institutions in the nwfp
the maximum number of schools have been destroyed in district swat in which majority are the girls schools
and not just that the taliban have also announced a ban on education for girls
thousands of boy and girl students are being deprived of education
what do you think the taliban have to gain by eradicating female education
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities so far
in your opinion what government should do
the question should be what does the isi and pakistani agencies get
because the people of swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the taliban and not to kill them otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that during the curfew how come people can be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing
when the government is not being allowed to have any say in swat how can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps
now the question is when government has every thing like armed force latest weapons latest technology and spy system then why these taliban cant be controlled
the only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught
the essence is that these taliban are paving the path for international imperialism by their bad deeds
15 years ago the war was on in afghanistan
the isi was controlling the taliban while on the opposing side was the northern coalition that was being aided by russia india and iran
then suddenly the situation changed and talibans works came to light
and isi was also offered dollars from america so past friends became enemies
now the scenario is that the war is still raging but the supporters in pakistan are still the same iran india and russia
until man realizes what is wrong and what is right he continues to make mistakes
for instance when a thief goes to steal something if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong it is a curse and it will bring punishment and he fears allah that person will not steal
similarly as long as israel does not realize that it is doing wrong and spilling the blood of the innocent and it will receive punishment for that it will continue to play holi with the blood of the innocent people in gaza
greetings
the question is that is war armed resistance and terrorism the solution to problems
if not then what is the specific prescription which takes to the solution of the problems
this is true that war and extremism do not solve problems but rather it puts blessings in them
palestine afghanistan and iraq should adopt the same model for their development that nelson mandela had used in south africa
that means political and inner struggle are more important than armed struggle
kashmiris participation in election shows that they have accepted this point
the israeli attacks on gaza still continue in the third week and the death toll have reached to one thousand
despite worldwide diplomatic efforts to date a ceasefire was not possible
according to another report since the start of attacks on the 27th of december 90000 palestinians have left their homes and moved towards safer locations
here aid groups have accused israel of being careless about palestinian children and said that a whole generation of palestinian children will be victim of grave psychological and emotional difficulties
what do you say
how is permanent peace possible in gaza

taliban should be given a chance
basit peshawar
please wakeup if the taliban start doing the real jihad then who will kill the innocent people
who will burn down girls schools
and if kidnap for ransom or not get ransom so who will hang people on the pole by called them american spy
these taliban have brought such damage to islam that no nation or religion has ever brought
pashtoon roar
kohat pakistan
if the entire muslim world gets together and even just warns israel of attacking it you will see how much israels daddy america will get hurt
and immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well
but what can be done where should our muslim leaders bring the courage from
some one ask ahmadinejad to take the initiative because your bravery is very popular in bbc forum
the responsibility of establishing peace and human rights does not rest with the arabs or the muslims of the world alone but is the obligation of the entire world community to raise their voice against tyranny
this dreadful incident is the worst amongst the crimes committed by bush
just like in pakistan and india at the end of the financial year on 30th of june the governmental institutions are pillaged the american establishment before the expiry of its term gave a green signal to israel to do whatever she wants
on one hand america says that effort will be made for ceasefire
on the other side the united nation is passing one resolution over another but both have done nothing practically this means that united nation is also working to crush the muslims
all muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the united nations and should establish their own global organisation
we have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of america and the united nations are seen but the harm is only done to the muslims
what is the use of this probaganda when bbc is not going to publish it
where have all the rules of journalism been buried when blood specifically of muslims is spilled the monster of unbiasedness gets onto bbcs back
which considers itself the standard bearer of truth
pubslishing something from their own sounds far they even dint publish the discussions
the only difference between you and the jews is that they call themselves jews and martyr the muslims and the likes of you stay among muslims call yourselves muslims and cause muslims
syja786
long time since in the forums of bbc a specific cult has been targeted sometimes in suicide attacks and sometimes in terrorism happening in india
the favorite word of these antiislamic discussions was extremism
but who is extremist that you can easily figure out from the above comment
when will our muslims understand that dajjal can not be fought with the sword
after watching israels bombings on unarmed people what would ones tearfilled heart do
but the basic fault is of this turmoil and massacre which by naming jihad we try to blacken the beautiful face of islam
when majority of the palestinians have accepted the existece of israel then what need does hamas have to send rockets into israel or conduct suicide attacks
the conduct of both sides is misanthropist
the role of un and the usa was again seen as favoring towards the injustice of israel
may allah allow the muslim nation to unite amen
and the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism after all they are doing the real work
otherwise is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are
in easy words such gangsters are told to do whatever they want
hitting people hard and leave them to cry
the arab rulers are giving medicines for the injuredfuneral clothings for the dead and money and they are asking
what should be done about israeli attacks
the actual problem is that the leaders of all the muslim countries including the saudi king are in a deep sleep they neither have an army nor any protective plans they think they can support and fulfill their responsibility
they should immediately take practical steps against the israel
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to european countries and america but alas they
greetings to all brothers and sisters
i believe that in this time of difficulty telling hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans and it is similar to considering them defeated
if israel and its supporters are at the height of their pharoahism soon moses will be born within their house as this is the rule of nature as the steps taken by america and israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the muslims
which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing
abu abdullah pakistan
hamas and israel should reconcile so that this bloodshed comes to an end
mohammad sarfraz paris france
rightly said
lets suppose that hamas is really the righteous one and they have waged jihad against the tyranny to become successful in the divine court even then they should at least realize that if good brings harm to the people then it is of no use
those who claim to love god his prophet(pbuh) and their religion to love humanity is part of their belief
as if it is the order of allah to evacuate all the people of the book from the face of the earth other than the muslims
najeeburrehman psycho lahore pkitn
no not to kill them but rather the order is to invite them to islam
but jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion
these people should be fought with unless they stop these conspiracies but this doesnt mean at all that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering
brothers the fate of the murderer of innocent children is annihilation
but i ask my friends that the israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past have become so strong today that they dont listen to any one this is because the jews are united
there are no sheas and sunnis there are all just jews and they have developed everything in every field
in contrast what is the condition of 55 islamic countries
they are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death
it is essential that all muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against israel
feroz magsi jhang pakistan
and there is no better strategy that recognize israel learn modern education and means of progress and let the world live in peace and harmony
muslims have plenty of land and resources
the need is correct usage
this first most disappointing factor is that hamas and alfateh could not unite
great leaders like yasir arafat and sheikh yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing jihad for the aqsa mosque and this was impossible without removing yasin and arafat from the way
the world is witnessing that how palestine had been scattering after the death of these two leaders
and how the jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip
in 1974 a pakistani prime minister was of such an international trust that first time in history he united all the muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance
today on his 81st birthday is it a very difficult task that the whole nation promise to not only keep unity in its lines
but by eliminating the differences between other muslims will accomplish its (establishment of islamic common wealth) incomplete mission
this is a jinn which has entered palestine for half a century
this jin has many mouths
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world
and its other mouths are eating humans in iraq afghanistan iran and pakistan
this monster is most unhappy with islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through islam muslims the perfect religion of muslim and practical islam as the history tells that islam has put giants like abu jehl on the right path
bombing from israeli fighter planes on gaza has continued since 27th of december
more that 3 hundred palestinians have been killed in these attacks
after the arial attacks israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council the united nations has demanded israel and the palestinian authorities to ceasefire
however the israeli authorities say that they will continue operation in gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on israel have stopped
in your opinion is the statement by israel that this is an israeli struggle for safety acceptable
is the world community playing its role in such situation
does this aggression has an indirect relation with the coming elections in israel
can there be any expectation of improvement in the middle east situation after newly elected president barack obama takes office
(please note that due to an increase in the number of comments only comments typed in urdu will be published

palestine is a holy place for us and its defence is our duty
we should also remember that it was our first qiblah
israel and india have to vanish one day since these countries are made to be broken and god will surely torment these disbelievers sajid sadiq lahore
when the night of loneliness can be passed by tearing down
when has misfortune departed by praying only (nawabzada nasrullah khan)
bbc searches for such comments and publishes them
after all it has to keep up the flag and perception of nonalignment
though bbc news are often true but the real thing is the delivery
what should be pointed out and what news should be given less importance
etc etc
zaheer chughtai
in this art now a days the pakistani electronic and print media specially some urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the grudge of muavia written on them
has said that the united nations which apparently talks of human rights and peace but when it comes to grimness and coercion over muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that hamas should stop the attacks how long this hypocrisy will continue
why there is so much atrocity on muslims if people like america leave backing up of jews then allah almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life so if americans you have courage then leave backing up of them and see then their fate of life
all these world renowned leaders and people who murder innocents in the name of peace should realize that peace in the world can only be achieved by justice and not through injustice or wiping entire races
if killing a particular race off completely is the answer then hitlers plan would not have seen any jews survive and definitely not seen their rise
says a poet
injustice is injustice if it breeds it dies
blood is blood if it bleeds it dries
now who will tell whom what is terrorism
is all this not included in terrorism why does everybody worry only about their own pain
are others not human or is it that the blood of muslims has become so cheap was the blood of this many innocent not red
and now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere
i watched the progress of the mumbai incident as if my own house was on fire the sorrow of humans can not be watched and who can not see this sorrow if only muslims would think a bit together
dead bodies on the road helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood how shall we condemn i can not find words
i feel like crying about the helplessness of muslims that on one side people are dying in india and the whole world is climbing onto pakistan without any proof and saying take action or else we will
and on the other side israel is ruthlessly killing muslims and the whole world is silent this is unbearable
god has light not darkness and when this darkness ends then
in the presence of america danger to the integrity of israel is a joke
considering elections the rulers should do such activities for peoples support there is no doubt in this specially when countries like israel exist rest talking about barrack obama then history is the witness that no american leader has gone against the policy and nor will do it regime whether black or white is a regime
from the discussions going on in the forum it seems that everyone is hurt over her death but as a politician her mistakes have not been ignored
this issue is debatable as to whether benazir gave her life for democracy or for power
if democracy was dearer why did she leave the republic for ten years in the control of musharraf waiting for american clearance and deal
benazir did not come to pakistan when the people needed her the most unfortunately she came to pakistan when she had to deal with cases and was promised a seat of power
there is no one remaining to say about the criticism and accusations of a historical personality
sana khan
some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them
another reader
sirmadam maybe if you read not only the history of pakistan but of its neighboring four countries or of seven other countries then you might understand the meaning of mr psycho
tariq ayaz
those who dont deserve such education shouldnt get it either
remain green in water
britain never let them become one and invented the hindumuslim friction which was taken ahead by sir syed
psycho
how merciless is our nation we are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued no one is saying a word
we have progressed enough
sana khan
some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them just like a donkey doesnt become a scholar if you put books on him
although after the mumbai attacks there has been a setback in the dialog between pakistan and india however pakistan and india should continue these dialogs
if we talk of war then it will bring loss of humans from both sides
india says that the man caught in the mumbai attacks is a pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to pakistan in urdu but on the other hand when india initially apprehended this extremist they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader point to be noted
first of all merry christmas to mr bhana and all christian friends of the forum
friends of the forum greetings mr psycho a raza sister sana sister shahida akram and all
we do not want the flames of war we want the flowers of peace
war itself is a problem
what problems can war solve
it will give fire and blood today
it will give hunger and need tomorrow
therefore o intelligent people
it is better that war keeps postponing
in your and our garden
its better if lamp glows
the indiaamerica relations have deepened and india knows that when the time comes america will openly betray pakistan
this is also the old history of america
because in the case of an indian attack americas goals will also be fulfilled and the expenses will be indias
pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace reconciliation and ceasefire until india is completely destroyed or occupied even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so
this is the islamic history
even before this resolution the pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give
indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the mumbai attacks are making it more clever that effected and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has relaxed its pressure now
while ignoring indias unnecessary bobbery the satisfaction of the united nations and the appreciation from the interpol chief over pakistans efforts is a side effect of indias overwhelming diplomacy
there are no two opinions over this that it is a heinous act
but the question is that when thousands of taliban attacked the house of pir samiullah where and what was the pakistani army doing at that time
should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past one year
how many taliban are killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday
and stop this fake operation
the day is not far when a resolution will be passed in the united nations against army intervention in pakistan in the same way as it was passed against jamaathuddawah
first our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and god forbid the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in un
and supposing the passing of such a resolution is delayedsome other strength will definitely leave our aid to ourself keeping the example of america in front of them
we do not know about the personality and works of pir samiullah
probably he was not a revolutionary
as the bodies of comrade che guevara nawab akbar khan bagti dr najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy
they are immortal even after they die
but here an international game is being played here ferrocity and animosity is created to do the ruling
so that license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will clutch the government
such actions of the so called islam lovers in the name of religion is extremely disagreeable
the supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of america but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions give it the name of tribal traditions and clearly avoid it
any person with a heart can never accept these beastly actions which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of islam
in my opinion people of our army are with these people
that is because when they change destination it takes time but to catch them forget about getting there on time even if they are on the spot they leave from there
are they so brave that they keep 5070 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators
they are also the human beings and the army
it is clear that something is sinister
instead of promoting gods blessing and merciful nature discussing various disastrous and lesson gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen and besides the event of hanging the dead body their literature and books like what will happen after death also create fear and terror
and these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power
preachers
you frightened the world form fire of hell
it is surprising when it is said that this can not be a work of a muslim
we are either unaware of our own history or we ignore it for some reason
was the attack of yazids forces on medina not the act of christians and the jews
without accepting the facts neither motives can be removed nor these can be corrected
bbc people stop this dual policy
better than this topic the super hit title shoeing of bush fair or unfair
should have been
tahir chowdary japan
be ashamed the body of a person was taken out of the grave and hanged on a pole because he spoke against the cruelty and you are struck up over the topic of box office
for the success of operation sherdil and across the border the success of operation lion heart depends on the favor of people
this act is of american and pakistani agencies and peer sahab is a victim of this conspiracy
all discussions on this forum will now be anti taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined taliban and they are doing what can change the public opinion
i only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day what was the army doing are they only there for targeting the public they even report something like this bombing on taliban residences a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother
did they not know about this mistake
or were they watching the show
we say it with excuse that stop this game for allah sake
after all there is a ruler above you
whether the question asked by bbc is understandable or not it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer for instance no one asked what the army of 30000 in swat went there to do
that the bodies of the taliban who helps the army is left hanging on poles throughout the day
whatever the green footed pakistani government did with the swat public the media including bbc did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality
the pakistani army drama
every child in swat is saying that this is a bloody drama
for gods sake stop this drama
these talibans have destroyed the image of muslims
through out the world if muslims dont tell them muslims then why would terrorists are found in their territories
those who become insensitive and people who dont want to work hard take guns and join these groups
have shame
its need is neither in any religion nor in any customs
all media including bbc show different views on taliban and tribals
but nobody knows what the actual situation is it is we who know about it because we are tribals
in short this is a game in which cia raw musad and our own isi is involvedthere is nothing like taliban or tribal people they are the negative elements created by these institutions who are spoiling the name of islam taliban religous institutes pukhtoon nation and tribals
this move has ashamed all the muslims
i salute mqms altaf hussain and the leadership of anp and ppp who speak against this cancer that is taliban
this cancer is a product of ziaulhaq who died but also destroyed pakistan
but i am hopeful that current leadership will end this cancer
after mumbai attacks india said that some extremists are behind the attacks
pakistan denies that blames and said he will give all possible help to india in interrogation
india said that it has given a list to pakistan that has 20 suspected extremists required by india
now pakistan said that the jaishemohammad leader who is included in the list moulana masood azhar is not under house arrest and that the government of pakistan has no information about him
previously the president of pakistan asif ali zardari had rejected the idea that western intelligence agencies and the indian government had provided pakistan proof about the mumbai attacks
president zardari said regarding ajmal kasab that it is not yet proven that he is pakistani
meanwhile prime minister manmohan singh has warned pakistan that its relation with india can not improve unless its land is being used for terrorism
and in a latest development the indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to pakistan
should these political events affect sports
what do you see the future of indopak relations looking like
neither america nor india will break pakistan
pakistan will break itself
what do you expect after so much provincialism sectarianism and mullaism
time has proved that jinnah did not do good to the indian muslims
yasmin chicago
madam if work was continued in jinnahs manner neither would the tumors of regionalism factionism and infiltration have spread in pakistan nor would the indian muslims been treated in this way
but its our fault that we could not bring up a leader like his stature
if we cant respect our leaders then
this sector does have a lot of abilities
god knows when well understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity
in both countries the mullahs pundits taliban shiv sena and the rss etc have been established to oppose the peace process
and the evil powers dont want this region to progress therefore these countries are controlled like puppets
can you imagine what status will this region of pakistan india and china will have in the world
pakistan is under persecution from god that these thieves bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation
may allah protect our country from any harm amen
butplease open your eyes to look at the situation and ground realities around you then you will come to know that where american troops have reached
besides the country matters do not seems betterthe circumstances in nwfp baluchistanand the situation of karachi in sindh are also in front of you
in this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation
o allah have mercy on us
i think a last war is the only option
enough is enough
now it should be do or die
these false acts of cooperation will not solve the problem
nor will small terrorist attacks in each others countries
after all europe got settled after the final world war
and if this world war had not taken place then these countries just like pakistan and india would have been clattering
almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be finished
but our military leadership does not seem to be sincere in these regards on the one hand america and europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism and on the other hand we secretly help the taiban
we should think and fix our direction and choose only one way thanks
there is no doubt that the majority of the movement league are from the tayaba group who joined the league after the inception of pakistan
although these members preferred subsidiary activities and now after indias great persistence the united nation has invalidated it also and government of pakistan is continuing the crack down against them
in my opinion it is better if jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities
the terrorist organizations present in pakistan are employing professional criminals in the name of jihad the mentors of these and the mullahs are the same people who called pakistan paleedistan and what not from time to time
now they are not leaving any stone unturned in destroying pakistan
they do not deserve to be called humans let alone muslims
without cleaning pakistan of these mischief mongers the national security will remain at risk
is there still room for consideration whether these scoundrels should be banned
there is no place in this world for extremist mullahs whose only purpose is to kill
this news tore my heart
what world is this where it is hard to survive for the one who names an important part of allahs religion islam
nonmuslims can kill muslims but if a muslim even tries to extract revenge along with the whole nonmuslim world even the hypocrite leaders join and treat those who have sincere religious feeling in the manner our great leaders are treating hafiz saeed
as a penalty of mumbai attacks india
pakistan relations are affected and the recent improvement of relations between two countries is enormously shocked
india has always held the military and nonmilitary groups in pakistan responsible
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the action against these groups
whereas indian security agencies have accused lashkaretaiba of being directly responsible for the mumbai attacks
in this regard jamat adawa has also been nominated
this is the first time that relation between both the countries have worsen due to a terrorist activity in india
in december 2001 after the attacks on indian parliament these two neighbors were on the brink of war
after that in 2002 lashkeretayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists
now it is being demanded that jamaathud dawah which according to security reports is just a new form of lashkaretaiba also be banned
in your opinion should this group be banned or not
should pakistan take decisive action against active extremist groups on her soil
can by banning jamat adawa present india
pak crisis to subside and how important is it for permanent peace between the two countries that armed groups be dismantled
security council of the united nations has banned jamatuddawa after all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly
does the security council always show this type of urgency against the muslims
this is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness
india itself has become a failed government
whose intelligence army and other security officials has become useless who for 72 hours have danced the dance of mole with terrorists and india is cheating the world by blaming pakistan over its uselessness
when one disbeliever dies there is hue and cry in the whole world why these double standards
countries only religious and nonpolitical welfare organization
furqan farooq faisalabad
as long as our prophet (pbuh) the awliya kiram and the sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect the religion of islam would spread and prosper with peace
muslims have also advanced in every field
but when this beautiful religion rose to the hands of distillation then within the human beings began the difference of religious and disbeliever and the new gateways of pride and prejudice began to open by which the world was unknown before
salam please do it with pleasure but act at your own
dont do it under the pressure of america
if india is aggrieved it should provide the evidence
why doesnt it give it
and why do they accuse us with everything
there are extremist groups and organizations in india as well why dont they put sanctions on them
are we the only terrorists in the world
what is it that india is doing in kashmir
what is it that israel is doing
the truth is that we are the first islamic nuclear state why is what the fight is about
pakistan is now in the last stages
kamranhassan abu dhabi
your words touch the heart and the situation seems so
now american magazines are very boldly printing the new map of pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be the part of this conspiracy
the americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over pakistan
in this situation if we do not stand together and show our unity then remember if bangladesh can be made then anything can happen
terrorist attacks should be condemned to the maximum whether they are on the mumbai hotel or the marriot hotel in islamabad or in palestine
like this terorrists should be pounished where they will where from pakistanindiaamerica or israel
now the question is that why the whole world including the pakistani officials are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in pakistan resulting in the death of hundreds of people
was the attack on mariat hotal not by terorrists
then why
hats off to home advisor mr rahman malik masha allah he has become so brave and courageous
not only this but according to bbc mr malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under someoness pressure
brother subhanallah
whether having the ability or not or to say that i dont want
whose war we pakistanis are fighting
and why we have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect
no one has the right to interfere in any countrys affairs
the colonial system is apparently not there
if people expect justice or demand that an external united court be established respect democratic institutions and not help any dictator or army man there will be peace in the third world including pakistan which i think is not acceptable by those calling for unity
pakistan is already in favour of europian union and america
this happens despite the opposition of a majority of the pakistani population
and this causes more opposing feelings
if america and its allies believe in democracy they should give up their colonial behavior and leave this region
pakistan has ability to arm or disarm
security forces raid an alleged camp of banned lashkr e taiba in pakistan administered kashmir
since the mumbai attacks pressure is increasing on pakistan to act against the extremist organizations
indias accusation is that lashkaretaiba is involved in the mumbai attacks
she says that no doubt the extremists responsible for mumbai attacks used pakistani soil
in the meanwhile officials in peshawar claim that the lot of trucks which carry supplies to the united forces in afghanistan was burnt by unidentified armed people because of which more than 50 trucks were destroyed
this is the second attack in peshawar on nato and american supplies in the last 48 hours
during this pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned lashkr e taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from karachi to tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action
the question is does pakistan want to do it
does pakistan have the ability to do so
what do you say

i ask only one question from flag holders of humanity
if you kill their children and they bring necklace for you this is impossible
and question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies say any logic argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men laborers and poor workers of different occupations in revenge of american attack
if your answer is no then you need to correct your point of view
peoples were armed at that time it was feared that after afghanistan russia will attack pakistan so people were armed
now when there is the danger of american attack via afghanistan of which current american president clearly expressed in his presidential campaign then why should we disarm these people
only for this that after defeating pakistani army america or india may not face any public resistance
yes if any of them is involved in sabotage activities then only pakistan should take action against him
but it is sad that the fact that lashkaretaiba is involved proves indias claim that pakistan is guilty in this
najeebur rahman syco lahore
even if we accept that lashkaretaiba is guilty it is still not correct to blame the pakistani government
and another question arises that did these terrorists not have the aid of some government or nongovernment employee of india
are terrorists only born or prepared in pakistan and not in any other country of the world
as far as laskare tayyaba is concern it has no involvement in the recent incidents
it must be recalled that hafiz saeed was the first militant leader who declared activities of taliban revolt
i am quite sure that taliban agitation is a vital part of american plans so every person or organization must be eliminated who challenges taliban in any aspect
to terminate the expedition started by the american and saudi funding they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society
one should also protest against them that according to what ethics america and saudi arabia distributed dangerous weapons and named jihadis but in the reality spread the virus of hateful literature and culture due to which slaughter houses were open in our country
after the threat of attack from india announcement of the pakistani army that they will divert their attention to india by removing the army from afghanistan and the announcement of taliban that they will take care of the afghan border america stumbled badly and tried its best that india should attack pakistan
this showed the strength of america in the region
although india did not even threatened nor it has the guts to
the taliban attacked and finished most of the remaining american supplies
that proves that without the pakistani army and tha pakistani government america is nothing
karachi business financial center of pakistan is dubai of underdeveloped areas
hundreds of thousands do not return empty handed from here but since the law was enforced on the western borders karachi has taken all the attention
now they are looking to kidnap this city
for the first time pathans are called pashtoons they are made to fight by making them strangers to each other although the need is to be united
one solution of the problem is that the urdu speaking people learn pushto or the pushto speaking learn urdu or if everyone learns english the better
you will certainly think of the suggestion as absurd but dont you think the cause of the conflict is bizarre
that reason of violence is language
zaheer chughtai
sir i actually shared this proposal many times in my childhood with my friends which included people from all religious and linguistic groups but these people used to laugh at me
at that time the religious and linguistic hate which was not as lively and strong as they are today were still developing within
do not understand what and why is this happening
are these the signs of the day of judgement
for what crime are innocent people being killed
the reasons are in front of everybody those who want to break up pakistan are the active ones and those who do such things have neither religion nor country
whether it be karachi or mumbai the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns
when the government comes they just change names of the places to build a name for themselves just like these days airports roads buildings are all named benazir
does benazir mean that which is happening to the public of karachi and pakistan
when bombay attacks were at their peak the failure of efforts of ra to initiate turmoil in karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of ra have now resigned from their posts
unjustified killing of pashto speaking hard workers and indian threats have awaken sleeping pakistanis from karachi to khyber
the identical country loving reaction of all the political religious linguistic and national parties has not only taught india the manners of diplomacy but it has also given the american policy makers a chance to think again
mqm and anp are responsible for the worse situation in karachi and administration is not neutral
administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately
pressure of political parties on police and rangers keeps them from doing the operation
the talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches the political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man
until there is pressure on the administration these kind of incidents will keep taking place
i think these people are the biggest terrorists
and foreign powers are definitely involved in this but no one knows who they are
but alas that if these incidents were in any city of nwfp then what would the government have done over there but since its not in nwfp the government seems to be helpless
the government should set up an operation here and save a big and important town from terrorism
otherwise pakistan will face a huge financial crisis
even bbc urdu is not writing the truth due to fear and as for the local media it is even thinner
the whole truth is available on bbc english
one solution to the problem is that either the urdu speaking people learn pushtun or the pushtun speaking people learn urdu or even better both learn english
you will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but dont you think the reason for collision is ridiculous
that the cause of extremism be language
there was another story of cruelness recorded in karachi terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time
wherever one could do something he did everything reports on the media are 50 of what has happened here in four days
last three nights were sleepless and are still afraid
who evacuated hotels killed cobblers peanut sellers
the people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of allahs punishment which can catch them anytime
in your opinion what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance
(bbc)
keeping in view the gruesome bloodshed event in mumbai we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in karachi it is simple and easy to guess that the turmoil is just due to an unconcious trade of blood
it is obvious that if someone mistreats the father it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control
the blood of liyaqath ali khan and many other brave hearts was also from there i am writing this poem to get rid of saikos misunderstanding
we will also repeat the traditions of the elders
they gave their lives to build we will give our lives to save
faizan tauseef siddiqui
it is very disappointing that whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other
mr siddiqui i request if wikipedia
org is searched for liaqat ali khan you will know that he belonged to a noble punjabi family of an area of punjab karnal
due to his services for muhajirs they consider him their leader
every action has a reaction
one can bear ones self but
ijaz awan
sir before you gather a huge crowd very quickly i should tell you that you are finding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters
we have been bearing both types of mischief
mischief mongers did not leave pakistan or the founder of pakistan they did not have to face any reaction
in returncreating problems for the same countrypakistan
only muslim league (n) was left she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to peoples party
before this mqm and muslim league q have made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment in the national assembly and the senate
till now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved
this is the reason why no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change
it seems that by submitted the draft of 18th amendment these parties has beaten around the bushes means they can claim that we had submitted the amendment but the ruling partys speaker did not proceed
mqm is i coalation with government muslim league(n) is secret partnership with government and muslim league(q) is the party that passed 17th ammendment then how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17th amendment
this is what is called getting credit for nothing
peoples party anyway is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment
how can someone think of cutting their own hands
as long as zardari is the president seventeenth amendment is not going to be cancelled
this was the opinion of majority in one of our survey and it is also correct
if 17th amendment was to be discarded then zardari would have never become the president
now he is more powerful than president musharraf since along with president he is also the chairman of peoples party
as long as he is the president the seventeenth amendment will remain intact
in order to cancel the seventeenth amendment the political parties will first have to dismiss president zardari from the presidency
neither mqm nor other parties want this
most of the elders in our family belong to labor class
in our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor work we used to pray to allah that please save us from this hard labor work
to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily amroz and asked him what should we do after matriculation so that we dont have to do labor work
the editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and take such and such subjects
we were inclined towards engineering and in matriculation we studied technical drawing instead of biology
but at the time of admission in fsc my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing fsc in medical
we hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldnt understand a thing we swapped biology for mathematics
means that the fear from labor work made me an engineer and now i am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which i am always thankful to god
this we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons
we said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor
the son said that i am studying and will continue studying but i cannot do this work
anyway the three of us finished that work in three hours and returned
the point of saying is that if a person picks his destiny whatever is the reason behind it no one can stop him from achieving that destiny
but if you dont even know what you have to do then god be with you
it is said that do not say bad about the dead but what shall we do we see only bad things in benazir even on her first death anniversary
on one side benazir crushed independence movement of sikhs by handing over the list of sikh freedom fighters to india for her own sake and on the other hand provided india an opportunity to fully concentrate in kashmir after crushing the movement in punjab
the greed of benazir and nawaz sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years
during her exile benazir continued to give negative statements on kashmir and atomic program
benazir violated the london agreement with nawaz sharif and made a deal with general musharaf
during her reign benazir provided her husband the opportunity of making money and because of this he popularized as mr 10 percent
in benazirs era her brother was killed and his killer is still not been punished
despite being a woman benazir avoided fighting for women rights
just like benazir did her politics over her fathers dead body similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body
benazir came into power twice but she could not punish her the culprits of her fathers political murder even she couldnt register a case against them
it has been 37 years since east pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day
we should have been observing 16th december as a day of reflection and made plans to prevent the re occurrence of such incidents
on this day we could send greeting to the people of bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again
the rulers would reopen the hamudur rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of east pakistan
they used to make arrangements to bring back the baharis stuck in bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits
we have become so insensitive that if someone dies in our neighborhood we are not even aware of it
we do not care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish
even after big tragedies we return to our routine life the next day
if only east and west pakistan could become one again like east and west germany became one
we can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness
but this wish does not seem to be fulfilled in the near future
when it was announced in the news today that the governor of the american state illinois was arrested for corruption charges
and to remove him from governorship provincial congress is preparing for his rapid accountability our american friend who has a keen interest in pakistani affairs exaggeratedly said to me see this is democracy
in america even the higher level people can not transcendence the law
and there is your country pakistan whose president has been elected after dropping of corruption charges
my sense of humor rouse and i said whats strange if a governor has been arrested in america in our pakistan prime minister was arrested overnight and once was hanged and second time was exiled
tell me has it ever happened in america
pakistan awarded guard of honor and bid farewell from the president house who broke the law of the country tell me if anything like this has happened in america
in pakistan the chief justice was suspended in such a way that besides the public support he has not be restored so far did it ever happened in america
in pakistan a fakedegree holder was made the minister of health did this happen in america
by hearing this american laughed like mads and also accepted his defeat
in this picture president zardari is smiling despite being surrounded on all four sides by americans
it seems from his smile
he thinks that america is with his government he is forgetting that one year ago they were with pervez musharraf
this picture has been taken as it was a family gathering
a photo like this was never published in the papers before one president with three american officials
it seems as if americas work in pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one
it is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of president zardari breaking his promises
if it had been a sensible ruler at least he would not have been grinning during the photo session and he would have had a subservient and embarrassing look on his face
if the principle of democracy is applied on this picture then present zardari is in minority
in democracy majority rules the country and the picture reveals the actual rulers
paradiselike swat is also called the switzerland of pakistan
till now according to government policy cross talks are also going along with the power use
but the use of force is not giving any benefit other than increasing the force of the taliban and increasing the public favor for them
what is needed of the government is to address the root cause of this menace instead of using force
by finishing the causes fazlullah and the taliban will be finished themselves
the sharia bill proposed by anp will become the solution of the problems of swat to a great extent
but alongside the establishment of the shariah the government will also have to take care of economic problems
from the early steps of general musharaf it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians but the lust of power changed all his plans
and whatever steps were expected were no more
as soon as bushs era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment he made a deal with the thieves
even then general musharraf could have commanded the army but the present government does not even know what is happening
in swat the strongly affected part of sarhad state despite the continuity of military action for over one year the situation is still going from bad to worse
on one hand the writ of govt is limited to a resolution of condemnation passed by national assembly while on other hand the influence of talibans fm channel is increasing in swat
on the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area
the security forces claim killing many extremists during gunship helicopter attacks and artillery bombardment but in spite of these killings the talibans has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of swat
as a result on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat and on the other hand the taliban is stronger
who is stuck in between the poor civilians
it is said in swat that someone asked what kind of people are the taliban were so he got the answer they are very good as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of allah and the religion
then asked how is army the answer was that the army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country
then it was asked who are the enemies of religion and country the answer was the citizens
i am astonished how the pakistan army will fight with the indian army while it is unable to control a small group of talibans
they could not track the illegally set up fm channel of the taliban which i believe was very easy
but still the fm channel is spreading poison with all vigor
after the girls schools now boys schools are being destroyed
curfew is imposed so that tablibans can move around easily
tonight 8 trucks entered the suburbs of mingora during curfew and created bunkers
the question is that how could they reach there during curfew
the army could kill akbar bugti in his house but salutes the taliban
for god sake someone tells this army to protect helpless people of sawat from taliban and prove that pakistan army can overcome any enemy
you say that mostly blood is spilled in the world because of religion tell me today if there was no religion would all this killing not take place
are punjabi pathan white black mahsood and other tribes the result of religion
not at all sir religion preaches us that there is no white black punjabi or muhajir if there is no religion then half of the world would have been destroyed by the war of black and white and remaining half by the war of cast
actually religion gives moral teachings to the man and binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here and he should spent his life according to his rules
as a muslim i am completely convinced that islam is a complete way of life and the true religion
after settling down in london every morning i would first call my relatives and ask them how they were most of them had never called me to find out how i was doing and i then realized that they do not like me calling them either so i stopped calling them
living here in france for two years i also felt the same way
i dont know why people always expect us to call them
resolution about iraq passed in a few hours sending un peace force to darfur is not a problem
immediately criticizing the mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours
and where death is dancing we are doing consensus
o upholders of world peace life is finishing over here
if that really awaited for its ending
so that any again no aggrieved could even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights
when a father keeps running taking the dead body of his beloved soneven then you dont feel any pain in your heart
if not then you dont even deserve to be called human being
rather you are a black spot on the name of humanity
ok this was proved that this area was also the home of the israelis for thousands of years
ideally these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection but since their strings are in the hands of the western and arab countries therefore peace is not possible without their will
and now even iran wants to fight its proxy war from here
even if operations in israel are stopped for the time being they will start again after some other incident
the interest of bbcs country is subject to the bestowing of america and israel and this is the reason why in the name of enlightenment they have come with a series of blogs based on darkness and doing oneway and a blind propaganda
bbc is only carrying the formality and its objective is to have sympathies
it is requested to mr moderator that he must publish this review so that it may be proved bbc has element of realism to some extent
thanks
i dont know who wrote this story or how this story came to being but one thing is for sure in every age draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people
in every age wars have been fought and blood has been spilled
but the surprising thing is that this 21st century man who considers himself civilized is quiet over this ruthless open massacre
how can he not realize that whatever is happening is showing the ugliest face of humanity

sometimes every drop is like pain
even these rains are from you
all these leaders are about to run holding a very sensitive case little do they care if the country survives or not
let the population sell toothpaste or clean the bells of the mandir with the peels of lemons
for one our media is also corrupted like our leaders
its sole purpose is to extract money from the government
as for the public they are ignorant to speak about them is the biggest ignorance
yesterday noon strange thing happened
all together police running here and there but not ask on illegal parking
not this nypd traffic was not in the mood of noticing illegally parked vehicles
it happened that a plane of us air force actually became a ship and landed in hudson river
till today only this much is known that the terrorist belonged to the family of birds called goose
yesterday was perhaps historic cold in new york
the temperature does not fall this much
my jaw start to ache because of half an hour outside walk
just imagine what would have happened with those who jumped of the plane into the river
the reason for happiness is that all the person were safe
and sad news is that ship of company sank in this financial crisis

we considered taliban group of swat nonreligious freely which were only against women education
they were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day
but like majority of the ideas this was not proven right also according to this news of cnn on the lucky day of monday a group of taliban demolished a boys school with gunpowder
south taliban has demolished boys school
the girls schools were already destroyed acting according to the famous english saying ladies first i do not know why people are still bent on calling the taliban uncultured and barbaric
another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the taliban that they are against girls education is not true
rather masha allah they are against education altogether
may allah give these mujahideen more power and the evil government
destroying those who rule on us may allah help them
some days go a girls marriage with a dog become fresh

humanity is rare in 21st century
today is the age of computer and computers interference is growing in every aspect of life
lots of people have many reservations about this growing interference of computer like in financial issues
where use of credit card bring ease to life it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life
that just by tracking the record of your credit card you can be exposed
and in future when use of currency will be minimal its utility will increase
similarly in the world of crimes instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank the credit card information is stolen
similarly friends are also made through computers
social networking websites like orcet facebook and myspace are ranked first in popularity
but do you not think that the more we are following these social networking sites the further we are getting from people in real life
similar are the match making websites where your desires are matched with others desires and you are shown a list of the people who match with you
now can you spend your life with a person exactly like you
i cant do it that is why a life partner is known as better half
that heshe may cover my deficiencies
perhaps i received a lesser share of wisdom
since childhood when ever an elder said anything to me that was the truth for me
in the same way i was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world
there was laughed upon me for it
but only that saying seemed true which could be possible
i was always perplexed at the need of telling a lie
even at this age he was harmed by this
that is why i try to lie as less as possible
dont say lie specially in the name of god
and allah willing say only when there is pray to allah that work completes
rest god knows all abut your will
this is a disgusting problem which is created due to reason of distance from religion
according to our religion and the law of pakistan minor should stay with their mother
their father is responsible for their maintenance allowance and he can meet them
then when the kids become mature they can decide with whom they want to live
you have mentioned correctly that the real problem is the relatives who poison the minds
possessiveness is present in all our actions
even here is thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in fathers property so it is resisted although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated
these restrictions have caused social evils even in our marriages
concept of marriage of a divorced or a widow is ending
due these unnecessary beliefs and tradition the family system is facing disarray
in our society if the wife of a 5055 year old man or the husband of such a wife passes away why are they not looked at in a nice manner
there is a pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago now after getting all his children married when he married a widow his own children have gone against him
in my opinion this is religious right what do you say
to take place of our mother in the being of our mother what kind of thinking
i believe that this persons children should have thought what is wrong if he married a widow after he married off all his children
thereby this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house
because his children would certainly be busy in their worldly affairs and would not be having time for him
the reason for this is ignorance
this result is because of societies pressure
when people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that children start to feel ashamed of their fathers second marriage
though they should face the environment and say that their fathers action is in perfect accordance with islam
this is the curse of our society which we are facing for the last 4050 years
even a wife is agreed on the unethical activities of her husband but does not allow her for second marriage
if she had the power she wont allow him of this even after her death
she destroys her husband and her own hereafter and becomes a cause for spreading filthiness in the society
nothing happens with singing about islam we actually like what our traditions and cultures are
for example keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage
as for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt)
in indoppak we embraced islam centuries ago but cant get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then islam
thinking of a mans second marriage as an innovation divorce as a clinical rest divorced woman as untouchable love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife is all a part of this mentality
moreover to copy the western nations we declare veil and worship backward
it was easy to embrace islam to get rid of such thinking is very difficult
allah grant us all spirit and courage for this

when i was coming back to the shop after isha prayer tonight one man who was sitting in car raised his hand and asked me to come
i thought that probable this man has lost his way or wants to ask something i stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car
he asked whether i could understand arabic well or not i said no problem tell me what you want
he started to say that i have come from riyadh to madinah but someone has pickpocketed me so please help me out i asked him to excuse me as such an incident had taken place with me previously that i had given the person 20 riyals to buy petrol to reach riyadh but he went a little ahead and started to ask somebody else
i was furious i cursed him and threatened him of the police then he ran away
now the situation has become that we muslims come on cars with our families to beg throughout the day and gain at least two or three thousand illegally
however there is a clear hadith (saaw) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one
may allah bless us and make us true muslims (amen)

it is all these peoples doing kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years
no no one asked and they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism so they start talking about making up
first they killed muslims brutally now they are trying to resolve issues
anyways pakistan should understand their double policies
asad khan london
india is creating such a situation that the worlds attention can be diverted from kashmir
but pakistan has always shown the real face of india to the world
now the british government is also understanding that the indians are taking cover from their occupation over kashmir by blaming pakistan of terrorism
and they hesitate to talk to pakistan over this issue
british foreign minister david miliband said that by resolving kashmir issue will end extremism pakistan government will be able to handle the border issues
it should be noted that american president obama has already expressed similar views on kashmir issue
the british foreign minister while talking to media in mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president bush
david miliband has said that pakistan should show lineancy towards extremist groups
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the kashmir dispute from the major powers isnt india trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region
isnt the terrorism in mumbai a part of this strategy
does india want to avoid the comprehensive talks by on the basis of terrorism

i think the big powers do not want to harm pakistan
but are thinking of plans to keep it in their leash as they know that pakistan is a nuclear power
they want to create an environment of a revolution
foreign counties are thinking that if pakistan is cornered that will pose more political and geographical problems they want to help pakistan and want to achieve their vested interests

indians have known to be snakes in the grass
i think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn pakistan
we are ready in all ways the indian chief of army should keep his mouth shut or else we know how to give mouth breaking anwers

american president george w bush in his last press conference advises newly elected president that he did many mistakes in his tenure and barack obama should do what he think is right
as the president i have taken steps according to the situation and the constitution and under the law given priority to the american interests on my popularity
he said that the enemies of america are still planning to attack america and that the biggest challenge for barack obama would be to stop those attacks
he said that not to get the mass destruction weapons was my largest disappointment and the biggest mistake was to admit the completion of the iraq mission

this is a sad calamity that israeli is massacring the palestinians and the same situation is prevalent in kashmir but there is no effect on the security council
all the groups that are in kashmir and palestine should keep the war going for freedom and unitedly fight any force that opposes them one day their martyrdom will bear fruit god willing
israeli air attacks are still continued on gaza hundreds of palestinian men women and children have been martyred
important political leader of hamas nazarian have been martyred with wife and kids
here the security council meeting concluded without any decision
the condemning resolution presented by libia and other arab countries against israel is facing american opposition in the meeting
israels jet planes have been bombarding on the residential areas of palestine for last many days
the whole world reacted on mumbai attacks but no country including america and england can see bloodshed caused by israeli attacks

i think the actual point that the majority of our nation in illetrate they even dont know where their money is going to government is interested in applying taxes and fullfil their duties electricity and gas shortage will remain same
because everyone knows about the character of those who have been elected by our own nation
the electricity and gas crisis across pakistan has taken a serious position
on the other hand gas prices have been raised by average 8 while in few cities unavailability of petrol created immense worry for people
intense reactions riots and torturous demonstration are continued in the industrial and business circles of pakistan against the crisis of electricity and gas
industrialist have given an ultimatum before closing the factories
here there is growing anxiety among those dwelling in karachi because of eight to ten hours electricity load shedding
industrial sector is almost paralyzed
government institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other

farid ahmad
karachi
indians attitude have changed after mumbai attack
jagjeet singh reacted by expressing that he hates pakistan and pakistanis
it should be known that adnan sami has sung with asha bhonsle and how has he become helpless now adnan sami should stay in india there is no need for him to come here
muhammad shamshad alam
karachi on the statement of jagjit singh i would only say that he changes color like a chameleon
who gives statements suitable to situation pakistanis open your eyes that how much you are given worth in india understand the thinking of hindu
after the mumbai incident their hateful statements have increased now they are spitting poison against popular singer adnan sami
after that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards bush president bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself
the second shoe hit the american flag
security personnels dragged the journalist away from there

is this statement of india correct that this violation was a mistake or this was to find out the ability of pakistan air force
not this incident will increase tension between the two countries
