the role of european union for the peace in middle east
looking it from governments point of view the efforts by european union to stop the war in middle east have been decisive
according to brussels official stance the efforts of schwarzenberg delegation or sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard
european union spokesman amadeu altafaj said every single step which may help in delivering the conjoint message of european union to fighting parties is appreciable
officially everything seems fine
but in reality the european union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions
european unions president check repuplics role is already weak
plus internal affairs has made her helpless
on the other hand the french president sarkozy is behaving like if he is still the president of the european union
despite france has expired its 6 months presidential term
sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it
the most ridiculous situation faces the foreign minister of france bernard kouchner
he is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of czech republic schwarzenberg
the problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the middle east war
schwarzenberg says that israel has the right to defend herself while according to kouchner war is not the defense germany has also sent a special ambassador to middle east as long as european union does not show unanimous stand she can not be successful on diplomatic front
the prove is the no lift conduct of israel to mediatory efforts of european union
this is the best time for european union to prove herself as america has failed in middle east due to the policies of george w bush
economic setback suicide of german billionaire industrialist
adolf merckle a resident of sawabia in southern germany left a huge business group behind him
but earlier common german citizens did not know much about him
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the merckle group
marclay group had to bear the loss of hundreds of million euros after it bought the shares of one of known industry folks wigan
then monetary institutions canceled this groups loan amounting 700 million and another 1 billion euro that it necessarily required and hence merkel came into extreme pressure
recently the same banks accepted to provide loan to marclay group on urgent basis but adolf marclay who started as a small industrialist to reach a place where his industrial groups annual income reached 30 billion euros couldnt bear the the loss in his financial strength
after the death of his father when adolf merkel took over his family business he developed it quick putting it on new lines
he named his company ratiopharm which is now germanys most successful and biggest pharmaceutical company
some time back the commercial value of this company was in between 5 and 6 billion euro and still was earning a revenue of 81 billion euro annually after the great success of ratiopharm the merkel group acquired many big businesses which included building materials maker hydelberg cement to modifiedspecial car maker kassbohrer company
the number of employees of the merkel group around the world is near 100000 and its foundation company the pharmaceutical ratiopharm always had special importance
adolf merkel has said many times in his life it has been four generations since i started making medicine
another category of advertisements tends to brag so as to tempt the buyers
after the suicide of adolf merkel the banks have provided approval for temporary loans of 400 million euro for vem group but added the condition that vem should sell off ratiopharm to improve the financial situation for a long term sustainability
after the death of adolf marclay the marclay group will not remain the same as it was before

why reduce exercise with the age
new research
exercise is good for health in any age
this makes your heart stronger decreases cholesterol levels helps in reducing weight helps stop diabetes and decreases the chances of alzheimers
unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age
experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it
according to the american medical association several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise
dr pattricia p leka of maya clinic minnesota says that increase in age is a big reason for being handicapped from exercise and less physical activity
dr patricia teaches medicine at mayo clinic
she headed a research regarding heart diseases and mans ability to do exercise in older age
the team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart
in which the pumping of the blood by the heart its contraction and relaxation was studied
the experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood
they came to know that with increase in age problems increase in the relaxation action of heart
dr patricia says that with increase in age the problems in the heart relaxation rates increases and thus effects the ability to exercise with growing age
dr garvin ken was part of this research
he says that its surprising to see the permanent effects of improper exercise on the heart
some times blood pressure can cause disorders in hearts functions and heart diseases
if doctor and patient cooperate each other then exercise can be beneficial even in old age
a detailed report has been published in the journal of american medical association
no chances of an immediate war with pakistan indian army chief
indian army chief general deepak kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with pakistan how ever we are always ready to defend our country and sacrifice our lives for it
general kapoor blamed that despite of sureties and international pressure in result of mumbai attacks in his words terrorism network is not only present in pakistan but is also active
he said this in srinagar while talking to correspondents
indian army chief is on one day visit to kashmir valley to observe the activities of armed forces on the boundaries
when he was asked to comment about the pakistans rejection of indian proofs about mumbai attacks
general kapoor said that the decisions of peace or war matters are taken by the political leadership
talking about the alleged terrorism network in pakistan he said that indian army will have to face the forces which are objected to destroy peace and weaken india
he said that 700 to 800 militants are present in indian kashmir almost half of them are foreigners
general deepak kapoor said with the betterment of weather attempts of slander may increase from pakistan and her side of kashmir however india has increased vigilance on borders
he refuted the possibility of decrease in the army posting in kashmir saying that there can be no compromise with regards to national security
may god answer the worlds prayers and may barrack obama be beneficial for the world
well there is no hope but see what pakistanamerica relationship brings to us in the result of this change
and what barack obama who is the result of martin luther kings dreams gives to the world
obama part of whose name is husain taking the oath today as the american president is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance but also a historic test
not only for himself but also for all the people who supported him
this will also be a test for white people majority as it is not easy for them to accept heartily the presidency of black on them
here south asia specially muslims who have expectations from them should remember that he has been elected as the president of america and obama should remember that president of america is actually the president of the entire world
after a while a person whose ancestors were slaves and bought from different regions of the world is going to become the 44th president of america
many people have many expectations from this man
people who love him have to have unreal expectations from him
if obama becomes successful in decreasing the religious and racial acrimony it will be a victory for his fans
what will be its effect on south asia and can a meaningful change be expected in the american policy regarding this matter
how will these changes affect pakistaniamerican relations
whether its mr obama or any other throught out the world
as pakistan is concerned the world saw how aggressive behavior was shown by the triangle america india and israel after mumbai attacks
after the creation of pakistan the administration of swat remained with the ruler of swat who had a regular army and law
he handed over administration of swat to pakistan under a pact
but its sad that our governments have treated swat like a step mother
there was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government of the ruler of swat
and neither was the areas development given any notice
presently the girls seeking education went down
the taliban are continuing their attacks on educational institutions in the nwfp
the most schools were destroyed in swat province of which the majority were girls schools
not only this taliban has announced a ban on girls education
thousands of students are being deprived of education
what do you think talibans wants to achieve by stopping women education
why the government has failed to stop these illegal actions
what do you think what government should do
the question should be that what isi and pakistani agencies will get
because swat people has understand the game that army is there to serve taliban not to kill them otherwise how five schools can be destroyed in a single night during curfew how people can be butchered and hanged in the square
when the writ of the government is not being let implemented how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities
now the question is when government has every thing like armed force latest weapons latest technology and spy system then why these taliban cant be controlled
the only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught
the conclusion is that taliban with there deeds making the work easier for world power
15 years ago the war was on in afghanistan
isi had control over taliban which was supported by russia india and iran
then suddenly the situation changed and talibans works came to light
and isi was also offered dollars from america so past friends became enemies
now situation is this that war continues but helping in pakistan are still those iran india and russia
until man realizes what is wrong and what is right he continues to make mistakes
for instance when a thief goes to steal something if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong it is a curse and it will bring punishment and he fears allah that person will not steal
similarly israel should realised that it is a wrong thing to have bloodshed in gaza
greetings
the question is that is war armed resistance and terrorism the solution to problems
if not then what is the specific prescription which takes to the solution of the problems
this extremist path of war does not solve our problems but increases them
palestine afghanistan and iraq should adopt the same model for their development that nelson mandela had used in south africa
to fight more for social ethical and subjective rather than armed
kashmiris participation in election shows that they have accepted this point
israeli attacks are going on gaza from 3 weeks and death toll has reached to 1000
despite worldwide diplomatic efforts to date a ceasefire was not possible
an according to one survey attacks after 27th december has resulted in 90000 palestine leaving there homes and moving towards a safer place
here aid groups have accused israel of being careless about palestinian children and said that a whole generation of palestinian children will be victim of grave psychological and emotional difficulties
what do you say
how is permanent peace possible in gaza

give taliban a chance
basit peshawar
wake up if taliban starts the real jihad who will slaughter innocent people
who will burn down girls schools
and if kidnap for ransom or not get ransom so who will hang people on the pole by called them american spy
these taliban has damaged islam so much that no other nation or religion has done
pashtoon rore
kohat pakistan
if the whole muslim world just give a joint threat to attack israel you will see that how upset will its father america be
and not only talks about real ceasefire rather ceasefire will be accomplished
but what to do our muslim leaders lack the courage greatly
someone tell ahmed nayad to take the first step as he is very popular for his bravery at the bbc forums
the responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on arabs and the muslim world but its and obligation on the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny
this sad incident the worst crime committed by bush
just like in pakistan and india before 30th june or the end of the fiscal year the government institutions are looted the american regime just before its end have given a green signal to israel to do what ever it wants
on one hand america says that it will try for a ceasefire
on the other side the united nation is passing one resolution over another but both have done nothing practically this means that united nation is also working to crush the muslims
all muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the united nations and should establish their own global organisation
many examples are in front of us where only promises and resolutions of america and united nations came forward but only the muslims suffered
what is the advantage of these actions when bbc does not have to print anything
where have all the rules of journalism been buried when blood specifically of muslims is spilled the monster of unbiasedness gets onto bbcs back
by the way is a flag bearer of rights
pubslishing something from their own sounds far they even dint publish the discussions
the difference between you and jews is that they call themselves jews and martyr the muslims and people like you live among muslims by calling themselves muslims to muslims
syja786
for a while bbc forums have been making a certain point sometimes while discussing suicide attacks and other times terrorism in india
the favorite word of these antiislamic discussions was extremism
but who is extremist that you can easily figure out from the above comment
when will our muslims understand that dajjal can not be fought with the sword
after watching israels bombings on unarmed people what would ones tearfilled heart do
but the basic fault is of this turmoil and massacre which by naming jihad we try to blacken the beautiful face of islam
when majority of palestinians accepted the existence of israel then why did hammas need to fire those rockets on israel and made suicide attacks
the conduct of both sides is misanthropist
then we have a view of america and other countries supporting israel
may allah allow the muslim nation to unite amen
and the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism after all they are doing the real work
otherwise is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are
in this situation in easy language it could be denoted as mafiasm
hitting people hard and leave them to cry
medicines for injured and coffins for the dead are being supplied by the arab leaders and asked that
israeli attacks what should happen
this is the actual problem that the leaders of muslim countries including saudi crownprince are in a false sleep neither they have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities
they should take immediate action against israel
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to european countries and america but alas they
salam to all brothers and sisters
i think asking hamas to give up their struggle for the sake of peace is unfair to millions of widows and orphans it is similar to prove them unsuccessful
if the israelites and their supporters are at a rise then soon moses shall be born as this is the law of nature america and israel work as gunpowder amongst suicide bombers in muslims
which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing
abu abdullah pakistan
now hamas and israel should seize fire to stop bloodshed
mohammad sarfaraz paris france
rightly said
suppose hamas is on right path and struggling against cruelty for the sake of gods will they should know that an act of goodness does not remain good if it causes harms to others
those who claim to love god his prophet(pbuh) and their religion to love humanity is part of their belief
consequently after muslims confiscation of everybody on earth is allahs order
najeeburrahman psycho lahore pakian
no not to kill them but rather the order is to invite them to islam
but jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion
to fight them until they stop their plans but this does definitely not mean that you wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd
brothers the fate of the murderer of innocent children is annihilation
but i would like to tell my friends that yesterday the israelis did not have any place for shelter but today they have become so strong that they do not listen to anyone this is because the jews are one
they do not have shia sunni they are all just jews and they have made everything for development
in contrast what is the condition of 55 islamic countries
they are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death
it is essential that all muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against israel
feroz magsi jhang pakistan
and there is no better strategy that recognize israel learn modern education and means of progress and let the world live in peace and harmony
muslims have plenty of land and resources
the need is of proper use
this first most disappointing factor is that hamas and alfateh could not unite
great leaders like yasir arafat and sheikh yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing jihad for the aqsa mosque and this was impossible without removing yasin and arafat from the way
the world is watching how palestine is getting scattered second by second after the death of these two leaders
and how jews second by second strengthening their positions
in 1974 a pakistani prime minister was in such world power that he led all the muslim leaders under one roof with 100 attendance first time in the history
today on his 81st birthday is it hard enough for the nation to promise for unity with each other
but by eliminating the differences between other muslims will accomplish its (establishment of islamic common wealth) incomplete mission
this is a jinn which has entered palestine for half a century
this jin has many mouths
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world
and this jinn other face eating peoples in iraq afghanistan iran and pakistan
this monster is most unhappy with islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through islam muslims the perfect religion of muslim and practical islam as the history tells that islam has put giants like abu jehl on the right path
bombing from israeli fighter planes on gaza has continued since 27th of december
in this attack more than three hundred resident died
now after the air strikes israeli tanks have reached the gaza border completely prepared to launch a land offensive
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council the united nations has demanded israel and the palestinian authorities to ceasefire
however israeli officials claim that they will continue their action in gaza until they are convinced that israel will be safe from rocket attacks
in your opinion is this right for israel to say about this inspection is to protect israel
in this situation is the world organization playing its role
is this situations due to uprising situations in israel
is american newly elected president barak obama after take his position would any improvement in middle east
(kindly note that due to the increase in number of reviews only those typed in urdu will be published

palestine is a holy place for us and its defence is our duty
we should also remember that it was our first qiblah
israel and india have to vanish one day since these countries are made to be broken and god will surely torment these disbelievers sajid sadiq lahore
when has a lonely night passed merely by weeping
when has misfortune departed by praying only (nawabzada nasrullah khan)
bbc searches for such comments and publishes them
after all a neutral impression is to be maintained
though bbc news are often true but the real thing is the delivery
what to highlight and which news is given less importance
etc etc
zaheer chughtai
now in this regard our pakistani print and electronic media specially few urdu newspapers and columnists etc are not behind in the trade who in the coverage or writing of increasing terrorism exaggerate to hell
has said that the united nations which apparently talks of human rights and peace but when it comes to grimness and coercion over muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that hamas should stop the attacks how long this hypocrisy will continue
why are the muslims tortured that much if the american people stop favouring jews then as god said that they would live worst lives so americans u stop favouring them and then see their fate
socalled writers and murderers in name of peace should understand that peace in the world can only and only be obtained through giving justice not through genocides
if any nations can be perished through genocide and results of choice can be obtained then after actions of hitler existence of jews and their uprising was impossible
says a poet
injustice is injustice if it breeds it dies
blood is blood if it bleeds it dries
now who can tell who did terrorism
is this comes in terrorism why because own pain is only felt
other people are not humans or blood of muslims is so cheap or color of these innocents was not red
so why are there no disapproval messages now
i saw bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house can not see the sorrow of mankind and can anyone not see this sorrow alas if muslims would think as one
dead bodies on the road helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood how shall we condemn i can not find words
i feel like crying about the helplessness of muslims that on one side people are dying in india and the whole world is climbing onto pakistan without any proof and saying take action or else we will
and on the other side israel is ruthlessly killing muslims and the whole world is silent this is unbearable
god has light not darkness and when this darkness ends then
danger to israel with america present is a joke
considering elections the rulers should do such activities for peoples support there is no doubt in this specially when countries like israel exist rest talking about barrack obama then history is the witness that no american leader has gone against the policy and nor will do it regime whether black or white is a regime
it appears from the conversation of forum that everyone is grieved over benazir death but as politician her mistakes are not forgotten
it is debatable that benazir died for democracy or for power
if democracy was dearer why did she leave the republic for ten years in the control of musharraf waiting for american clearance and deal
benazir did not come to pakistan when the people needed her the most unfortunately she came to pakistan when she had to deal with cases and was promised a seat of power
there is no one remaining to say about the criticism and accusations of a historical personality
sana khan
some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them
one more reader
sirmadam maybe if you read not only the history of pakistan but of its neighboring four countries or of seven other countries then you might understand the meaning of mr psycho
tariq ayaz
one whose nature is wrong cannot be taught
remain green in water
britain never let them become one and invented the hindumuslim friction which was taken ahead by sir syed
psycho
how merciless is our nation we are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued no one is saying a word
we have progressed enough
sana khan
some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them just like a donkey doesnt become a scholar if you put books on him
although the ongoing talks between pakistan and india were interrupted after the bombay attacks but pakistan and india should continue these meetings
if the talk is about war then there will be many loss of human lives
during the mumbai city attack india said that a letter had been sent by pakistan also when extremists were captured it was found that the this attack was well engineered by four party
first of all merry christmas to mr bhana and all christian friends of the forum
friends of the forum greetings mr psycho a raza sister sana sister shahida akram and all
we do not want the flames of fire but flowers of peace
war itself is a problem
what solution will the war give
today will give fire and blood
will give hunger and exigence
therefore wise humans
its better if wars postphones
in your and our garden
its better that the glim keeps lightened
the indiaamerica relations have deepened and india knows that when the time comes america will openly betray pakistan
this is also the old history of america
because in the case of an indian attack americas goals will also be fulfilled and the expenses will be indias
pakistan should clearly announce that it will not start but if injury is caused there will be no talks of peace or truce and the war will not stop until india is completely destroyed or captured even if it involves our destroying ourselves
this is the islamic history
before this resolution pakistani people and army has delivered their message
indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the mumbai attacks are making it more clever that effected and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has relaxed its pressure now
un has expressed faith on pakistani efforts ignoring the unnecessary lamentation of india and interpols appreciation of pakistani efforts is the side effect of unwanted indian diplomacy
there is no two opinions about this being a very beastly action
but the question is that when thousands of taliban were attacking pir samiullahs town where was the pakistani army and what were they doing
should the army not be taken into account as to what they did there for one year
how many taliban are killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday
and stop this fake operation
the day is not far when in un resolution of army intrusion in pakistan will be approved just like the one against jamat aldawa
first our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and god forbid the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in un
and suppose if this resolution took time to approve then considering the example of america any country will launch the attack at her own
we do not know about the personality and works of pir samiullah
perhaps he was not a revolutionist
as the bodies of comrade che guevara nawab akbar khan bagti dr najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy
they command even after they die
but here an international game is being played here ferrocity and animosity is created to do the ruling
so that license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will clutch the government
in the name of religion activities of these so called islam lovers is highly condemned
america sees the torture of these extremists but instead of being sad on these faithless activities they easily name them as tribal culture
the tradition of the mantel lucrative tribals have said not to take brutal action in the name of islam
in my opinion people of our army are with these people
that is because when they change destination it takes time but to catch them forget about getting there on time even if they are on the spot they leave from there
are they so brave that they keep 5070 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators
they are also servants of allah and so is the army
it is clear that something is sinister
malaiat in the period of the dictator of the time ziaulhaq he did not show good characteristics of sympathies of allah but there is various tortures at the name of religion and more it his writing what will be done after death
and these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power
preachers
you frightened the world form fire of hell
it is surprising when it is said that this can not be a work of a muslim
we are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it
was it the work of hindus and jews the strike on madeena and great karbala
without accepting the facts neither motives can be removed nor these can be corrected
bbc people stop this dual policy
better than this topic the super hit title shoeing of bush fair or unfair
should have been
tahir chowdary japan
please show some modesty a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression and you are concerned about the topic of the box office
for the success of operation sherdil and across the border the success of operation lion heart depends on the favor of people
this act is of american and pakistani agencies and peer sahab is a victim of this conspiracy
all discussions on this forum will now be anti taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined taliban and they are doing what can change the public opinion
i only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day what was the army doing are they only there for targeting the public they even report something like this bombing on taliban residences a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother
did they not know about this mistake
or else having fun
we fold our hands and request them to please for gods sake stop this game
after all there is a ruler above you
though the question raised from the bbc is substandard it could only be felt pity at the poor quality of the writers for instance nobody asked this what were the 3000 soldiers camping at swat doing
the helpers of the army were hanging on poles the dead bodies of those who fought taliban
the green sawati step the pakistani army has 100 media including the bbc the real world and the reality is not a good ignoramus
the pakistani army drama
every child in swat is saying that this is a bloody drama
stop this drama for godsake
these talibans have destroyed the image of muslims
if the real muslims dont accept taliban as muslims then why they get a refuge in thier places
those who become insensitive and people who dont want to work hard take guns and join these groups
have shame
there is no reason for this in any religion or in any families
all media including bbc show different views on taliban and tribals
infact nobody knows the actual situation except us becuase we are the natives
( sorry was pretty hard to translate)
this move has ashamed all the muslims
i salute mqms altaf hussain and the leadership of anp and ppp who speak against this cancer that is taliban
this cancer creates by ziaulhaq he left but also destroy pakistan
but i am hopeful that percent leadership will end this cancer
after mumbai attacks india said that some extremists are behind the attacks
pakistan rejecting the accusations said that it will help india in investigation in every possible way
india said that they have given pakistan a list of the suspected extremists which india wanted
now pakistan has said that included in the list jaishemuhammads molana azhar masood is not in custody and government of pakistan has no information about him
before this president asif ali zardari has denied the impression that western secret agencies and indian government have provided pakistan the proves of mumbai attacks
president zardari said about ajmal qasab that it is not yet proven that he is pakistani
meanwhile prime minister manmohan singh has warned pakistan that its relation with india can not improve unless its land is being used for terrorism
and in latest development indian cricket team has cancelled their tour of pakistan
should these political events affect sports
how do you see the future of pakistan and india relations
neither america will break pakistan nor india
pakistan will be broken by pakistanis themselves
what can you expect after so much internal segregation and rivalry
even jinnah too did not do good towards the muslims of india time has proved this
yasmin chicago
madam if mr jinnahs vision was followed neither the cancer of provincialism sectarianism and mullaism had spread in pakistan nor the muslims in india had undergone such behavior
but it is our fault that we couldnt reproduce a leader of similar stature
if we cant respect our leaders then
this region has great capabilities
god knows when well understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity
both countries have priests shiv sena rss etc that constantly oppose peace
and the evil powers dont want this region to progress therefore these countries are controlled like puppets
can you imagine what status will this region of pakistan india and china will have in the world
pakistan is under the occupation of corrupt and opportunist leadership
may god protect our country pakistan
but sir open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality you will figure out how far american forces have penetrated
other than that national matter are not looking good as well circumstances in sarhad balochistan karachi in sindh are in front of you
in this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation
o allah have mercy on us
i think a last war is the only option
enough is enough
its now or never
this problem will not solve with hypocrisy deceit
and not through small scale terrorism in each others country
afterall even europe was founded after the last world war
and if this great war had not happened then they all would be chattering like pakistan and india
almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be finished
but our military leadership does not seem sincere in this regard on one hand they assure america and europe that they are with them in this war against terror and on the other hand are covertly aiding the taliban
we should think and fix our direction and choose only one way thanks
there is no doubt that the majority of the movement league are from the tayaba group who joined the league after the inception of pakistan
however after that this leagues obstructed aid campaigns and now on indias insistence united nations has declared them as the enemy and even the government of pakistan is cracking down on them
in my opinion it is better if jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities
the terrorist organizations present in pakistan are employing professional criminals in the name of jihad the mentors of these and the mullahs are the same people who called pakistan paleedistan and what not from time to time
now they are trying their best to destroy pakistan
in reality they do not even deserve to be called human beings let alone muslims
without cleaning pakistan of these mischief mongers the national security will remain at risk
can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous or not
there is no place in this world for extremist mullahs whose only purpose is to kill
this news tore my heart
what world is this where it is hard to survive for the one who names an important part of allahs religion islam
non muslim can kill muslim but when the muslim try to take revenge then all non muslim with the whole world brothers together think that the islamic preachings are done with hafiz sayeed
after the mumbai attacks indo
pakistan relations are affected and the recent improvement of relations between two countries is enormously shocked
india has always held the military and nonmilitary groups in pakistan responsible
the up coming problems on the taluk has been stoped
whereas indian security agencies has directly blamed lashkr e taiba for mumbai attacks
in this regard jamat adawa has also been nominated
this was not first time that terrorism cause intense relation in between two countries
in december 2001 after the attacks on indian parliament these two neighbors were on the brink of war
after that in 2002 lashkeretayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists
now jamat adawa to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of lashkr e taiba is demanded to be banned
in your opinion should this group be banned or not
should pakistan do decisive operations against extreme activists on its land
can by banning jamat adawa present india
pak crisis to subside and how important is it for permanent peace between the two countries that armed groups be dismantled
security council of the united nations has banned jamatuddawa after all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly
does the security council always show this type of urgency against the muslims
this we say as accuser is weak and witness is strong
india itself has become a failed government
whose intelligence army and other security officials has become useless who for 72 hours have danced the dance of mole with terrorists and india is cheating the world by blaming pakistan over its uselessness
if one disbeliever dies then the whole world knows about it why is this double accuracy
countries only religious and nonpolitical welfare organization
furqan farooq faisalabad
our prophet (directives for) scholars and all the saints love the people and gave respect to them islam remains a peaceful religion
muslims have also advanced in every field
when this beautiful anarchy climed deen started then momin and pagan fulfill their dreams of violence and the opening new chapter started first aware of the not
do greet them sir but at your own expense
do not do it under the pressure from america
if india is aggrieved it should provide the evidence
why does it not give
why do they blame everything on us
extremist groups are also present in india why dont they put sanctions on them
are we the only terrorist in the world
what about in india
what is israel
the truth is we are the first nuclear muslim state and why this is the main issue
pakistan is now in the last stages
kamran hassan abu dhabi
your words touch the heart and the situation seems so
now even american magazines are publishing new maps of pakistan these sanctions are the part of greater game plan
graduallyusa is making its grip stronger on pakistan
in this situation if wed not become a united nation then history of bangladeshs creation can be repeated
terrorists attack should be condemned whether these are committed in mumbai islamabad or in philistine
terrorists should be uprooted without any discrimination of nationality
the question arises why pakistan and other world is silent on the terror attacks in pakistan killing hundreds of innocent people
if attack on marriott was not act of terror
then why
appreciation for interior advisor rehman malik masha allah he has become very brave
not this according to bbc mrmalik has strongly denied the impression that arrest of terrorists are taking place because of someones instructions
brother subhanallah
whether having the ability or not or to say that i dont want
we the pakistanis are fighting whose war
and why we have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect
no one has the right to interfere in any countrys affairs
we cant notice the reign of good
if people has right view of justice or strengthens on independence respect southern institutions and not help any captain or soldier they there will be definitely peace in pakistan which is not liked by politicians
pakistan is always following european and american purposes
this happens despite the opposition of a majority of the pakistani population
so this promotes more opposition
if america and its allies believe in democracy they should give up their colonial behavior and leave this region
pakistan has ability to arm or disarm
security forces searched a camp of lasharitayba in pakistan administered kashmir
after mumbai attacks pressure is being increased on pakistan to take actions against extreme outfits
india blames that lasharitayba has role in mumbai attacks
he said that the extremists whom attacked mambae used pakistani earth
meanwhile the saying of pashawar commanders is that unknown miltary persons fired the another point of united miltary truks and in result 50 miltary truks destroyed
it is the second attack on neto and american supplies during 48 hours in peshawar
meanwhile pakistani police cracked down a camp of lashkar i taiba a banned outfit already many efforts have been made to disarmed the extremists even money and indemnity was offered
the question is does pakistan want to do it
is pakistan capable for this
what do you say

i have only one question from all humanitarian leaders
if you kill their children and they bring necklace for you this is impossible
knowledge of east and west is there any logic reason or philosophy which allows killing of innocent people including namazi laborers and poor service men in the revenge of american attacks
if your answer is no then you need to correct your point of view
people were armed at that time their was a danger that russia will turn toward pakistan after afghanistan therefore people were armed
now when there is the danger of american attack via afghanistan of which current american president clearly expressed in his presidential campaign then why should we disarm these people
only because america or india army dont have to face any civil resistance after defeating pakistani army
yes if any of them are involved in terrorist activities then only pakistan should take action against them
but this is morn that government against lashkaray taiba that prove right india that pakistan involve in that
najeeb ur rehman psycho lahore
if accept that laskaray taiba involve that still it is wrong to blame pakistani government
and another question is that were these terrorists not supported by an indian governmental or nongovernmental agent
are terrorists only born or prepared in pakistan and not in any other country of the world
as for lashkaretaiba the present terrorism is in no way connected to it
it must be recalled that hafiz saeed was the first militant leader who declared activities of taliban revolt
i am quite sure that taliban agitation is a vital part of american plans so every person or organization must be eliminated who challenges taliban in any aspect
to terminate the expedition started by the american and saudi funding they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society
also protest them that by what ethics american and saudis are spreaded dangerous arms and so called jihadi but in fact the virus of loathsome literature and culture due to which human butcher houses established in our country
after the threat of attack from india announcement of the pakistani army that they will divert their attention to india by removing the army from afghanistan and the announcement of taliban that they will take care of the afghan border america stumbled badly and tried its best that india should attack pakistan
this showed the strength of america in the region
although india did not even threatened nor it has the guts to
the taliban attacked and finished most of the remaining american supplies
this proved that without pakistan military and government of pakistan support america is nothing
karachi business financial center of pakistan is dubai of underdeveloped areas
hundreds of thousands do not return empty handed from here but since the law was enforced on the western borders karachi has taken all the attention
now they waant to kidnap this city
for the first time pathans are called pashtoons they are made to fight by making them strangers to each other although the need is to be united
one solution to the problem is that the urdu speaking learn pushto or the pushto speaking learn urdu or its better that everybody learns english
you must be thinking its a funny suggestion but dont you think the cause of the conflict is also funny
that the cause of clash is language
zaheer chughtai
sir i actually shared this proposal many times in my childhood with my friends which included people from all religious and linguistic groups but these people used to laugh at me
at that time these rhetoric and religious differences were not that live and powerful but they were boiling inside
i can never understand what is happening and why
are these the signs of the judgement day
for what crime are innocent people being killed
the reasons are in front of everybody those who want to break up pakistan are the active ones and those who do such things have neither religion nor country
either karachi or mumbai it is an inside job
every upcoming government gets herself involved in changing the names of places like now a days airport roads buildings all benazir
does benazir mean that which is happening to the public of karachi and pakistan
in accordance with the mumbai attack it is said that the the task in karachi have been failed to perform and now that these job elements should resign
unjustified killing of pashto speaking hard workers and indian threats have awaken sleeping pakistanis from karachi to khyber
all strict applause of anger from political religious sectarian and national bodies is now teaching india the manners of diplomatic speech they have provided american strategists a chance to think again
mqm and anp are responsible for the worse situation in karachi and administration is not neutral
administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately
police and rangers dont take action because of political parties pressure
the talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches the political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man
till the end administration is under political pressure such incidents will increase allah bless pakistan
i think these people are the biggest terrorists
and foreign powers are definitely involved in this but no one knows who they are
but alas that if these incidents were in any city of nwfp then what would the government have done over there but since its not in nwfp the government seems to be helpless
the government should set up an operation here and save a big and important town from terrorism
otherwise pakistan will face a huge financial crisis
bbc urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure and pakistani medias condition is already weak
the whole truth is available on bbc english
one solution to the problem is that either urdu speakers should learn pushto or pushto speaking learn urdu or better if every body learns english
you will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but dont you think the reason for collision is ridiculous
that language is the reason of violence
at last another merciless incident in karachi that was terrifiying every citizen for long
wherever one could do something he did everything reports on the media are 50 of what has happened here in four days
stayed awake in the last four nights and still afraid
who evacuated hotels killed cobblers peanut sellers
the people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of allahs punishment which can catch them anytime
in your opinion what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance
(bbc)
keeping in front of painful mumbai attack of india searching reason for bad peace in karachi is not necessary but it is straight this only happened because the shed of blood
it is obvious that if someone mistreats the father it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control
liaqat ali khan and many devotees also belonged to therefor correcting the misunderstanding of mr psycho i am quoting a verse
we will also repeat our elders traditions
sacrificed for her existence and will sacrifice to save her
faizan tausif siddiqui
it is very disappointing that whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other
mr siddiqui in wikipedia
org is searched for liaqat ali khan you will know that he belonged to a noble punjabi family of an area of punjab karnal
due to his services for muhajirs they consider him their leader
every action has a reaction
one can bear ones self but
ijaz awan
sir before you get a large number of people with proposals i shall tell you that the open signs of this mischief is also found on the walls of karachi in the form of posters and wall chalking
we have been bearing both kinds of misbehaviour
these thugs did not even forgive pakistan and the founder of pakistan they did not face any reaction
they become part of our daily lives
only muslim league (n) was left she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to peoples party
before this mqm and muslim league (q) has already submitted the draft of 18th amendment in assembly and senate
till now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved
this is why nobody has raised voice in the favor of this amendment in senate or assembly and neither forced the house to approve the amendment
it seems that by submitted the draft of 18th amendment these parties has beaten around the bushes means they can claim that we had submitted the amendment but the ruling partys speaker did not proceed
mqm the government muslim league n in the opposition and muslim league q was the party who passed 17th amendment so how is it possible that these parties will be sincere in finishing the 17th amendment
this is what is called getting credit for nothing
peoples party anyway is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment
nobody can think of cutting his own hands
17th amendment will not be canceled until zardari is the president
this was the opinion of the majority in our survey and it is also true
if 17th amendment was to be discarded then zardari would have never become the president
now he is even more powerful that president musharaf as along with being the president he is also the chairman of the peoples party
17th amendment is valid until he is the president
in order to cancel the seventeenth amendment the political parties will first have to dismiss president zardari from the presidency
neither mqm wants this nor other parties
most of the elders in our family belong to labor class
in our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor work we used to pray to allah that please save us from this hard labor work
to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily amroz and asked him what should we do after matriculation so that we dont have to do labor work
editor in reply wrote that we should become doctor or engineer and study these courses
we were inclined towards engineering and in matriculation we studied technical drawing instead of biology
but at the time of admission in fsc my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing fsc in medical
we hardly studied biology for a month before we started studying maths
means that the fear from labor work made me an engineer and now i am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which i am always thankful to god
i remembered this when i was trying to lift the carpet of my old house along with my two young sons
we said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor
the son said that i am studying and will continue studying but i cannot do this work
whatsoever we did that work in three hours and came back home
the point of saying is that if a person picks his destiny whatever is the reason behind it no one can stop him from achieving that destiny
but if you dont even know what you have to do then god be with you
it is said that do not say bad about the dead but what shall we do we see only bad things in benazir even on her first death anniversary
on one side benazir crushed independence movement of sikhs by handing over the list of sikh freedom fighters to india for her own sake and on the other hand provided india an opportunity to fully concentrate in kashmir after crushing the movement in punjab
the greed of benazir and nawaz sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years
during her exile benazir continued to give negative statements on kashmir and atomic program
benazir violated the london agreement with nawaz sharif and made a deal with general musharaf
during her rule benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make as much money that is why he is known as mr ten percent
benazir brother was killed during her reign whose assassins are still safe
besides being a woman herself benazir avoided fighting for womens rights
just like benazir did her politics over her fathers dead body similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body
benazir reigned twice but not only she failed to punish her fathers political murder but could not file a case against them
it has been 37 years since east pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day
it should have been so that we would celebrate this 16th september as a black day and take steps so such a sad incident never takes place again
on this day we could send greeting to the people of bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again
now we look at the reasons why eastern pakistan was separated
they used to make arrangements to bring back the baharis stuck in bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits
we have become so insensitive that if someone dies in our neighborhood we are not even aware of it
we do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish
even after big tragedies we return to our routine life the next day
if only east and west pakistan could become one again like east and west germany became one
we can be one again if we scarifies for each other and get over with our selfishness
but this wish does not seem to be fulfilled in the near future
today when it was announced in the news that the governor of american state illinois was caught on corruption charges
and to remove him from governorship provincial congress is preparing for his rapid accountability our american friend who has a keen interest in pakistani affairs exaggeratedly said to me see this is democracy
in america no gigantic figure is beyond the law
and there is your country whose president was made after he had the corruption charges dropped
my sense of humor rouse and i said whats strange if a governor has been arrested in america in our pakistan prime minister was arrested overnight and once was hanged and second time was exiled
tell me when it happened in america
in pakistan the country law breaker has been departed from president house with guard of honor tell me has it ever happened in america
the chief justice of pakistan was removed in such a manner that despite having public support he could not be replaced until now has this happened in america
in pakistan fake degree holder has become the health minister did this happen in america
after hearing all this the american went down laughing and then conceded defeat
in this picture president zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by americans from all sides
it seems from his smile
he thinks that america is with his government he is forgetting that one year ago they were with pervez musharraf
thus psychotherapy gained popularity
a photo like this was never published in the papers before one president with three american officials
look like that americas work has been increased in pakistan and one and more authorities are working on it or they might not believe that person as compared to the first one
this could also have been arranged keeping in mind the stories of president zardaris breach of commitments
the center offers support services for depression anxietystress learning problemspersonality deficiencies
material problems and workplace issues
it also offers employee assistance programs for corporates
paradiselike swat is also called the switzerland of pakistan
according to the government tactic so far along with force discussions have been going on
but the use of force is achieving nothing other than strengthening the taliban and increase in public sympathies for them
instead of using power government should find out the real causes of the problem
by eliminating the causes fazlullah and taliban will automatically finish
the shariat bill by the anp government will help to address the problem to a great extent
but the government must address the financial problems in addition to the implementation of shariat
from the early steps of general musharaf it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians but the lust of power changed all his plans
hopes of taking actions were lost
when the rule of bush was at an end he was scared and he started dealing with theives
even then general musharraf could have commanded the army but the present government does not even know what is happening

i am astonished how the pakistan army will fight with the indian army while it is unable to control a small group of talibans
could not track down talibans illegally operated fm channel which in my opinion is very easy
but still the fm channel is spreading poison with all vigor
after the girls schools now boys schools are being destroyed
curfew is imposed so that tablibans can move around easily
during curfew tonight eight trucks entered the outskirts of mengorah and formed barriers
the question is that how could they reach there during curfew
the army could kill akbar bugti in his house but salutes the taliban
for god sake someone tells this army to protect helpless people of sawat from taliban and prove that pakistan army can overcome any enemy
he says that most of the blood is spilt in the name of religion tell me that if religion was not then blood wouldnt have spilt
are punjabi pathan white black mahsood and other tribes the result of religion
not at all sir religion preaches us that there is no white black punjabi or muhajir if there is no religion then half of the world would have been destroyed by the war of black and white and remaining half by the war of cast
actually religion nourishes human morally and restricts him that he is not here at his own rather is sent by the creator of universe and he has to live by gods rules
as a muslim i am completely convinced that islam is a complete way of life and the true religion
after moving to london i used to call my relatives back home every single morning although they never called us even once then i realized they were inconvenienced by our calling as well so we stopped
living here in france for two years i also felt the same way
do not know why people expect us to call
resolution about iraq passed in a few hours sending un peace force to darfur is not a problem
immediately criticizing the mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours
and where death is dancing we are doing consensus
o upholders of world peace life is finishing over here
is it really being waited to diminish
so that no more victim can even imagine to use a weapon of mass destruction like catapult to have his due rights
when a father is running carrying his beloved sons dead body even then your hearts dont pinch you with pain
if no then you have no right to be called a human being
but you are a shame to the name of humanity
at least this was proven that this area was also israels country for thousands of years
ideally these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection but since their strings are in the hands of the western and arab countries therefore peace is not possible without their will
and now even iran wants to fight its proxy war from here
even if israeli action has stopped for a while it will start again after some incident
the interest of the owner of bbc is associated with serving america and israel and this is why in the name of enlightenment it has come out with a series of zionist favoring blogs and is doing a biased and blind propaganda
bbc is only carrying the formality and its objective is to have sympathies
i request the moderator that the commentary of applicant should be published to show that bbc still have some respect for facts
thanks
i dont know how this story was imitated but one is sure that dracolla of every age is thirsty of human blood
there were wars and bloodshed in every era of history
but the surprising thing is that this 21st century man who considers himself civilized is quiet over this ruthless open massacre
how can he not realize that whatever is happening is showing the ugliest face of humanity

at this time along with dera ghazi khan in whole country winter rains are goin on
here is a poem according to the weather enjoy the weather along with this poem
these rains are also from you
which when fell brings spring
if it stays then its peace
sometimes comes without a reason
sometimes it spread day and night
sometimes loudly sometimes silently
these rains are also from you
remember any night
a suppressed music
sometimes he put it out
sometimes we burnt ourselves
sometimes every drop carries sorrow
even these rains are from you
all these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase what is it to them whether the country lasts or not
the people should they sell their possessions or be wiping clean the temples with lemon peals
and then our media is also fraudulent like our leaders
its goal is only to extract money from the government and nothing else
and the people are oblivious about this
yesterday noon strange thing happened
all police are running here and there but dont ask about illegal parking
moreover traffic nypd was also not in the mood to look at the illegally parked vehicles
it happened like this that a plane of us air really became a plane and landed in hudson river
till now the only information pulled out was the terrorists were of goose breed
yesterday was perhaps historic cold in new york
the temperature does not fall this much
even my jaws started hurting from my half an hour walk outside
just imagine what would have happened with those who jumped of the plane into the river
a matter of relief as all the people were safe
and sad news is that ship of company sank in this financial crisis
while watching all this i went to new jersey by west side highway i noticed that south bound is blocked still what i did
yes i was jammed in it on my way back
thank god in my one hour trip i was lucky to find one road to 56th street exit
and i didnt see the lines in that exit

humanity is rare in 21st century
today is the age of computer and computers interference is growing in every aspect of life
many people have many reservation over this increasing involvement of computer for example in financial matters
where use of credit card bring ease to life it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life
that just by tracking the record of your credit card you can be exposed
and in future when use of currency will be minimal its utility will increase
in crime world risk is not taken to rob banks now credit card information is stolen
similarly friendship has become computerized
social networking websites like orcet facebook and myspace are ranked first in popularity
but dont you feel that the more closer we are getting of these sites mentally practically moving further away from people
so this way you have been seen your wanted people and their index in the match making website
now can you spend your life with a person like you
i can not and that is why the spouse is called the better half
that heshe may cover my deficiencies
perhaps i received a lesser share of wisdom
i considered true all the talking from any elder
in the same way i was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world
i was even ridiculed a lot on this
but only that seems true which can be possible
its frustratingwhat is the necessity to speak lie
even at this age he was harmed by this
that is why i try to lie as less as possible
dont say lie specially in the name of god
and allah willing say only when there is pray to allah that work completes
remaining allah knows better the state of intention
this is a despicable matter that arose due to distance from religion
according to our religion and the law of pakistan minor should stay with their mother
there expenses are on the father and father can meet them
then when the kids become mature they can decide with whom they want to live
you are right that the actual problem are the relatives who misguide
feudalism has overshadowed our deeds
even here is thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in fathers property so it is resisted although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated
these restrictions have caused social evils even in our marriages
concept of marriage of a divorced or a widow is ending
these absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason family breakups
in our society if the wife of a 5055 year old man or the husband of such a wife passes away why are they not looked at in a nice manner
near us there is a pakistani uncle whose wife passed away 1012 years ago now after marrying off all his children he has married a widow so even his children have gone against him
in my opinion this is religious right what do you say
to take place of our mother in the being of our mother what kind of thinking
i believe that this persons children should have thought what is wrong if he married a widow after he married off all his children
thereby this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house
because his children would certainly be busy in their worldly affairs and would not be having time for him
the reason for this is ignorance
this is the outcome of the social pressure
when the people laugh on such family at such action so the sons denay the second merriage
although we should compete such situation that their fathers doing was according to islam
this is a curse in our society in which we are sunk since last 40 to 50 years
even a wife is agreed on the unethical activities of her husband but does not allow her for second marriage
if she has the potency she will try even after her death
along with husband spoils her afterlife too and causes an increase in corruption in society
chanting islam islam does not mean anything in reality we like only our culture and traditions
like demotivation for the girls education and love marriage etc
the question is that the widow of the house have a abdominal contraction again
in indoppak we embraced islam centuries ago but cant get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then islam
second marriage of man as ridiculous divorce as stigma divorced woman as untouchable love marriage as disgrace and mans marriage with an elder woman as the result of her cunningness is all because of such thinking
moreover to copy the western nations we declare veil and worship backward
accepting islam is easy but leaving this mentality is very tough
allah bless us all the courage for it
amen
writing urdu was never that difficult
centuries passed in writing this little

if people die then murdered

i was coming back to my shop after the isha prayer tonight a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called
i thought that probable this man has lost his way or wants to ask something i stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car
he asked whether i could understand arabic well or not i said no problem tell me what you want
he started telling that he has come from riyadh and here in medina someone picked my pocket kindly help me i said please go away brother since such an incident has already taken place with me that i gave this man 12 riyals so that he could reach riyadh but he started doing the same after moving a little farther
i got really angry and when i told him and threaten him of a cop he vanished from there
this is the situation of muslims now that even for begging we ride our cars along with our families and make at least 2 to 3 thousand a day
however there is a clear hadith (saaw) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one
allah have mercy on us and make us true muslims ( amen)

wife of famous singer adnan sami reached a police station in bombay accusing him of torturing her
the police station advised her to approach the court
saba galadari the wife of adnan sami gave an application against her husband that adnan sami continuously tortures her
and behaves inhumanly
now this has exceeded her tolerance limit therefore a case should be recorded against adnan sami
in place of filing case police asked her to consult the court by saying that this case is not under the jurisdiction of police
in your opinion is the accusation of adnan samis wife on him is correct
can this accusation is an attempt of india to defame adnan sami
let us know about your opinion on this issue
adam sanghar mehr
as far as blames concern so any man can do on other
nothing comes before prestige
whatever be the case between adnan sami and his present wife he had left his honorable life and went to india to earn money now that fame has fallen around his neck
this is the result of his own actions
high ambassadors of america say that president obama will take a strong stand against afghan president hamid karzai
the new american strategy towards afghanistan will focus on war instead of development
officials say that hamid karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achievement of american goals since in his government there is corruption drugs business has increased and taliban are regaining their power
american officials say that people who are putting more pressure on hamid karzai to do more include vice president joe biden and president obamas representative for afhanistan and pakistan richard holbrooke
he said that this policy appeared after president bush who used to video conference with hamid karzai every two weeks left he used to stress upon the american role in rebuilding afghanistan and its civilian institutions
the obama administration will work with provincial political leaders instead of the central government
officials say that they will emphasize hamid karzai on fighting against corruption
hamid karzai is facing fresh elections this year and it is not yet clear whether obama and his group will support karzai for presidency or not
is this statement of the american officials a forecast of change in american policy regarding afghanistan
is hamid karzais era coming to an end
what is your opinion about this
malik babar hussain judah it is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish traditions continue these feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule who would call them muslims

sri lankan team has reached pakistan to play one day series
besides the indopak sullenness a visit by a foreign team to pakistan is very pleasing
on reaching the karachi airport the sirilankan team was given a warm welcome
there will be two one day matches in karachi and one in lahore between pakistan and sirilanka
both teams are claiming assurance regarding bowling batting and fielding
if the sirilankans are proud of their spinners than pakistan has its fast bowlers
srilankan captain mahela jaywardena has said that no one player of pakistan team but whole pakistan team is dangerous
muralidharan and mendis will be the trump cards while pakistans captain says that this competition will be tough
shoaib malik has said that we have played murli dharan and well see mendis as well we have prepared a secret game plan and we shall implement that in the ground
do really paksri series will be entertaining and thrill
who will be dominate the series between pakistan and srilanka
who will win the series
who will be man of the series

all this is done by these people kashmir is fighting for its freedom from past 60 years
no no one asked now they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism so they have started talking about peace and settlement
first they killed muslims brutally now they are trying to resolve issues
anyways pakistan should understand their double policies
asad khan london
india is making situations so that the kashmir situation is overlooked
but pakistan has always shown indias true face to the world
now british government has realized that indian government is maligning pakistan for terrorism so that it can occupy kashmir
and hesitates to talk with pakistan about this
british foreign minister david miliband said that by resolving kashmir issue will end extremism pakistan government will be able to handle the border issues
it should be noted that recently the newly elected american president obama has also expressed similar thoughts on the kashmir issue
the british foreign minister while talking to media in mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president bush
david milliband has said that pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups
due to insistance of major powers to resolve kashmir issue india is creating unrest in the region to distract world from this issue
isnt the terrorism in mumbai a part of this strategy
does india wants to use terrorism as a means to avoid a dialogue
tell us your opinion

i think the big powers do not want to harm pakistan
in fact are thinking of means to control pakistan they know pakistan is an atomic power
want to bring some sort of revolution
foreign countries believe that by cornering pakistan few hurdles may generate want to support pakistan and also wish to achieve their goal

american president george w bush in his last press conference advises newly elected president that he did many mistakes in his tenure and barack obama should do what he think is right
as the president i have taken steps according to the situation and the constitution and under the law given priority to the american interests on my popularity
he said that the enemies of america are still planning to attack america and that the biggest challenge for barack obama would be to stop those attacks
he said that unable to find the weapon of mass destruction from iraq was his major dissapointment and to announce the mission completed in iraq was his big mistake
in the last conference at white house he said that this is my last press conference and i thank to all those who have attended
do you think obama will repeat the same mistakes which bush did
did bush delay accepting his mistake
will obama be able to follow the advice of bush

this is very hurtful incident that israel is publicly massacring the palestinians same situation is here in kashmir but security council do not even bother by it
all the groups that are in kashmir and palestine should keep the war going for freedom and unitedly fight any force that opposes them one day their martyrdom will bear fruit god willing
israeli air attacks are still continued on gaza hundreds of palestinian men women and children have been martyred
important hamas leader nazariyan was killed along with hwife and children
the security council session ended without any decision
america has opposed the censure resolution against israel submitted by lebia and other arab countries in the session
israeli airplanes bombardment is continued since many days on palestinian civil population
the whole world reacted on mumbai attacks but no country including america and england can see bloodshed caused by israeli attacks
why are the major muslim countries quiet
what will you wish to say on this double standard of the world

i remember an interview of adnan sami in which he said that i am not a pakistani my nationality is british
adnan sami should come back to pakistan at the first opportunity because he did not get honor there either
fareed ahmed
karachi
indians attitude have changed after mumbai attack

muhammad shamshad aalam
karachi on the statement of jagjit singh i would only say that he changes color like a chameleon
who gives statements suitable to situation pakistanis open your eyes that how much you are given worth in india understand the thinking of hindu
after the mumbai incident their hateful statements have increased now they are spitting poison against popular singer adnan sami
