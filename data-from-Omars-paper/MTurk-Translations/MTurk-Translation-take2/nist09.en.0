Support of France's Recommendation
The Committee meeting was held in Parliament House on Friday under the direction of Committee Chairman Mushahid Hussain Sayed, wherein it was recommended to the government that, in addition to sending relief supplies, it should also send a parliamentary delegation of the representatives of all political parties to Palestine.
After the meeting, Mushahid Hussain Sayed, while talking to the representative of the media, said the Committee has welcomed France's recommendation that Israel immediately call a ceasefire and permit relief activities for victims in Gaza.
Declaring Israel's attack on Palestinians a crime against humanity, he said that all countries should condemn these attacks.
Targeting his criticism against their double standard, Mushahid Hussain questioned the silence of those who speak out against terrorism about Israel's attacks on Palestinians.
The Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs also criticized the apathetic behavior of Muslim leaders on the problem in Palestine.
He said that the committee is hopeful that the newly elected American president Barack Obama will address the Muslim world during his first 100 days in office so that the gulf between America and the Muslim world can be bridged.
Mushahid Hussain Sayed said that, not only should emergency steps be taken to fill the gap between the Muslim world and the West, but also old problems like those of Kashmir and Palestine should also be solved.
Malik Amad Khan, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, told the Committee that he is going to Saudi Arabia to attend the meeting of foreign ministers for the Organization of Islamic Countries.
This emergency meeting has been called as a result of Israel's attacks on Palestine. He said that the government is aware of the Palestine issue and is in contact with the leaders of other countries about it.
The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the problem of Palestine should be solved according to the resolutions of the United Nations.
Two journalists from Arab countries also participated in the meeting and reported the current situation in Palestine.
Meanwhile, students of the International University in Islamabad held a protest demonstration against Israeli attacks on Palestine.
The demonstrators were holding banners and signs featuring slogans against Israel.
Avoiding Dieting Can Prevent Flu
This finding by American scientists has emerged as a result of experiments performed on rats.
The experiments proved that the ability to combat the flu virus was lower in rats who were kept on a low-calorie diet.
This research has proven wrong the old saying that "while suffering from fever, it is better to abstain from eating."
According to scientists, it is better to eat and drink a lot during a fever.
Researchers from Michigan State University say that rats on a low diet were found to have less ability to fight off infection and an increased chance of mortality, while rats on a normal diet had greater resistance against the flu virus.
According to Professor Elizabeth Gardner, people on a diet will not only succumb quickly to the flu, but will also take longer to recover.
She also says that even people who have taken the flu vaccine should avoid dieting during the winter months.
First Nuclear Test Done in 1990
Thomas Reed, who has worked as a weapon designer in America's Liver National Laboratory, wrote this book in cooperation with Danny Stillman, former Director of Technical Intelligence at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
In the book, entitled "Nuclear Express: The Political History and Spread of the Bomb," both writers have claimed that any country that has made an atomic bomb has either stolen nuclear secrets from another country or has done so with the support of another nuclear power.
During one of the interviews with US News, Thomas Reed said that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb in 1990, during the time of Benazir Bhutto.
He said that his belief that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb is based on several reasons,
including the design of the bomb and information collected from conversations with Chinese scientists.
He said that this is why Pakistan was able to respond in 1998 to India's nuclear test with their own test only two weeks and three days later.
Thomas Reed reminded the interviewer how, when Russia conducted a nuclear test in 1961, America responded with its own test only 17 days later, despite the fact that it had had the bomb for quite some time.
He added that the nuclear bomb, which Pakistan tested in May 1998, was very carefully made and Pakistani scientists had full confidence in it.
When Thomas Reed was asked why China would provide Pakistan with nuclear technology, he responded that it is because India is a common enemy to both Pakistan and China.
He said that there is evidence that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan used the Chinese design, and that this was later verified through documents acquired from Libya.
When asked whether it is common for countries to collaborate in nuclear testing, he gave the example of how America expressly conducted a nuclear test for Britain in 1990 in the Nevada desert.
He said they also speculate that Israel was provided access to the results of this test.
Reed was also asked whether China has plans for continued nuclear expansion.
He responded that China has been providing raw materials, guidelines, and designs for nuclear installation in the Iranian city of Isfahan since 1991,
and has provided Iran with a production plant in Karaj.
He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen through North Korea.
2008: A Great Year for Madonna
The show was based on Madonna's album "Hard Candy" and featured a band of Ukrainian gypsies, or nomads, as well as a duet with Justin Timberlake.
An old racing car was also placed onstage.
It was the most profitable show since that of Celine Dion in 2008, bringing in $236.6 million.
While the Canadian show "Taking Chances" visited twenty-four countries, Madonna went to only seventeen countries as part of her first world tour in the last eight years.
Both singers' shows were directed by Jamie King, who had also organized the Spice Girls' "Reunion" tour.
Madonna broke her own previous record set in 2006.
In 2006, she had earned $193.7 million from the "Confession" concerts.
Pollster declared Bon Jovi to be the third most successful singer, earning $176 million.
Bruce Springsteen came in fourth, earning $166 million, and the Police in fifth, with $120.6 million.
According to Pollster, very few people attended concerts and vocal performances in North America in 2008; only those who were able to buy the expensive tickets.
In America, the average ticket price increased by eight percent, and the highest-priced ticket for Madonna's show sold for $350.
Pollster's editor Gary Bongiovanni said that, taking into account the global economic slump, 2008 proved to be a good year for singers.
He has predicted that 2009 will be a good year for U2 and Springsteen, whose albums are soon to be released.
Co-Education Banned: Taliban
Local Taliban members of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group have distributed a pamphlet in Miranshah, the capital of North Waziristan, and in other tehsils in which a threat has been made against government and semi-government educational institutions where boys and girls are provided with co-education.
The pamphlet states that if co-ed institutions are not shut down by January 5, then action will be taken against them.
It also states that identity cards may not be issued to women for government assistance or any other educational purposes, and women are forbidden to go to the NADRA offices in all tehsils.
This announcement forbidding the issuance of identity cards has been made at a time when approximately 200 women have submitted application forms at the NADRA offices to have their identity cards issued for the Benazir Income Support Program in North Waziristan.
According to the local people, the Taliban's pamphlet was read over the loudspeakers of all mosques in North Waziristan.
Nevertheless, it was not stated in writing whether separate educational institutions for girls will be banned or not.
According to the pamphlet, if any woman is caught trying to get an education from school or her identity card from a NADRA office after this announcement, she and her family will be punished by religious law.
Police in the Bannu District also reported a landmine explosion Sunday on Bannu Miranshah road which killed one pedestrian and injured another.
The injured victim was admitted to the Bannu Civil Hospital.
"Target Killing," More Dead Bodies Recovered
According to the police, on Sunday morning at the Green and Sohrab intersections in the central city of Mingora, two decapitated bodies were found.
The dead persons are said to be connected to the Frontier Corp and the police.
Eyewitnesses say that a letter was also found near the dead bodies in which there was a warning that whoever should pick up the dead bodies before eleven o'clock in the morning would be responsible for his own death.
Local people say that the dead bodies remained in the marketplace until eleven o'clock, but security workers later picked up the dead bodies and took them to the hospital.
During the past few weeks, a dangerous increase in the incidents of target killing has been seen in Mingora and surrounding areas
in which common citizens including women and security workers have been killed.
According to local sources, more than thirty people have been killed in such incidents.
No organization has yet accepted responsibility for these killings.
On Saturday, Muslim Khan, spokesperson of local Taliban members in Swat, told BBC that three dead bodies among those found on Friday were of his associates, including Devlai's Taliban Commander Rafiullah.
Muslim Khan said that Rafiullah was in the custody of security forces for the past month and a half.
He said that local Taliban members issue a notice prior to killing someone; on the other hand, the general public has serious concern over these continued incidents in Mingora.
Local people say that a large number of security forces have been deployed in Mingora, but despite that, there are increasing attacks on civilians.
Bakhtawar's Tribute to Benazir in Song
A rap song (a style of modern music) recorded in Bakhtawar's voice has now even been posted on YouTube.
Benazir Bhutto's pictures and video clips are shown during the five-minute song.
Eighteen-year-old Bakhtawar is a student of Edinburgh University.
She has a deep interest in poetry and singing.
It is said that apparently she started amateur singing after being encouraged by her mother.
While paying tribute to her mother she says, "You were intelligent and beautiful; you did everything in the same style."
About the incident of December 27, she says that she was shot near the temple, leaving us at the age of fifty-four and leaving three children behind.
The entire nation has no hope without her and she is present in all of their heartbeats.
Among Benazir's children, Bakhtawar is second after the twenty-year-old Bilawal Bhutto.
She has been taking an interest in music since the beginning.
It is said that before her mother's return to the country, she had expressed a wish to meet Grammy Award winner music producer and rapper Puff Daddy with the help of her journalist friend in America, but this meeting could not take place.
Several Sindhi newspapers published a translation of Bakhtawar's poetry, but her voice is being heard for the first time through YouTube.
Some of the workers and fans of Benazir Bhutto have started making CDs of Bakhtawar's rap song.
On the other hand, Farhatullah Babar, the spokesperson of Pakistan People's Party, has confirmed that the poetry and voice in the song on YouTube is Bakhtawar's.
On the phone from Islamabad he said that this is a tribute of a grief-stricken daughter to her courageous mother which has also been aired on Pakistan's official television network.
Farhatullah Babar said that the program of distributing the CDs (etc.) of Bakhtawar's song has not yet been planned by his party.
He said that a few months back a fake account of the young Chairman of his party, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, was created on the Facebook website, which was later closed.
Ajmal Kasab is Pakistani: Information Minister
The Federal Minister of Information and Broadcasting, Sherry Rehman, verifying the citizenship of Ajmal Kasab in an SMS message sent to BBC's Urdu Service, only said that further investigations are underway.
Prior to this, Rehman Malik, the Prime Minister's Adviser on Interior Affairs, had denied his Pakistani citizenship.
He said that he had received no record of Ajmal from NADRA, the citizens' record-keeping institution.
With respect to this recent announcement, it could not be determined on what grounds the government of Pakistan, now changing its position, has verified the citizenship of Ajmal Kasab.
However, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior has verified Ajmal Kasab's citizenship.
Prior to this, BBC's Urdu Service and a few other newspapers and TV channels had said that Ajmal Kasab is from the village of Faridkot in the Okara district of the Punjab province.
However, the government continued to deny this.
It is not yet clear whether this Ajmal is from this particular Faridkot or from some other area.
Rocket Fire from Lebanon; also Counter-bombing
Officials of the Israeli army and the police have told media representatives that four rockets were launched at Israel from an area of Lebanon, one of which struck in the town of Nahariya in North Israel, causing two people to suffer minor injuries.
In response to the rockets fired from the area of Lebanon, Israeli artillery bombed Lebanon.
It is not clear whether this was an attack by Hezbollah or if Palestinian groups active in Lebanon are behind it.
The Lebanese government says that it is also trying to find out who is behind these rocket attacks.
BBC's correspondent has declared this to be an extremely dangerous turn in the current crisis in the region.
According to Jeremy Bowen, BBC's Middle East editor, these rocket attacks have intensified the threat of the war spreading.
For the past few days, apprehension has been expressed that the activities in Gaza might spread northward to Israel's border with Lebanon.
Meanwhile, on Wednesday night, Israel's air force launched sixty air raids on the Gaza Strip.
According to the Israeli army, Hamas police offices, tunnels, arsenals, rocket launch pads, and armed forces of Hamas were targeted in these attacks.
In addition to air raids, the Israeli army and navy artillery continued bombing Gaza all night.
Palestinian sources said that a mosque was destroyed in the air raids on Gaza City.
According to unconfirmed reports, Israeli army tanks, with air support from helicopters, have advanced toward the area of Khan Yunis.
In this battle, which has continued for the past twelve days, nearly 700 Palestinians have been killed, including a large number of women and children.
On the other side, 11 soldiers of the Israeli army have also been killed.
Israeli security forces have confirmed that Amos Gilad, a top defense official, is going to Cairo to set the conditions for a ceasefire.
A delegation from Hamas is also leaving for Cairo to have parallel talks with the ambassadors of Egypt.
In addition, Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the Palestinian Authority, will arrive in Cairo on Friday.
My Heart Is Broken; Give Me Back My Kidney
Dr. Richard Batista said that eight years ago he donated his kidney to save the life of his wife Dawnell.
According to the AFP news agency, Dr. Batista says that, in exchange for his donation, his wife rewarded him by betraying him, establishing a relationship with someone else, and has now filed for a divorce.
In an interview with local newspaper Daily News, Dr. Batista said that the alleged love affair created a hole in his heart, which is still there.
According to Dr. Richard Batista's attorney, although Dr. Batista is demanding his kidney back, in reality he wants a cash payment equal to the value of the kidney.
According to his wife, she will present her case before a judge in the next few days.
140-year-old, Nine-kilo Lobster, Freed
"George the Giant Lobster" had been caught in the sea two weeks ago.
The city's seafood company had bought it for one hundred dollars
and started using the lobster's pictures immediately for publicity.
However, "PETA," a group working for animal protection, demanded the release of the lobster and now, as a result, it will be returned to the sea.
George was caught from the sea in Canada, after which it spent ten days in the City Crab and Sea Food Company's tank.
The age of a lobster can be estimated from its weight.
Restaurant manager Keith Valenti says that he had no intention to harm the lobster, and the purpose of keeping it in the tank was to provide something of interest to customers.
Ingrid Newkirk of the PETA animal safety organization says that the restaurant's decision is praiseworthy and an example for those who either want to keep such rare animals in a tank or boil them for eating.
Search for Girl with Help of Mobile Phone
When officials found out about Natalie Maltais, the police officers and fire extinguishing forces of the Massachusetts city of Athol came into action.
Workers found the girl's exact location with the help of the GPS in her mobile phone.
However, with the help of Google Street View, it was determined that the girl was in a hotel.
A week ago, Natalie's grandmother, Rose Maltais had taken Natalie from her legal parents' custody.
Timothy Anderson, Athol's Police Chief, told BBC, "She said she will never return Natalie and then she left the state."
The police established contact with Mrs. Maltais, but when she did not return Natalie as promised, the police decided to search for Natalie by means of her mobile phone.
Since 2005, it is the law in America that the companies providing mobile services will provide the locations of 67 percent of the callers at a distance of 100 meters and 95 percent of the callers at a distance of 300 hundred meters.
Hamid Karzai Visiting India
This is Hamid Karzai's second visit to India in the last five months.
It is hoped that during the meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh he will talk about conditions after the extremist attacks in Mumbai.
During this visit, he wants to express the feelings of Afghanistan and its people about the Mumbai attacks and their solidarity with India.
Besides extremism, there will be discussion regarding mutual trade during Karzai's visit.
There is hope for talks between the two countries about cooperation in dealing with extremism.
During his last visit to India, President Hamid Karzai had said that terrorism will not be allowed to hamper the relations between India and Afghanistan.
He also said that both India and Afghanistan are facing the challenge of terrorism and ruthless and murderous activities.
"Peace and stability is beneficial for everyone - for both countries, the region, and the entire world.
We understand the fact that only by joining forces can the two countries and the entire world fight the curse of terrorism."
In July of last year, Hamid Karzai had held ISI, Pakistan's secret service, responsible for the attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul.
In that attack a high IFS worker along with four Indians had been killed.
During Karzai's visit to India after the attack on the Embassy, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had said that the attack "was an attack on India and Afghanistan's friendship; we agreed that we will not let terrorism hamper our relations."
Mumbai Attacks; Special Judge for Hearing
Mumbai Police Commissioner Hasan Gafoor said that the hearing of the case registered against Ajmal Amir Kasab, the only accused person captured alive during the extremist attacks on Mumbai, will be conducted under the supervision of M. L. Tahiliani.
Ujjwal Nikam was already appointed before this as public prosecutor for the case.
At present Ajmal Kasab is in police custody, and it is hoped that the police will submit a chargesheet against him before January 24.
Ajmal Kasab has no attorney to defend him.
In a letter written to the Pakistani government, Kasab had appealed for legal assistance.
India has delivered to Pakistan the evidence of the involvement of Pakistani extremists in the Mumbai attacks.
Pakistan has accepted that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani citizen.
According to the police case, after killing ATS Chief Hemant Karkare, Additional Police Commissioner Ashok Kamte, and Encounter Specialist Police Inspector Vijay Salaskar, along with six policemen, Ajmal and his accomplice Abu Ismail took their squad car and fled but were caught later in D.B. Marg at Girgaon Chaupati.
Ismail Khan died during the police activity and police captured Ajmal alive.
So far no attorney has been nominated to plead Ajmal's case.
Attorney Dinesh Mota of the Legal Aid Cell, who was nominated by the government, refused to take the case on ethical grounds.
Two attorneys took their names back after the demonstrations and opposition by members of one of the political parties.
"Consitutional Amendment": Committee Will Be Formed
On Tuesday in Islamabad, while talking to media representatives after addressing a seminar on changes in the situation, he said that a meeting of the Parliamentary Party will be called to form the committee in this regard.
He said that up until this point, the Constitutional Amendment Bill for the repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment has been presented in the National Assembly by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, while other political parties will present the Constitutional Amendment Bill in the Parliament.
He said that the Pakistan People's Party has also sent a draft to all political parties for the repeal of the Seventeenth Amendment, and the committee will also examine that draft.
In response to one question, he said that Parliament will be the one to decide how authority will be balanced between the President and the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister said that Parliament has the authority to make all decisions.
Responding to another question, he said that regarding ex-President General (retired) Pervez Musharraf's leaving his post as Army Chief, in addition to the role played by political parties, the role of Benazir Bhutto, ex-Prime Minister and Chairperson of the Pakistan People's Party, was also important, as she urged the global community to urge ex-President Pervez Musharraf to step down.
He said that American Vice President-elect Joe Biden is a supporter of Pakistan and democracy, and as a reward for his services the President of Pakistan has awarded him the Hilal-e-Pakistan.
In a response to a question about the threat by the Indian government to terminate all types of relations with Pakistan after the Mumbai incident, Yousaf Raza Gilani said that the Indian rulers make such statements because they are under intense public pressure at this time.
Protest Against Firing of Journalists
On Tuesday in Islamabad, in front of the Islamabad Press Club, under arrangements by the journalists' organization "RIUJ," journalists and newspaper workers protested and shouted slogans against the owners of mass media and the government for the firing of a great number of employees from TV channels and newspapers.
When speaking to the demonstrators, C. R. Shamsi - senior member of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, the largest organization of journalists - said that the politicians who used to protest with them on the streets are now sitting in the government as rulers, but are doing nothing for the rights of journalists out of fear of a specific group of newspaper owners.
He said that the owners of newspaper who talk about human rights have made their organizations into torture chambers and beggar camps where they pay the workers extremely low wages and financially murder hundreds by firing them, despite earning billions of rupees each year for themselves.
The example before us is that of a worker of private TV Channel Five in Lahore who had committed suicide after not being paid for four months; even today, many workers are living under duress due to forced dismissal and not receiving their salaries for months.
He said that direct steps should be taken against TV and newspaper owners and a permanent protest camp needs to be set up before the Parliament for the rights of journalists.
C. R. Shamsi, criticizing Governor of Punjab Salman Taseer, said that employees are being dismissed from his Urdu newspaper "Aaj Kal" without any notice.
As Daily Jinnah, Daily Khabrein, Channel Five, Business Plus TV, and Aaj TV have fired dozens of employees,
Mazhar Abbas, Secretary General of PUFJ, said, when speaking to demonstrators, that today, throughout the country, journalist organizations are celebrating Black Day against the firing of journalists and newspaper workers, while the journalists will go to the Parliament session to fight for their rights with black bands tied on their arms.
According to Mazhar Abbas, the workers and journalists are being exploited in eighty-five percent of Pakistan's newspapers and TV channels, where they are working without any contract.
He said that until now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been dismissed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is feared that during the current year, owners will dismiss hundreds more, justifying this on the basis of the economic crisis.
Mazhar Abbas said that the journalists' movement will continue until the workers who were fired are reinstated, the Seventh Wage Board Award that fixes the wages of newspaper workers is implemented, and the salaries of workers of TV channels and newspapers are paid, which have been withheld for months.
Eleven-Member Cabinet Took Oath
The new cabinet includes six ministers from the Muslim Conference party which opposed former Prime Minister Sardar Ateeq Ahmed Khan, two from the Pakistan People's Party, two from the People's Muslim League, and one from the Muttahida Qaumi Movement.
There is also one female minister in the eleven-member cabinet from Ateeq's opponents, the Muslim Conference party.
The ruling alliance says that there will be an expansion in the cabinet next week and there is a possibility that a dozen more ministers will be included in the cabinet. In the beginning of this month, Sardar Ateeq Khan's opponents removed him from his position as Prime Minister through a vote of no-confidence, and Sardar Yaqoob Khan was chosen as the new Prime Minister.
Portfolios of these ministers will be announced later.
At the time of taking oath, workers of the People's Party shouted slogans in support of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
3.5 Million Consumers Affected by Virus
This virus, identified for the first time in October 2008, is known by names such as Conficker, Down and Up, and Kido.
Microsoft issued a patch to deal with this virus, but in spite of it, around 3.5 million computers and memory sticks have been affected by it.
The experts say that the number of affected computers could significantly increase.
To deal with it, consumers need to use the MS08-067 patch from Microsoft.
Microsoft says that this virus, affecting hundreds of thousands of computers, locates the '.exe' file of Windows File Services and merges with its code.
The virus then becomes a type of DLL file in the Windows system folder.
It also creates a name for this file,
then changes the details of the windows registry.
After being activated, the virus creates a problem which presents itself as an "HTTP Server" and changes the restore point of the machine.
After this, it downloads files from a hacker's website.
Microsoft says that this virus has affected computers in different countries of the world.
China, Brazil, Russia, India, America and Britain are among these countries.
"Demand for Quick Report on India's Dossier"
When talking to media representatives after a meeting in the Interior Ministry on Saturday, he said that the information provided by India
will help in investigating this matter.
He said that Pakistan is an autonomous country and, in the investigation of the information received from India, from any country,
will not accept any dictation.
He said that, in addition to the information received from India, we are collecting other information as well.
The Adviser on Interior Affairs said that law enforcement agencies have taken into custody 124 members of a banned organization on charges of threatening the peace
and if proof is found against any of them, then further action will be taken, while the innocent will be released.
In response to a question, he said that none of the arrested persons will be extradited to India; rather they will be prosecuted according to Pakistani law.
He said that action against these people has been taken under FIA law.
In response to another question, he said that it has taken the Indian law enforcement agencies 42 days to collect information regarding the persons involved in the Mumbai incident, so he hopes that the international community as well as India will give Pakistan some time to investigate that information.
He repeated the government's offer for a joint inquiry committee to be formed for the investigation of the Mumbai incident.
A three-member inquiry team has already been set up under the leadership of the Additional Director General of the FIA which is
investigating the information provided to Pakistan by India regarding the Mumbai attacks.
Shahid Malik, Pakistan's High Commissioner to India, had a meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari wherein the President made it clear that if any Pakistani individual or group is found to have been involved in the Mumbai attacks, action will be taken against them in accordance with the laws of the country, but no one will be extradited to India, even though the Indian leadership is continuously pressuring Pakistan to hand over to India those involved in the incident.
"Anything Possible in America"
Mr. Obama will take oath on January 20 as America's forty-fourth president.
Speaking at a music concert in Washington while standing on the steps of the building constructed in memory of Abraham Lincoln, America's sixteenth President,
Mr. Obama said that "America is facing the most serious challenge in many generations" and he is hopeful that America will overcome these problems.
Abraham Lincoln abolished the practice of slavery in America.
However, Mr. Obama added that it will take time to solve the problems the country is facing and the way will be difficult.
But despite that, "I am hopeful that the dream of the founders of this country will live on."

Extraordinary steps are being taken for the oath-taking ceremony.
Its organizers think that two million people will attend the celebration.

About two million people are expected to assemble in Washington to watch the historical presidential oath.
On Monday, Barack Obama started his day by visiting a medical center in North Washington where he met with injured American soldiers. Afterwards, he went to a shelter established for homeless people and painted on a wall.
While speaking with correspondents, Barack Obama said, "We cannot sit idle, given the present crisis that we are facing and the difficulties surrounding many people."
He said that Martin Luther King spent serving many people.
Barack Obama said, "Today, as we are honoring his memory, it is not a day to stop and think. It is a day to act."
He said that the celebration on Tuesday will be on the same route where thousands of people gathered in 1963 to listen to Martin Luther King's "I Have a Dream."
In that speech Martin Luther King said that a day will come when people will not be discriminated against because of their color.
BBC's Mathew Price says, "Call it historical irony that Martin Luther Day happens to be twenty-four hours before the first black president in American history will take his oath of office."
For many people in American's southern states, the presidency of Barack Obama will be the realization of Dr. Luther King's dream.

British Hacker's Victory in Court
A forty-two-year-old British citizen has admitted that he hacked the website of the American Army.
Gary suffers from Asperger syndrome. A person suffering from Asperger syndrome has an obsession with doing one type of activity.
His attorneys say that if he is handed over to America, it is feared that he will try to commit suicide.
However, the government attorneys say that there's little danger with respect to Gary's health.
Lord Justice Morris K. and Mr. Justice Simon when declaring the verdict said that Gary is allowed to make an appeal in the British Court.

Gary's mother, Janice Sharp, said that she is happy with the verdict.
Gary's lawyer said, "It is the right verdict."
This case has been going on since 2002, and at last a suitable decision has been reached.
Kashmir: Two Hizb Commanders Killed
Lieutenant Colonel Acharya, spokesperson of the Indian army's northern command posted in Jammu, told BBC, "Based on a confirmed report, 24 men from the Rashtriya Rifles and Jammu Kashmir Police besieged the area in the Batyas forest belt in Tehsil Gandoh of the Doda District where armed extremists were hiding."
They fired at the army and two armed extremists were killed in the counter-offensive.

The other was identified as Sajjad Hussain who, according to the army, had been affiliated with the extremists since last year.
According to Acharya, the operation is still underway in the forest belt because, he says, it is possible there are more extremists present there. The army says that during the first stage of the operation, two Kalashnikov rifles were also recovered.
Yesterday the provincial head of police Kuldip Kumar Khoda, while issuing the 2008 statistics, declared this to be the most peaceful year until now.

More than 350 candidates took part in these elections.
Hizbul Mujahideen has been active in Jammu and Kashmir for the last eighteen years.
For the first time in July 2000, Hizb announced a unilateral cease fire, after which dialogue took place between the Indian government and Hizb commanders.
However, the cease-fire ended within only fifteen days.
Later on numerous high commanders of Hizbul Mujahideen were killed in different operations.
On Thursday, Pakistan's well-known daily newspaper, "The News," wrote about the extremist groups settled in Pakistani-administered Kashmir that Lashkar-e-Tayaba and Hizbul Mujahideen have decided to review their Kashmir policy.
The policy of both organizations until now has been that the Kashmir issue can be resolved through armed resistance.
Dera Bugti: Bomb Blast on Gas Pipeline
According to police officials, an eighteen-inch diameter pipeline running from Loti Gas Field to Pir Koh has been ruptured by the explosion.
This pipeline runs toward the Sui Plant.
Meanwhile, a person by the name of Sarbaz Baloch, presenting himself as the spokesperson of the banned organization, the Baloch Republican Army, has accepted responsibility for the attack on behalf of his organization over the telephone.
This is the fourth gas pipeline, which has been blown up in four days.
On Friday in Dera Allah Yar, an eighteen-inch diameter pipeline was destroyed, repair of which was underway until Sunday morning.
Mushtaq Siddiqui, General Manager of Sui Southern Gas Company in Quetta, has said the gas supply through this pipeline will be opened in the afternoon.
This pipeline comes to Quetta by way of Sibbi.
There has been a severe shortage of gas for the past three days in Quetta, Ziarat, and other surrounding areas, where, on top of the continuous snowfall and temperature which has fallen below the freezing point, heaters and stoves are now no longer working.
In addition, there was a bomb blast from a motorcycle in Mal Mandi in the city of Dera Bugti, but according to police there has been no loss of life due to the blast.
Administrator for Jamaat-ud-Dawa
The Tayaba Center, headquarters for Jamaat-ud-Dawa, is in Mureedkay, about twenty-five kilometers from Lahore.
This Center includes hospitals, schools and student hostels.
Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah Khan says that the appointment of a supervisor in Jamaat-ud-Dawa's Center has taken place so that the work of its welfare organizations will not be hindered.
According to Khalid Waleed, son-in-law of the head of Jamaat-ud-Dawa Hafiz Saeed, high government official Khaqan Babar has been appointed as an administrator for the supervision of hospitals, schools and other welfare organizations located in the Center, while the Center's police staff has also been increased.
The United Nations' Security Council placed a sanction on Jamaat-ud-Dawa, after which Pakistan's federal government has taken action throughout the country against Jamaat-ud-Dawa, and head of Jamaat-ud-Dawa Hafiz Saeed, along with other leaders, has been placed under house arrest. The appointment of an administrator in the Tayaba Center by the Punjab government is another of the actions being taken on behalf of the federal government against Jamaat-ud-Dawa.
Khaqan Babar is from the DMG or District Management Group.
Hafiz Khalid Waleed said that Khusro Pervez Khan, Commissioner of the Lahore Division, came to the Tayaba Center on Sunday along with police and civil administrators and inspected different parts of the Center. Khalid Waleed has condemned the appointment of an administrator in Jamaat-ud-Dawa's Center and said that the number of children in the schools and patients in the hospitals of the Center had already shrunk due to the actions of the government.
According to Jamaat-ud-Dawa's press release, Jamaat's head Hafiz Saeed has written a letter to General Secretary of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon and the Committee for the Taliban in which an appeal has been made to lift the sanction placed on the Jamaat by the Security Council.
In the letter it is stated that the Security Council's unilateral decision for a sanction on the Jamaat-ud-Dawa is unjust and that Jamaat-ud-Dawa has no connection with terrorism, but is busy doing welfare work.
Edhi on Relief Mission to Gaza
He has just now been able to reach Egypt from New York after passing through several stages for acquiring the needed permission to enter Gaza.
When talking to the BBC Urdu Service from Cairo, he said that he has not yet been able to reach Gaza because Egypt and Israel have set up many barriers.
He said, "I have been here for eight days and have not yet received permission to go to Gaza.
I am in Cairo right now and hope that tomorrow I'll get permission to enter Gaza."
Going into more detail, he said, "At first I had only been given a visa to go to Gaza for seven days but later, as I insisted, the Pakistani officials helped me and got it extended to a one-month visa, but on the condition that I go to Gaza only once, making a single entry."
He said that his son and daughters are with him and they want to do relief work in Gaza.
"I have brought some money with me.
I have given a $100,000 check to the Red Cross in Egypt and also gave $10,000 in cash so that they can send relief supplies to Gaza."
Four More Ministers in Cabinet; Sixty-Three Total
The four new federal ministers include two from the Muttahida Qaumi Movement and two from the Fazl-ur-Rehman group of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam.
President Asif Ali Zardari administered the oath to the new ministers.
Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani and the members of the Federal Cabinet were also present in the oath-taking ceremony.
The total number of federal ministers, ministers for state, and advisers, including the four new ministers in the Federal Cabinet, is 63.
The two ministers from MQM are Farooq Sattar and Babar Ghauri, while Azam Swati and Maulana Atta-ur-Rehman are from the Fazl-ur-Rehman group of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam.
The portfolios of these ministers have not yet been announced.
Farooq Sattar is the convener of MQM, while Babar Ghauri is MQM's senator, and his term ends on March 10.
Azam Swati was elected senator as an independent candidate and is among the wealthiest senators.
Maulana Atta-ur-Rehman is a member of the National Assembly and is the younger brother of Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman.
It should be noted that the four advisers holding important positions are not members of the National Assembly.
When twenty-two new ministers and eighteen ministers of state had been included in the Cabinet on November 3, 2008, at that time it was thought that MQM members will also be included in the Cabinet, but due to disagreement about the distribution of ministries, MQM was not included.
Balochistan: Pipeline Exploded
According to police, unidentified individuals ruptured the 18-inch diameter pipeline that runs from different wells in Pir Koh to the Sui gas plant with an explosion in the early morning.
Yesterday, Sui well number 3 was completely destroyed by an explosion, and a gas pipeline near Dera Allah Yar has been damaged by an explosion.
Sarbaaz Baloch, spokesman of the banned organization, the Baloch Republican Army, has accepted responsibility for these blasts on behalf of his organization.
Since the beginning of 2009, there has been an increase in incidents of violence in Balochistan.
To date this month, dozens of gas pipelines have been ruptured, while attacks on trains and people from the province of Punjab have increased.
Although Nawab Aslam Raisani, Chief Minister of Balochistan, has expressed concern over these incidents and issued orders to the police to exchange information with the secret services, preventing these incidents has not yet been possible.
$819 Billion Economic Recovery Package Approved
No member of the Republican Party has voted in favor of President Obama's plan.
The Republican members said that this economic plan is very "expensive" and will not be effective.
In the House of Representatives, 244 votes were cast in favor of this package and 188 against it.
This economic recovery plan is to be presented next week in the Senate where the ruling Democratic Party has a minimal majority.
It is feared that due to the Republican Party's severe opposition, its approval by the Senate will not be easy.
After the approval of the economic recovery plan in the House of Representatives, Barack Obama urged the members not to let political differences get in the way of this important plan.
The president said that this plan, which he hopes will become a law by next month, will prove to be helpful in creating a favorable environment in the country for American commerce to thrive.
Under this plan there will be a bailout in loans of $275 billion for common people and the business community, and $540 billion will be given towards roads, bridges, modernization of 10,000 schools, unemployment allowance, and research of new technologies.
BBC's Washington correspondent Richard Lister said that Barack Obama is determined to put aside political differences and introduce a new political culture, but argument over this economic package has once again created bitterness on political grounds.
Republican Party members in the House of Representatives declared the bill proposed by the government as a waste of government money and said that it will not help in creating new opportunities for employment.
They emphasized the bill proposed by their own party in which more consideration has been given to tax reduction.
They said that through their package, perhaps more opportunities for employment can be created with less investment.
They said that more immediate opportunities for employment can be created by reducing taxes than by a constructive plan.
Bitterness between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, almost screaming, told the Israeli President that the blood of many people has been shed in Gaza, and he was sorry to see that people can applaud the justification for Israel's invasion.
Mr. Erdogan said, "It seems to me that perhaps you are speaking in such a way, even shouting, so as to remove your feeling of guilt, but you have killed people - and I am talking about those children who were killed near the beach."
Shimon Peres said that in Gaza it is Hamas, not Israel, who has established a dangerous dictatorship there.
One BBC correspondent from Davos says that this kind of scene has never been witnessed before at the World Economic Forum.
However, Erdogan said later that he respects the Israeli President and his age, as well, and this was not the reason he shouted at him, but rather because what he was saying was far from true.
Turkey is among the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, although for the past few years there has been tension between them.
"Attacks Not Planned in Pakistan"
When talking to Indian channel "NDTV," Wajid Shamsul Hassan said that Pakistan's investigative report of the Mumbai attacks will be issued soon.
More than 170 people were killed during last November's attacks in Mumbai.
India says that the extremist group Lashkar-e-Tayaba is responsible for the attacks.
India also said that there was a level of Pakistani "government involvement" in the Mumbai attacks.
Relations between the two countries have declined after the Mumbai attacks.
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hassan gave his initial statement regarding Pakistan's investigation, which gives some indication as to what could be in the investigation report.
Wajid Shamsul Hassan said, "So far the investigators have concluded that nothing took place on Pakistani soil.
It could be any other place, with the exception of Britain.
These two places (Pakistan and Britain) were the ones that I was worried about."
India and the international community have put a lot of pressure on Pakistan to take action against those responsible for the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan says it has taken dozens of people into custody in its actions against groups allegedly involved in the Mumbai attacks.
Wajid Shamsul Hassan said, "We are not trying to cover it up.
We believe in taking action based on facts.
Our investigation should meet with the world's approval.
We will try to satisfy India with the results (of the investigation)."
Defending the delay in Pakistan's investigation, he said that collecting, examining, and understanding this kind of material takes time.
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hassan said that India took 45 days to present its dossier.
Black Man Also Elected as Republican Leader
Michael Steele gained victory in the Republican Party's sixth cycle of elections, winning 91 of 168 votes.
In the election for the role as party chairman, competing candidate Katon Dawson received 77 votes, while ex-chairman Duncan withdrew from the competition during the second cycle.
Correspondents say that Michael Steele is considered the most moderate leader among the five candidates who stood for the chairmanship of the Republican Party.
After the victory, Michael Steele said in his speech, "We are going to tell our friends and opponents together to join us, but those who want to get in the way should get ready to back off." Michael Steele is from Maryland, where he has also served as lieutenant governor.
He became famous in 2006 when he ran for a Senatorial seat in the election.
However, after losing in the Senate elections, he was made chairman of the party's political Conservative Committee.
Now that he has been elected as party chairman, the Republican Party's national campaign efforts will be under his guidance.
He has run in the election promising to give new direction to the party and to use new techniques to align conservative supporters with the party.
India Claims that Lashkar-e-Tayaba and Jaish-e-Mohammed Are Present in Jammu
There are reports of militants being present in the Poonch district of Jammu.
According to official sources, upon receiving secret information, the police and army surrounded the area and began conducting searches.
At this time fighting began during which four militants, two soldiers, and one policeman were killed.
According to sources, the most recent reports indicate that fighting is still underway and militants with ties to Lashkar-e-Tayaba and Jaish-e-Mohammed are present in the area, with whom further army reinforcements have been sent to fight.
Meanwhile, Omar Abdullah, the Chief Minister appointed by the coalition government, met with the Governor and gave him official notification of his selection as the leader of the Assembly by his party, the National Conference.
National Conference's supportive party Congress also informed the Governor of its support for Omar Abdullah.
Omar Abdullah will be given the oath as Chief Minister of State tomorrow.
It should be noted that in the recent state elections, National Conference, after winning 28 seats in the 87-member House, has emerged as the largest party. Separatist parties had boycotted the elections.
Congress, which obtained 17 seats, has agreed to form a coalition government with National Conference.
Upon his arrival in Srinagar today, party workers gave Omar Abdullah a warm welcome.
At this point Omar Abdullah says that he will play his role in making negotiations possible between the Indian government and the separatists, but that this will not be possible until elections take place and the new government comes into power.
Role of European Union for Peace in Middle East
When viewed from an official standpoint, the role of the European Union in the conciliatory efforts to stop the war in the Middle East is decisive.
According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg's delegation or Sarkozy's efforts are the equivalent to lending a helping hand.
Amadeu Altafaj, spokesperson for the European Commission, said that every effort by which the European Commission's concerted message can be sent to warring parties is praiseworthy.
As far as its official statement is concerned, everything looks fine.
But in reality the European Union is presenting a sad picture of its own internal tug-of-war.
As Union President, the role of the Czech Republic has already been weak.
On top of that, internal disputes have rendered it helpless.
On the other hand, French President Sarkozy is acting as though he is still performing the presidential duties of the European Union.
Even though France has completed its six-month presidential term.
Sarkozy wants to play a leadership role, and he is certainly capable, but he does not have the permission to do so.
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner is faced with the most ludicrous situation.
He is included in the delegation led by Czech Republic's Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg.
However, both Foreign Ministers are making different statements about the war in the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself, while Kouchner thinks that this war cannot be called one of self-defense. Meanwhile Germany has also sent its own special envoy to the Middle East. Until the European Union demonstrates harmony by taking a united stand, it cannot achieve success on the diplomatic front.
Evidence of this is Israel's conduct, which does not show any respect for Europe's conciliatory efforts.
This is a golden opportunity for the European Union to do something because America has failed in the Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.
Financial Crisis: Billionaire German Industrialist's Suicide
Adolf Merckle of Southern Germany's Swabia area has left a large business group behind,
but until some time ago the average German citizen did not know much about him.
When he had to carry on negotiations for several weeks with the nearly thirty banks who lend money to his industrial group, he became the topic of headlines and began to see the future of the Merckle group as bleak.
The Merckle group was forced to suffer millions of euros in losses due to the financial crisis, after purchasing shares of the German Volkswagen manufacturer.
So when financial institutions refused to make new loans of between 700 million and one billion euros to this group, which they desperately needed, Merckle came under intense pressure.
Just recently the same banks had agreed to provide loans to the Merckle group on an emergency basis, but Adolf Merckle, who had moved from being a small industrialist to the position that his industrial group's annual income was approximately 30 billion euros, could not withstand the deprivation of his strength as a capitalist.
When Adolf Merckle took charge of his family's business after the death of his father, he greatly improved the business very quickly through a process of modernization.
He named his company "Ratiopharm," now the biggest and most successful pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until recently the company was worth between 5 and 6 billion euros, and it still generates an annual income of 8.1 billion euros. After the tremendous success of Ratiopharm, the Merckle group purchased several large institutions, including HeidelbergCement, a manufacturer of construction materials, and Kaessbohrer, a manufacturer of special vehicles.
The number of Merckle Group employees worldwide is nearly 100,000, and the Ratiopharm pharmaceutical company has always held a special place amongst its assets.
In his life Adolf Merckle had said on several occasions, "This is our fourth generation of drug manufacturers.
Now this company's administration is with my children and I am hopeful that in the coming few hundred years it will remain under my family's administration."
After the suicide of Adolf Merckle, banks approved a temporary loan of 400 million euros to his VEM group, but on the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that the group's financial situation can be improved over the long term.
Thus after the death of Adolf Merckle, the Merckle group will not be the same as it used to be.
Crime Rate of Foreigners in Germany
According to recent statistics, between 2004 and 2007 the crime rate of foreigners
decreased from 22.9 percent
to 21.4 percent.
According to Joachim Herrmann, Interior Minister of the Bavarian Province, this only appears to be a positive change.
He said, "It is necessary to keep in mind that the number of foreigners obtaining German citizenship is increasing.
Therefore, when presenting the statistics, this fact should also be made clear that even when the criminal is a German citizen, his background may be foreign.
Herrmann said that in 2010 his province will take this into account when collecting data about criminals.
In addition to Bavaria, thinking is being done along the same lines in the province of Hamburg.
CDU's Senator of Internal Affairs Christoph Ahlhaus said, "When research is conducted in a scientific manner, one cannot draw up the results he would like to see ahead of time; they must depend on the data that emerges from the research.
Ahlhaus directed attention towards an analytical report from the provincial office of crime prevention prepared in 2006 in which the percentage of foreigners' involvement in crime was studied in the Bergedorf borough of the city of Hamburg.
Results showed that here
the rate of crimes committed by foreigners is less than the crime rate for the entire province.
In contrast, when the crime rate amongst adolescents was studied in 2006 in Berlin, it was seen that the rate of adolescents with foreign background was
44.7 percent.
However, other German political parties, such as SPD, the environmentalist party Garbanz, and the left-wing party Linkspartei, are opposed to the idea of determining which German citizens have foreign background when gathering crime data.
Want Quick Evacuation of Troops From Gaza: Olmert
Ehud Olmert urged that for a complete evacuation of troops, an agreement for a permanent and durable cease-fire is essential.
Hamas and Israel announced a cease-fire on Sunday.
Islamic militant organization Hamas said, while announcing a week-long cease-fire, that within one week Israeli forces should leave the Gaza Strip completely, and call off the blockade of the Gaza Strip.
On the other hand, Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh said that in the Gaza War, God has granted victory to Israel.
He said that in the Gaza War, Israel has failed to achieve its objectives.
Prior to this, on Sunday in the Egyptian city Sharm El Sheikh, a meeting of leaders of European and Arab countries was held in which the immediate evacuation of troops from Gaza was demanded of Israel.
In the meeting it was decided that an international aid conference will be held for Gaza very soon.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also attended the aforementioned meeting.
In the three-week war between Israel and Hamas militants, at least 1,300 Palestinians and a total of 13 Israelis including 10 soldiers were killed.
Meanwhile, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has stressed the need to form a united national government in the Palestinian areas.
Al Qaeda's Video Message for Germany
In this thirty-minute video a person wearing a black turban, covering his face and carrying a gun in his hand, is sending a message to the German government.
The man introduces himself with the name Abu Talha and speaks in German.
The video message also has Arabic subtitles.
The Al Qaeda logo appears on the side of the screen, and the video is dated October 2008.
In the message it is stated to the German government that if, by stationing military in such large numbers in Afghanistan, their country means to express its belief that it will not be attacked, what could be more naïve?
The person calling himself Abu Talha did not threaten to attack Germany directly, however.
Currently the number of German troops included in the united NATO army in Afghanistan is approximately 3,500.
Last year, in October, the German Parliament approved a decision to send 1,000 more troops to Afghanistan.
This is the first message received by Germany from Al Qaeda.
Regarding the message, Mikhail Lüders, a distinguished expert on matters of terrorism, says, "The recent suicide attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul is evidence that we should take this very seriously."
For the past few years Al Qaeda has been sending video messages on the internet, and these kinds of messages have been followed by attacks.
On Saturday, the militant Taliban organization claimed responsibility for the suicide attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul.
Most German newspapers and advisors consider this attack to be related to the Al Qaeda message.
"They are making Germany a target."
Fundamentalist Muslims have a negative and critical view of Germany's Afghan policy.
They accuse the German government of adopting biased policies, not only in Afghanistan, but in the Middle East as well.
And for this reason they very much consider Germany to be their target.
In the meantime, the German government says that, even before this video surfaced, German intelligence was already aware of it.
The German Federal Crime Prevention Organization is busy examining this video message.
Obama Takes Office As American President
In this respect it is not only the American public but the whole world that has various expectations from Obama.
Now that Barack Obama is receiving congratulatory messages from all over the world on becoming the American president, the expectations of him are also becoming clear.
In this regard, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed confidence in the new American President.
"I believe that based on the deep friendship and partnership between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America, we can resolve current issues."
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says that Obama seems sober and open-hearted, and this definitely is a good thing.
Even though former American President George W. Bush's policies have faced criticism,
his administration is surely to be commended for the movement to get China to play a more constructive role on an international level, while China has said about the new American President that there will be a need to work towards strong military relations between the two countries.
Chinese political expert Gosoi Wu, active in the German city of Bochum, says,
"In this respect I am sure that in the coming weeks and months Obama and his economic team will apply great pressure, and force the Beijing government to set an exchange rate that is flexible and in accordance with the market for the Chinese currency."
The former American administration has further strengthened the relations with India also.
Where can Obama take these relations? Regarding this, New Delhi's Professor of American Studies Christopher Raj says, "Now we have come closer in a strategic partnership but Obama cannot make any change overnight."
Pope Benedict has also emphasized promoting the atmosphere of peace and cooperation in the world in his message for Obama.
Provincial Elections in Iraq
Since the year 2005, these are the first important elections in this war-torn country.
More than 14,400 candidates are running for 440 seats in the provincial elections.
To maintain conditions of peace and safety during the elections, 800,000 police and soldiers have been stationed in Iraq.
To prevent the danger of an explosion or terrorist attack on such an important day, all of Iraq's borders had already been sealed one day ahead of time, since Friday.
Additionally, airports have been closed and public transport has been prohibited.
According to reports, due to the ban on transport, no traffic can be seen on the roads of Baghdad; instead, Iraqi children can be seen playing soccer.
From the security conditions during the current Iraqi elections, on one hand, it can only be surmised whether, after American troops leave Iraq in the year 2011, local security agencies will be able to take over in the country or not, and on the other hand, political analysts are viewing this as an experiment by which to gauge how much the Iraqi public is willing to bring democratic change to the country.
Provincial elections are being held in Iraq with the help of the United Nations and approximately 800 international advisors are observing the election process.
Day of Ashura: Today the Day of Ashura and the Remembrance of the Great Sacrifice of the Chief of Martyrs, Sir Imam Hussein (Peace Be Upon Him) Was Celebrated with Respect and Veneration throughout Iran
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, in all cities both large and small, including Iran's capital Tehran, the mourning of the Chief of Martyrs, Sir Imam Hussein (peace be upon him), was celebrated with great devotion and veneration. On this occasion, believers participated in memorial services and processions in great numbers and gave condolences to the Honorable Prophet (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) for the martyrdom of his family member (peace be upon him). Today all of Iran is mourning in remembrance of the great sacrifice of the grandson of the Honorable Prophet (may Allah bless him and grant him peace) Sir Imam Hussein (peace be upon him) in the field of Karbala. Believers relived the unparalleled sacrifice of the Chief of Martyrs, Sir Imam Hussein (peace be upon him) in Karbala and participated in memorial services and processions in great numbers.
Israeli Soldiers Retreat from Gaza's Ajleen Neighborhood // Unprecedented Endurance of Palestinian Soldiers
According to the Urdu Service of Mehr News Agency, even on the sixteenth day of the battle between good and evil in Gaza, Israel continues savage bombing on the urban population. Until now 880 people have been killed and 3,700 Palestinians wounded in Israel's air, land, and sea attacks on Gaza.
Casualties included 275 innocent children who went to their deaths as they smiled at the treachery of Arab leaders and the so-called international human rights organizations.
Today Gaza's shroud-wearing militants forced Israeli soldiers to retreat from the Ajleen neighborhood and, taking strength from their faith and spirit of martyrdom, are demonstrating spectacular endurance and stability as they make life difficult for the Zionist enemy.
If it were not for the treachery of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, then Hamas' brave and noble soldiers would have defeated Israel long ago, but in besieging Israel, Egypt has in effect laid siege on Palestinian Muslims, which is the most tragic event in Arab history.
Meanwhile the Saudi Arabian and Jordanian governments are providing political and economic aid to Israel, and siding with Israel by betraying Gaza's unarmed Muslims.
Barack Obama: America Will Adopt New Strategy with Iran
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, America's President-elect Barack Obama said, while speaking with ABC News, that he will adopt a new and updated strategy on the issue of Iran.
Barack Obama said, "Iran will be a very great challenge for the American government."
Barack Obama said that he is concerned about Iran's support of the Palestinian Islamic organizations Hamas and Hezbollah, and Iran's nuclear expansion program.
But instead of continuing with outgoing American President Bush's policy about Iran, he will adopt a different policy regarding relations with Iran.
Barack Obama said, making his intentions perfectly clear, he will place emphasis on mutual respect and the desire to communicate.
Barack Obama has already said in the past that there should be no pre-conditions imposed on the talks with Iran.
During the interview he expressed the hope that his administration will act quickly on this new policy with regard to Iran.
About the crisis in the Middle East, Obama said that he is forming a special team to deal with it
which will begin to work towards efforts for establishing peace in the Middle East after January 20.
President George Bush: America's Incompetent and Hateful President Bush Has Admitted to His Mistakes and Crimes in His Final Press Release
Mehr News Agency has quoted from the Associated Press that in the last press conference of his term, American President George Bush has admitted to many of his mistakes and crimes.
While addressing a press conference in the White House, President Bush said that he has feelings of good will towards the newly elected President Obama, but the biggest challenge for Obama will be to prevent any possible attack on America.
He said that the execution of the mission in Iraq and social security reforms were his mistakes.
President Bush said that whatever he did was for the protection of America.
Regarding continued Israeli aggression in Gaza, in answer to numerous questions, President Bush said that Israel has the right to defend itself. In his view, Hamas does not have the right to defend itself; Hamas should not raise a hand against Israel, and, like America, the world should choke the victim instead of the oppressor.
America's inefficient, incompetent, and hateful President said that Hamas should not even be provided with weapons, even though America is providing Israel with the world's most lethal and destructive weapons. In massacring Palestinians, Israel is benefiting from American weapons. Bush also praised the pro-Israel Arabs and declared them Israel's friends.
Bush expressed embarrassment over some of the crimes committed in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo prisons.
Critics say that charges should be brought against Bush for war crimes and the organizations that perform this task will be doing a great favor to humanity.
President Ahmadi-nejad: Iranian President Has Expressed Disappointment over the Silence of Leaders of Arab Countries
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, Iranian President Dr. Mahmud Ahmadi-nejad, severely criticized Arab leaders' silence over Israel's aggression and its oppression and injustice in the Gaza Strip, and has expressed disappointment.
President Ahmadi-nejad, expressing astonishment at the silence of Arab countries and their leaders over Israel's barbaric activities in Gaza, has said that Israel is enacting a holocaust upon the Palestinian people, making Palestinian children, women, and civilians targets of its barbarianism, and so far Arab leaders have not even issued one statement.
President Ahmadi-nejad has said that all Arab countries should unite against Israel and save the oppressed Muslims of Gaza from Israel's wickedness and its oppression and injustice.
Ahmadi-nejad: King of Saudi Arabia Should Define His Stand on Israel's Genocide in Gaza
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, President Mahmoud Ahmadi-nejad, in his message to Saudi Arabia's sovereign King Abdullah, has said that the calmness of Saudi Arabia's Muslim king over the genocide in Gaza and his silence over the massacre of innocent women and children in Gaza are the reason for the encouragement of the enemies of Islam.
President Ahmadi-nejad said in the message, "You should define your stand and support the oppressed in Gaza so that the efforts of the enemies to create rifts in the Islamic front will fail."
President Ahmadi-nejad has said in his message to the king, "You know that for nineteen days now Israel has set out to commit genocide in Gaza, is massacring innocent children, and is savagely bombing homes, mosques, schools, and hospitals. The Zionist government is savagely slaughtering unarmed Muslims in Gaza. Under these circumstances Israel's determination is increasing because of the silence of leaders like you."
President Ahmadi-nejad said to King Abdullah, "If non-Muslim countries like Venezuela and Bolivia have taken concrete steps against Israel, how much more is to be expected from you."
President Ahmadi-nejad said that Palestinians will be successful in Gaza.
And the oppressed will be granted victory over the oppressor and that this is God's promise.
President George Bush: Terrorism Is Still a Threat for America
Mehr News Agency has quoted from a German news organization that the American President George Bush, addressing his successor Barack Obama and the nation in his farewell speech, said that even though, as compared to seven years ago, America is safe today, the threat of terrorism still hangs over America's head.
Bush said that the terrorist enemies are waiting patiently to attack America, they have a firm resolve to attack America, and America should not be careless about its security.
Ignoring the pain and suffering of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, the American President defended his aggressive and wrongful policies. America's President said that America continues to be the biggest proponent of freedom, although critics don't accept these statements of America's hateful President as reality because America is neither a champion for freedom nor a supporter of human rights; instead, America is the most evil country in the world, not only protecting a bloodthirsty government like that of Israel, but directly involved in its crimes.
Israel is massacring children, women, and civilians, and America's President is condoning this; this is the American freedom and humaneness that the world is observing in Gaza and other areas.
Osama Hamdan: Resistance Will Continue in Palestine
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, Osama Hamdan, a representative of Hamas, while talking with a French news agency in Lebanon, said that a unilateral cease-fire from Israel is against the collective international efforts towards a cease-fire. He said that as long as Israel is present in Gaza, a unilateral cease-fire will be meaningless.
He said that the unilateral cease-fire is a useless attempt by Israel to avoid defeat. Hamdan said that if Israel wants lasting peace then it will have to discontinue the siege and accept Hamas's conditions.
Hamas's leader in Lebanon clarified that if Israel calls for a unilateral cease-fire while its army remains in the Gaza Strip, then opposition will continue against it.

Pakistan: Taliban Have Killed Six People in Pakistan's North Waziristan Tribal Area
Mehr News Agency has quoted from Reuters that in Pakistan's North Waziristan tribal area the Taliban has killed two Afghan citizens and four Pakistanis accused of spying.
According to reports, local people found four dead bodies at the Tehsil Intersection, in the area of Tehsil Mir Ali on Tuesday morning who had been killed by gun shot,
while two dead bodies were found in the capital Miranshah that had been thrown in one area of the market.
Letters written in Urdu were also found with the dead bodies in which it is claimed that the murder victims were spies.
Two weeks ago two Afghan natives accused of spying were also killed in Miranshah, the capital city in North Waziristan.
In the past twelve days, fifteen people accused of spying for America have been killed.
During the past six years more than one hundred people accused of spying have been killed in North and South Waziristan. The Taliban has been accused of being involved in these types of murder cases.
Barack Obama's Signature Expected on Order to Shut Down Guantanamo Bay's Infamous Prison
Mehr News Agency has quoted from sources that the American President will sign the order today for shutting down the infamous Guantanamo Bay prison.
The new American President Barack Hussein Obama has started to take steps toward fulfilling his campaign promises.
Along these lines, President Obama has instructed Iraq to make plans for the departure of American troops, while today the American President will sign the order for shutting down the infamous Guantanamo Bay prison.
It is expected that President Barack Obama may sign the order today under which Guantanamo's prison will close within one year.
In addition, orders are expected to be issued from the White House about revising interrogation techniques with terrorist suspects and there is a possibility of orders being issued against foul-mouthing prisoners.
President Barack Obama started working on fulfilling his election promises on the first day of his presidency and has begun by taking steps toward making the procedures and actions of his government transparent.
Critics say that the American President has started to make efforts to save America's declining credibility on a global level, but it is very difficult for him to succeed because as long as America is prepared to support Israel's bloodthirsty government, it can't be expected to do any good. If America wants to save its credibility in the world, then it should desist from supporting Israel and being an accomplice in its crimes.
Tony Blair: Emphasis on the Need to Include Islamic Organization Hamas in Negotiations
Mehr News Agency has quoted from the British newspaper The Times that Britain's former Prime Minister Tony Blair has stressed the need to include Hamas in the Middle East peace process.
According to the newspaper, Tony Blair said that it is important to find a way to bring Hamas into the Middle East peace process. Blair also strongly criticized the Bush Administration for only talking with Mahmoud Abbas and ignoring Hamas. It should be noted that after estimating the popular support and military strength of Hamas, Western countries are now talking of including it in negotiations, whereas previously they understood Hamas to be a terrorist organization, one that is defending its homeland and striving to free its home from occupation by others, one whose home and homeland a usurper government like Israel has been occupying for sixty years.

Voter registration began this week for the upcoming presidential election in southern Afghanistan.
But the Commission has said that until the security situation better improves, voters will not be able to register themselves in some areas of Helmand Province.
Since last year there has been an increase in violence in these southern areas, where Taliban rebels have increased their attacks on the Afghan and international armies.
Meanwhile, the Afghan and international armies have said that on the night between Wednesday and Thursday, they killed at least 28 militants during skirmishes all over Afghanistan.

Two Missile Attacks in Waziristan, At Least Eighteen People Dead
Pakistani intelligence authorities have said that at least eighteen people have been killed in North Waziristan in two suspected American missile attacks.
According to authorities, American drone planes fired three missiles at a home near the town of Mir Ali in North Waziristan, as a result of which ten people in the home were killed.
According to local authorities, those who were killed included five foreign militants.
This area is considered the foothold for Taliban and Al Qaeda militants.
A few hours after the incident there was a missile attack on South Waziristan as well in which at least eight people were killed.
In spite of the objections by the Pakistani government, there have been nearly thirty missile attacks in Pakistan since the middle of last year.
The recent attacks are the first since President Barack Obama has come into office in America.
The Bush administration had avoided either accepting or denying responsibility for the attacks.
In Pakistan's North Waziristan tribal area on Friday, three missiles were fired by a suspected American spy plane and by which five people have been reported dead so far.
The dead have not been able to be identified.
According to initial reports these missiles were fired at a house in the vicinity of Mir Ali.

North West Frontier Province: Government Rejected Demand for Ban on Girls' Education in Swat
North West Frontier Province authorities have rejected the threat from Taliban militants in Swat to impose a ban on girls' education, saying that this announcement is against both the law and Islam.
On Sunday, Sardar Hussain Babak, the North West Frontier Province's Minister of Education, went on to say that the government will never let such attempts succeed.
He said that "extremists are trying to deprive children in our area of education."
In his words, "These people secretly try to blow up schools and threaten boys and girls."
Acknowledging the atmosphere of fear and terror, he said that the provincial government is well aware of this and wants to make it clear that no force can stop the promotion of education in the land of the Pakhtoons.
One day earlier, under the leadership of Maulana Fazlullah, Taliban militants demanded that a ban be placed on girls' education in Swat's educational institutions starting January 15 and threatened that educational institutions that fail to comply will be destroyed.
In spite of continued army activity in Swat, during the past one and a half years militants have destroyed about 150 educational institutions using explosive materials and arson.
As a result of destroying these educational institutions, girls and boys numbering in the thousands have been deprived of any access to education.
Strict Security Arrangements On Republic Day in India
On Monday the sixtieth Republic Day is being celebrated in India. On this occasion, extremely strict arrangements for security and thousands of soldiers have been posted all over the country.

and also sent a message wishing a speedy recovery to Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who had a heart operation on Saturday.
Yesterday Indian police claimed to have killed two suspected Pakistani militants after a fight on the outskirts of New Delhi.
According to local authorities, the police have recovered AK-47 rifles, grenades, and some documents from these two individuals which indicate that they are Pakistanis.
Police are also investigating whether the two may be linked to the dissolved Pakistani organization Lashkar-e-Tayaba which was involved in the Mumbai attacks last November.
Tea: An Effective Treatment for Breast Cancer
New research has found that drinking three cups of tea daily
decreases the risk of breast cancer in women under 50 years of age by more than a third.
This research conducted in the American state of Florida's Moffitt Cancer Center has found that for women less than 50 years of age, the risk of breast cancer tumors
is decreased by up to 37 percent in those who drink at least three cups of tea daily.
Research has also found that drinking three or more cups of tea daily does not hold any particular benefit in this respect for elderly women.
Experts think that the reason for this is the presence in tea of some ingredients that are more effective against those particular cancerous tumors that most commonly occur in women under fifty years of age.
In Florida state's Moffitt Cancer Center in the city of Tampa, this research was conducted on more than 5,000 women who had been treated for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles to women who did not have breast cancer.
Experts also found that on a special type of cancer, lobular, tea had a significant effect, causing as much as 66 percent decrease.
Almost one in ten breast cancer patients has this type.
This type of cancer is more dangerous because it is deep and is commonly discovered after it has already spread a lot.
Experts say that by regularly drinking at least three cups of tea everyday the risk of breast cancer can be lowered significantly in young women.
They say that including tea as an everyday drink in your everyday routine creates adequate immunity in the body against cancer.
In Britain every year almost 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer.
War in Afghanistan Is the Biggest Military Challenge Facing America: Gates
American Secretary of Defense Robert Gates has said that the war in Afghanistan is the biggest military challenge facing America.
Today Gates was briefing the American Senate and members of the House of Representatives on the strategy of the Obama Administration regarding the war in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Gates told the Senate's Armed Services Committee that war alone is not the solution to the problem of Afghanistan, but he went on to say that there are not enough soldiers present to make many areas safe, a situation which the Taliban takes advantage and exploits.
Why a Decrease in Exercise with Age?
New Research
Exercise is good for the health at every age.
It makes your heart stronger, lowers cholesterol levels, helps in keeping weight low, helps prevent diabetes, and slows down the progress of Alzheimer's or senility.
Unfortunately, in many people the ability to exercise decreases as age increases.
Experts say that exercise keeps our body and mind alert, although age can have an effect on this.
The American Medical Association says that not exercising can lead to several health problems.
Dr. Patricia Pellikka of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says that increased age is a big reason behind an inability to exercise and a decrease in the body's performance.
Doctor Patricia teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.
She headed a study about heart disease and the ability of humans to exercise in old age.
A team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to examine the performance of the heart
in which the heart's pumping of blood, its phases of contraction and relaxation, was observed.
Experts have focused their attention on the left side of the heart, the side which pumps the blood.
They found that an increase in age is accompanied by an increase in problems in the relaxation phase of the heart.
Dr. Patricia says that with increased age the problems in the relaxation phase of the heart become prominent and their effect on the ability to exercise gets worse.
Dr. Garvan Kane was a part of this study.
He says that "we were surprised to see that this thing has a compulsory effect, which explained how much a poor performance in exercise can be related to the relaxation phase of the heart."
Many times blood pressure can become a cause for problems in the functioning of the heart and heart diseases.
If doctor and patient work together to deal with heart problems, they can still benefit from exercise in spite of increasing age.
A detailed report about this has been published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
No Possibility of Immediate War with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief
Indian Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor says that there are no possibilities of immediate war with Pakistan; however, to defend the country and ensure the protection of its interests, we are always ready to make sacrifices.
General Kapoor made the accusation that in spite of international pressure on Pakistan as a result of assurances and the Mumbai attacks - in his words - not only does the specter of terrorism remain intact in the land of Pakistan, it is active.
He made this remark in Sri Nagar while speaking with reporters.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one-day tour of the Valley of Kashmir to examine Kashmir's overall defensive situation, which is under management by New Delhi and the readiness of armed forces on the borders.
He was questioned whether he has any comment about how, according to media reports, Pakistan has rejected the evidence presented from India regarding the Mumbai attacks.
General Kapoor said that decisions regarding matters of war and peace are made by the political leadership.
Allegedly mentioning the specter of terrorism being present in the land of Pakistan, he said that the Indian Army will be competing against those elements that are determined to upset peace and weaken India.
He said that in Indian Kashmir there are up to seven to eight hundred militants, of which approximately fifty percent are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that only with an improvement in weather can infiltration efforts can be increased by Pakistan and the part of Kashmir under its control; however, India has increased vigilance on the borders.
He rejected the possibility of reducing the number of armed forces stationed in Indian-controlled Kashmir, saying that the country's safety cannot be compromised.
May Allah bless what the world is saying and may Barack prove to be a blessing for the world.
Although there is no hope, but still, let's see to what extent Pakistan and America's relations turn in our favor as a result of this change.
What reality would Barack, who is a reality of Martin Luther King's dream, give to the world.
As Obama, whose name also has Hussein as part of it, takes oath as the president of America today, it is in all ways not only an event of historical significance, but also a hard test of history,
not just for his own race, but for all those people who gave their full support.
This will also be a test for the white majority, for which taking a black as their president would not be easy to accept.
Those people here in South Asia, especially Muslims who have attached hopes to him, should remember that he is the president of America, and Obama should remember that America's president is practically the president of the whole world.
Today, a few moments from now, a representative whose racial brethren were brought in shackles from their native lands to America, who strengthened the roots of modern day's most powerful land with their hard work, who suffered racial biases, will become America's 44th president.
Many people have a lot of expectations from this one person.
His supporters have an obligation to not attach unrealistic expectations to this man.
If Obama succeeds in somehow bringing down hatred based on race and religion and other such factors, it would be a victory of his supporters.
How would this change affect South Asia and, in this regard, can some meaningful change be expected in the American policy?
How would this change affect the relations between Pakistan and America?
(BBC)
My dear, be it Obama or anyone else, it is the influential, strong, and the billionaire Jewish lobby that decides the kind of direction that the whole world's policy and relations would take.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, the whole world can see the offensive attitude of India, Israel, and America's triangle about the recent Mumbai blasts.
Local Taliban continues to target educational institutes in Pakistan's North West Frontier province.
Highest number of schools have been destroyed in Swat District, of which the majority were girls' schools.
Not just this, Taliban has also announced a ban on the education of girls in Swat.
Thousands of male and female students are being deprived of education.
What do you think the Taliban are trying to achieve by stopping girls from getting educated?
Why has the government been unsuccessful in putting an end to these lawless acts?
What, in your opinion, should the government do?
For a long time after Pakistan came into being, the responsibility for Swat remained in the hands of the Guardian of Swat, who had his own army and law.
He handed over the administration of Swat to the Pakistani government according to an agreement.
But sadly, our government treated Swat like a step mother.
After the rule of the Guardian of Swat ended, there was no increase in the number of schools at all.
And nobody took interest in the development and progress of the area.
The number of girls acquiring education today is far less than those who went to school in that period.
The question should be, what would ISI and the Pakistani agencies get?
Because, the people of Swat now understand the game, which is that the army is there to serve the Taliban and not to hurt them. Otherwise, how could five schools be blown up in one night during a curfew, or how could people be slaughtered and hung at the main square of the city while the curfew was still on?
If the government is not being allowed to establish its rule in Swat, then how can the government succeed in putting an end to these activities that are against the law?
Now the question is raised that when the government has an army, modern and powerful weapons, modern technology and spying system etc., then why can these four Taliban not be controlled?
The answer to this is that they have the protection of some "secret benefactor," which enables them to neither run out of weapons nor get caught.
The essence of the whole discussion is that the Taliban, because of their own misdeeds, are making the work of the "imperialists of the world" easy.
Fifteen years ago, war was on in Afghanistan.
ISI was controlling the Taliban, while in opposition were the Northern Alliance, who were being helped by Russia, India, and Iran.
Then suddenly the situation changed and the Taliban's bad behavior was exposed.
And ISI also got an offer of dollars from America, which changed the old friends into enemies.
Now the situation is that the war is still on but the countries providing aid in Pakistan are the same - Iran, India, and Russia.
This is the third week of the Israeli raids on Gaza, and the death toll has reach almost a thousand.
Despite international diplomatic efforts, there hasn't been a ceasefire yet.
And according to one estimate, after these attacks, which started on the 27 of December, 90 thousand Palestinians have left their homes to move to safer areas.
Aid agencies have accused Israel of ignoring the issue of the safety of Palestinian children, saying that it is making a whole generation of children suffer from grave psychological and emotional problems.
What do you say?
What should be done?
How is stable peace possible in Gaza?

Unless a person realizes what is right and what is wrong, they continue to err.
For instance, if someone goes to steal and realizes at that moment that "theft is not a good thing and it's a curse, it entails punishment and they are also afraid of God," they would not steal.
Similarly, until Israel realizes that it is wrong and it is killing innocent people and that it will be punished for it, it will recklessly continue shedding the blood of innocents in Gaza.
Greetings!
The question is that is war, an armed movement, and terrorism a solution to problems?
If not, then what is the secret formula that can guide to a solution of these problems?
It's true that war or an armed struggle does not solve any problems; it rather increases them.
In order for Palestine, Afghanistan, and Iraq to be successful in their political process they should follow the same model that Nelson Mandela employed in South Africa.
This means engaging in a struggle that is more political and moral instead of armed, and requires reconciliation.
Participation of the Kashmiris in the election shows that they have accepted this point.
The Taliban should be given an opportunity.
Basit, Peshawar
Wake up. If the Taliban were to conduct real Jihad, who would be left to slaughter innocent people?
Who would set fire to the girls' schools?
And who would kidnap for ransom, or, on not getting the ransom, who would hang people from poles calling them American spies?
These Taliban have done more harm to Islam than any nation or religion has done.

If the whole Islamic world together just threatens Israel that it would be attacked, you will see how Israel's daddy America would feel the pain.
And immediately, not only will the talk of ceasefire follow, but ceasefire will actually take place.
But what can be done; where would our Muslim leaders find such courage?
Someone should suggest to Ahmadi-nejad to take the first step as he is famous for his fearlessness in the BBC forum.
Maintaining peace and taking care of human rights is not just the responsibility of the Arabs or the Muslim world; it is the duty of all the countries to raise their voice against injustice.
This sad incidence is the worst among the sins committed by Bush.
American administration has given a green signal to Israel indicating that it can do whatever it wants, just like looting and plundering is done in government organizations in Pakistan and India when the financial year ends on June 30.
On the one hand, America says that efforts would be made for a ceasefire.
On the other, the United Nations is passing resolution after resolution, but really, both have not done anything. Only one conclusion can be drawn and that is the United Nations is also determined to crush the Muslims.
All Muslim countries should discontinue their membership in the United Nations and lay the foundation for their own international organization.
We have many instances where America and United Nations just made promises and passed resolutions. It was only the Muslims who suffered.
What is the use of pretending if the BBC is not going to publish anything?
What has happened to all the journalistic principles? When innocent blood is shed, especially of a Muslim's, the BBC loudly professes neutrality.
Self-proclaimed bearers of truth!
Forget about commenting themselves, their small-mindedness won't allow them to print comments
from the point of view of Muslims.
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews, and while living amongst you kill you, and while living among Muslims like you, and calling yourself Muslim, to the Muslims.
[syja786]
For a long time, a particular country has been targeted at the BBC forum behind the cover of the suicide attacks or terrorist activities in India. For quite some time, using suicide attacks and terrorism in India as an excuse, a particular faith has been targeted in the BBC forums.
Extremism is the favorite word in these anti-Islam discussions.
But from the discussion above, you can easily guess who the extremist is; in it, writing against Iran has virtually been decreed as blasphemous.
When will our Muslim brethren understand that the sword cannot be used to vanquish tyranny?
Watching Israel bomb unarmed people, is that not a heart-wrenching experience?
Fundamentally, the blame can be placed on this conflict, murder, and destruction which we call Jihad, and thereby besmirch the beautiful name of Islam.
When the majority of Palestinians have accepted the existence of Israel, then why does Hamas attack Israel with rockets or target it with suicide bombers?
The attitudes of both sides are not humanitarian.
Once again we see America and the United Nations supporting the injustices of Israel.
May Allah grant the Muslim global community the will to be united, Amen.
And the real terrorists using these painful acts of terrorism against terrorism should be considered for a Nobel prize as, after all, they are the ones doing the real work.
Otherwise, how is terrorism on such a large scale possible without the backing of some bigwig? And everyone knows who the people pulling these strings are.
So, simply put, this is called gangsterism - do whatever you please.
Hit on the head with full force and then don't even let weep over it. Inflicting all-around abuse and won't let you complain either.
The Arab leaders are giving medicines to the injured, coffins for the dead, and money, and the question is being raised:
what should be done about Israeli attacks?
The actual problem is that the leaders of all Muslim countries, including the Saudi kings, are in a dream world, and neither do they have an army nor a defense plan. They think that by providing aid, they have fulfilled their responsibility.
They should immediately take some practical steps against Israel,
like stopping the supply of petroleum to America and the European countries, however regretfully they
Greetings to all sisters and brothers!
In my opinion, during these difficult times, suggesting that Hamas give up its struggle in the name of peace would be unfair to the thousands of widows and millions of orphans, and would be akin to failing them.
If Israel and its supporters are pretending to be like the Pharaohs, then soon Moses will be born among them because this is the law of Nature. The steps that America and Israel are taking are the propagators of suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these elephants, intoxicated with power, cannot understand.
Abu Abdullah Pakistan
Now Hamas and Israel should make peace so that this bloodshed comes to an end.
Muhammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France.
Absolutely correct.
Let us suppose that Hamas is 100 percent right, and that by conducting Jihad against oppression, it wants to obtain high esteem in the presence of God. Even so, it should at least realize that if good deeds cause the destruction of flourishing communities, then they do not remain a good deeds.
For those who claim to love God, his Prophet, and their religion, the love of humanity is an essential part of their beliefs.
As if subsequent to the coming of Muslims, Allah has ordered all those who follow the Judeo-Christian scriptures to be wiped off the face of the earth.
*Najeeb-ur-Rehman Saiko*, Lahore [P@KI$T@N]
No, the order is not for them to be wiped off; rather they should be invited into Islam.
But Jihad has been ordered against those who scheme against the religion.
These people should be fought until they give up scheming. But this does not at all mean that one should wear a jacket and blow oneself up in a crowd.
Brothers, the end of the murder of innocent children is destruction.
However, I want to suggest to my friends that the same Israelis who yesterday could find no refuge, today have become so strong that they listen to no one because they are united.
They have no such differences as Shia, and Sunnis; they are all just Jews, and they have progressed and have been creative in every field.
In contrast, what is the condition of the 55 Islamic countries?
Lagging behind in every field, and now the situation is that they have become so helpless that the enemy is relentlessly beating them, and they await death.
There is a need for all Muslim countries to unite and together prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan.
There is no better strategy than to accept Israel as a state and to acquire from it the latest knowledge and ways of advancement, and let the world live in peace.
Muslims have a lot of land and resources as well.
There is a need to use them effectively.
The first and foremost distressing aspect is that Hamas and Fatah could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized fashion so that this one brave nation of the region capable of conducting "Jihad" for the Aqsa Mosque, could be weakened, and this was not possible without eliminating Yasin and Arafat.
The world is witnessing how Palestine is gradually falling apart after the demise of these two leaders
and how the Jewish lobby strengthens its stranglehold with every passing moment.
In 1974, there was a Pakistani prime minister who had such global prestige that he, for the first time, brought all Muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance.
Today on his eighty-first birthday, is it so difficult for this nation to pledge that not only would it have unity among its ranks
moreover while working to remove the differences among other Muslims it will work to complete its (the foundation of the Islamic Commonwealth) partially completed mission?
Israeli warplanes have continued their bombing and missile attacks on Gaza since December 27.
So far, more than 300 Palestinian citizens have lost their lives in these attacks.
After the air raids, Israeli tanks and armor-plated vehicles have reached the border of Gaza with full preparation for a land attack.
The United Nations Security Council passed a unanimous resolution at an emergency meeting, calling on Israel and the Palestinian Authority to immediately stop their violent acts.
However, Israeli authorities say that they will continue their actions in Gaza till they are sure that rocket attacks on Israel will cease.
In your opinion, is Israel right in saying that the action it is taking is part of Israeli efforts to defend its sovereignty?
In this situation, is the international community playing its role?
Is this brutal act indirectly linked to the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can some improvement in the state of affairs of the Middle East be expected after the newly elected President Obama takes charge?

This is an evil spirit, which has taken possession of Palestine for half a century.
This evil spirit has many faces.
A number of times this evil spirit has used one of its faces to badmouth itself in order to get relief from the world's pressure and move attention away from itself.
And some of the faces of this evil spirit are devouring men in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan.
And this evil spirit is most fearful of Islam because it knows that whenever it is forced out, it will only happen because of Islam; Muslims and their religion in its complete and practical form. That is because history tells us that Islam brought onto the right track a number of famous ignorants.
Palestine will always be a sacred place for Muslims of the whole world and its protection is our duty.
And we should also remember that it was designated as our first geographical orientation for performing our prayers.
And Israel, India, and America will be destroyed one day because these countries were always meant to disintegrate. God will surely direct his wrath on these infidels. Sajid Sadiq, Lahore.
"When did tears help in spending the night of separation/ When have tears assuaged the night of separation
When was a calamity evaded simply by prayers" (Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan)
BBC looks far and wide to find such comments in order to publish them.
After all, the facade of impartiality has to be maintained too.
Actually, BBC's news is generally correct, but the real thing is the way this news is presented.
Some things are highlighted and certain news items are given less significance,
etc., etc.
Zaheer Chughtai.
In the use of these tricks now, our own Pakistani electronic and print media, especially some Urdu newspapers and columnists etc., are not behind anyone else. In their coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or on writing about these, they bring in their own pet peeves and grudges.
Where is the United Nations, which on the face of it speaks of human rights and peace, but when intense force and injustice is inflicted on Muslims, it just repeats the same thing, that Hamas should stop its attacks? Till when will this inconsistent policy continue?
Why such oppression of Muslims? If people like America stop backing the Jews, Allah has clearly said that this nation would spend the life of a disgraced nation, and this nation can never live normally. So, Americans, if you have the guts, stop supporting them and then see their fate.
The so-called arbiters of the world, and those who kill and destroy others in the name of peace, should clearly understand that peace can only be established in the world by being just, and not by being unfair and through genocide.
If genocide was a sure way to eliminate a whole race and have one's way, not only would the Jews have not existed after the steps that Hitler took, but their rise today would have been impossible.
As a poet says,
"Cruelty is cruelty after all, it inflates, then it dissipates
Blood is blood after all, it drips, then it coagulates."
Now who will explain to whom the meaning of terrorism?
Does everyone not come under the category of terrorism? Why does everyone only feel their own pain?
Are other people not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has now become so cheap? Wasn't the blood of so many innocents red?
And now why doesn't a condolence message come from anywhere anymore?
I watched the Mumbai attack operations as if my own house was on fire. It is not easy to watch human suffering and this suffering is not visible to anyone? I wish Muslims could unite, and then think.
How to protest the corpses lying on the road, unattended injured, and innocent faces soaked in blood; cannot find words.
Feel like crying over the helplessness of Muslims. On the one hand, whenever people are killed in India, the whole world starts blaming Pakistan without any proof, asking it to take action, otherwise they will take the initiative.
On the other, Israel is openly conducting genocide of the Muslims, and the world is silent. This is unbearable.
God acts on his own timetable, and when he does, to end this lawlessness-
While America exists, a threat to Israel's existence should be considered a joke.
As far as the elections are concerned, those in power will take such measures as to please the people, and without a doubt especially a state like Israel. As far as Barack Obama is concerned, history is a witness that no American president to date has gone against the ruling policy, and this will not even happen. An imperialist, whether black or white, is an imperialist.
The ongoing debate in the forum shows that everyone is sad about Benazir's demise. However, considering her as a politician, her failings have not been ignored.
It is being debated whether Benazir gave away her life for democracy or to gain power.
If democracy was dear to her, then why was she free for ten years until a deal was made to obtain American clearance under Musharraf's authoritarian rule?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the people subject to authoritarianism needed her. Unfortunately, she came to Pakistan after being acquitted in law suits and when she was assured of her power.
There is no one to respond to the blame and criticism constantly being leveled at a historical figure.
Sana Khan.
Some things are just ignored because one feels that nothing can be done about them.
Another reciter.
Dear Sir/Madam, Perhaps you did not just read the history of (Sir) in Pakistan, but also in four friendly countries and seven other countries. Perhaps you agree with Mr. Saiko.
Tariq Ayaz.
Those who are not talented will not benefit from training.
The image of cypress trees did not appear green in the water.
Britain never allowed them to unite and concocted a Hindu-Muslim feud, which was nurtured by Sir Syed.
Saiko.
How cruel are our people; blindly writing odes to celebrate themselves and their party, and no one to defend the historical figures and intellectuals who are being accused and criticized willy-nilly.
We have made entirely too much progress.
Sana Khan.
Some things are just ignored, thinking that nothing can be done about them, like loading books on a donkey does not turn it into a scholar.
Even if the ongoing dialogue between Pakistan and India has been disturbed after the Mumbai attacks, both countries should continue the dialogue.
If they think of going to war, then both sides will lose human lives.
India says that the person they arrested for the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani national and he had also sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. However, it is significant to note that initially, when Indian authorities arrested this extremist, they claimed that he was an accomplished engineer, but later they said that his education was only at the fourth grade level, something to be determined.
First of all, Merry Christmas to Mr. Bahana and all the Christian friends of the forum.
Forum friends: Mr. Saiko, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shaihda Akram and everyone, greetings.
We do not want the flames of war, rather the flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
What problems will war solve?
Today it will result in fire and blood.
Tomorrow it will result in hunger and depravation.
This is why, thoughtful people,
it is better if we keep war at bay,
in your yard and ours.
It's better if we light a candle.
America's relations with India have become quite strong, and India surely knows that if the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
This is also evident from American history.
And in the case of an Indian attack, America will achieve its goals while India will foot the bill.
Pakistan should make it clear that we would not initiate war, but if an invasion takes place, then discussion of treaty, peace, and ceasefire will not take place until India is completely destroyed or occupied, even if this means our own destruction.
This is Islamic history.
Even before this resolution came to pass, the Pakistani people and army have conveyed whatever message they wanted to.
India's efforts to gain undue diplomatic and military advantage as a compensation for the Mumbai attacks have made it appear to be a clever, rather than effective, party. This is why, after the initial strong international reaction, now the world has reduced its pressure on Pakistan.
Ignoring the needless fuss created by India, the United Nations expression of satisfaction over Pakistan's efforts and Interpol's President's commendation of Pakistani efforts are the fallout of India's diplomatic efforts, rather than its need.
There is no disagreement that this act is an extremely corrupt act.
But the question is, when thousands of Taliban attacked the village of Peer Samiullah, where was the Pakistani army, and what was it doing?
Should the army not be held accountable for whatever it did out there in a whole year?
How many Taliban are being killed by the thousands of mortars and bombs that they drop everyday?
I appeal to ISI that they should stop patronizing the Taliban and let us live in peace in the heavenly Swat,
and put an end to this fake operation.
The day is not far away when a United Nations resolution relating to armed intervention in Pakistan will pass just like the way one was passed against Jamat-ud-Daawa.
Riaz Ahmed Faruqi.
To begin with, our extremists and their supporters themselves are constantly providing proofs and reasons for action against themselves, and whenever such a resolution is passed, there is a great possibility that no one will raise their voice at the United Nations in support of us.
And even if there is some delay in the passing of the resolution, one country or another will follow the example of America and attack us on their own.
We do not have much familiarity with the personality and achievements of Peer Samiullah and we do not have information about what his activities were.
Probably he was not a revolutionary.
The way Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, Dr. Najibullah, and the bodies of thousands of dead revolutionaries have been desecrated at the hands of the enemies.
They are immortal even after death.
But here, an international game is being played. Here, people are being ruled by fear, inculcated through barbarism and bestiality.
This is to justify their rule; that is, if they do not rule then such barbarians and beasts will rule.
This act, which has been performed by Islamists in the name of religion, is highly condemnable.
The supporters of these extremists can see the tyranny of America, but instead of feeling sorry about such acts, they excuse them by labeling them as tribal customs.
No sensitive person can cover such a brutal act in the name of tribal customs, or in the name of religion.
I think people from our armed forces are in cahoots with them.
When these people move from one place to another, it takes some time, during which they can be captured. But the army leaves the place, even if it's there, let alone capturing them during their movement.
Are those people so fearless that they keep 50 to 70 people as hostages and our army watches the show?
They are creatures of Allah, and so is our army.
It's clear that there is something fishy going on.
The great dictator of his time, Zia-ul-Haq, due to his authoritarianism, instead of highlighting the compassionate and merciful attributes of God, created an atmosphere of fear and terror for the faith through the discussions of the variety of forms of God's wrath and punishments. The incidence of the hanging corpse and books titled "What Will Happen After Death" produce fear and terror.
And these people are using fear and terror as the tools for obtaining worldly profits, gains, and grandeur.
Waazu!
You are the one who planted the fear of hell fire among all.
You became the face of fear itself.
It's amazing when it is said that this cannot be the work of a Muslim.
We are ignorant of our own history, or we intentionally do not want to face it?
After the demise of the Prophet, due to the refusal to take the oath of allegiance, the door to his daughter's house was set fire, and who put a noose around her husband's neck, and dragged him around?
Were they outsiders?
Was the attack of the army of Yazeed on Madina, or the incidence of Karbala the work of the Hindus or the Jews?
Without accepting the truth, the motives have neither been understood, nor have they been addressed.
BBC, end your two-faced policy!
A better topic than this: "Was it appropriate to hit Bush with shoes or not?"
"Should it have happened?"
Tahir Chaudhry, Japan.
Friend, show some shame. A man was dug out of a grave and hanged on a pole because he raised his voice against injustice, and all you can think of is the topic of the box office.
For Operation Lionheart's success, and its success on the other side of the border depends on which side the common people are inclined to support.
This is the work of American and Pakistani agencies and friend Peer has been a victim of their scheme.
All the comments made in this forum now will be against the Taliban, because secret agents have successfully infiltrated the ranks of the Taliban and are taking steps to change public opinion.
What I would like to ask is that while this dead body was hanging there for a whole day, what were the soldiers doing there? Do they only sit there to target civilians? And then the way they issue a statement like this - "Taliban hideouts attacked, a mother and her three kids killed when the house was bombed."
Did they not know about this square?
Or were they watching the show?
We plead and beg for God's sake, put an end to this game.
Lest you forget there is also someone who is watching over you.
A question was put forth by BBC whether appropriate or not, but the superficiality of it was disheartening. For instance, no one asked the question as to what the 30,000 armed troops in Swat have gone there to accomplish.
The corpses of those who fight the Taliban and support the army dangle all day long from the poles.
Whatever was done to the people of Swat by the cursed Pakistani army they did. But the media, including the BBC, did not do any good by hiding the truth from the world.
The Pakistani army is staging a play.
Every child of Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake, end the drama.
These Taliban have given Muslims a bad name.
If true Muslims in the whole world do not consider them Muslims, then why do these terrorists find refuge in their own area?
Those who have become shameless, who do not want to work hard, get guns and join their groups.
Islam did not come about by force using a gun or a sword.
You should be ashamed.
The answer to this cannot be found in any religion or any family tradition.
The whole media, including the BBC, is speculating about the Taliban and the tribes using different sources.
But nobody knows what the actual situation is. We know, because we ourselves are tribesmen.
In short, this is a game in which the CIA, RAW, Mosad, and our own ISI are involved. There are no Taliban or tribesmen; there are terrorist who have been created to give a bad name to Islam, Taliban, Madrasahs, Pashtun people, tribes and the tribal customs.
This behavior has brought shame to the Muslims.
I salute MQM's chief Altaf Husain, ANP, and PPP, who are speaking up about this cancer. i.e. the Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq. He died, but ruined Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that the present leadership will eliminate this cancer.
India, after the Mumbai attacks, has declared that a few extremist elements from Pakistan were involved in them.
Pakistan has refuted these allegations, saying that it will provide as much help to India in the investigations as it can.
India has stated that it has given a list of twenty suspected terrorists to Pakistan who are wanted by India.
Now Pakistan has said that Jaish-e-Mohammad's leader Maulana Masood Azhar, who is also included in this list, has not been detained and the Pakistani government has no information about him.
Earlier, Pakistan's president Asif Ali Zardari dismissed the impression that western secret service agencies and the Indian government have provided proofs about the Mumbai attacks to Pakistan.
President Zardari said that whether Ajmal Kasab is from Pakistan or not hasn't been proved yet.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned Pakistan that its relations with India cannot improve while it keeps using India's land for terrorist activities.
And in the recent developments, the Indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to Pakistan.
Should these political events affect sports?
How do you see the future of the relations between Pakistan and India?
Pakistan would be broken neither by America, nor by India.
Pakistanis themselves would break Pakistan.
What do you expect after so much provincialism and sectarianism?
Time has also proved that Jinnah did not do any good to the Muslims of India.
Yasmin, Chicago.
Madam, had work continued on the vision of Mr. Jinnah, neither the cancer of provincialism, nor sectarianism would have spread in Pakistan, and India would not have treated Muslims like this.
But the fault lies with us that we could not create a leader like him.
If we cannot value our heroes than
This region does have a lot of talent.
God knows when they will get smart and when this region will prosper with the blessing of unity.
In both countries, mullahs, pundits, Taliban, Shiv Sena, RSS, etc. have been mobilized to oppose peace.
And the forces of tyranny do not want this region to prosper with peace, so they make these countries dance to their tune.
Can you imagine what position this region would occupy in the world if Pakistan, India, and China were to come to an agreement?
The curse of God has fallen on Pakistan as thieves, plunderers, and blackmailers have been imposed on the country as leaders.
May Allah always keep our country Pakistan safe. Amen.
But Sir, open your eyes and look around at the ground realities, and you will realize to what point the American forces have reached!
Apart from this, the national situation also does not look right. The situation in NWFP, Balochistan, and Karachi in Sindh is right in front of you.
In such circumstances, the country needs a leader who can unite us as a nation.
Oh Allah, have mercy on us.
I think there is no option but a final war.
Enough is enough.
It should go this way or the other.
These hypocritical pretensions of having a dialog will not solve any problem.
Neither will small acts of terrorism in each other's countries.
After all, Europe only calmed down after the last World War.
Had this great war not taken place, they would have been bickering like Pakistan and India do till today.
India, as a consequence of the Mumbai attacks,
tension has resulted in relations with Pakistan and the current improvement in the relations between both the countries gained over the years has been setback.
India has constantly held the militant and non-militant groups in Pakistan accountable.
The return of the relations to normality is being attributed to the action that was taken against these groups.
Meanwhile, Indian security organizations have directly accused Lashkar-e-Tayaba for being the perpetrator of the Mumbai attacks.
In relation to this, Jamiat-ud-Daawa's name is also being brought up again and again.
This is not the first time that the relations between both countries have been strained by some terrorist activity in India.
In December 2001, after the attack on the Indian parliament, both countries had come to the brink of a war.
Following this, in 2002, Lashkar-e-Tayaba was banned and its name was added to the list of terrorist groups.
Now there is a demand to ban Jamiat-ud-Daawa, which, according to security analysts, is the new face of Lashkar-e-Tayaba.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan carry out a decisive operation against the hot-headed extremist groups that are active on its land?
Can the banning of Jamiat-ud-Dawa and the current India-
Pak crisis be evaded, and how important is it for armed groups to be abolished for stable peace between the two nations?
Almost all of our political parties agree that terrorism and sectarianism should end in the country.
But our armed forces leadership does not seem sincere about this. On the one hand, America and Europe are assured that we are with them in this war against terrorism. On the other, the Taliban are also secretly provided with help.
Now we have to think and make a decision about our direction and choose only one way. Thanks.
There is no doubt that a majority of the active members of Lashkar-e-Tayaba joined Jamiat-ud-Daawa after Lashkar-e-Tayaba was banned.
After that these activists gave priority to providing aid, and on the strong insistence of India, the United Nations has banned it, too, and the Pakistani Government has also continued to crackdown against them.
I think it would be much better if these Jihadi groups abandon religious extremism and continue with religious and welfare activities.
This is heart-breaking news.
What a world this is that makes life miserable for someone who invokes an important principle of Islam, the religion of Allah.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims, but if Muslims even try to take revenge, then the whole non-Muslim world together with our hypocrite leaders treats those who are honest and selfless and who care for the religion as they are treating our great leader Hafiz Saeed today!
The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan that have been sustaining criminals in the name of Jihad, they and the leaders of these Mullahs are the same people who call Pakistan land of the filthy and other bad names.
Now they are not leaving any stone unturned to destroy Pakistan.
Actually, far from being called Muslims, they do not deserve even to be called humans.
Without ridding Pakistan of these trouble-makers, national security is in danger.
Is there still a need to think about whether or not these conflict instigators should be banned?
There is no place in the world for such violent Mullahs whose job is only to kill.
The United Nations Security Council has banned Jamiat-ud-Daawa. After all, what proof does the Security Council have that it acted in such a hurry?
Doesn't the Security Council always act expeditiously against Muslims?
This is called the nonchalant plaintiff and the zealous witness!
One can observe that India itself has become a failed state!
Those whose intelligence, army, and other security agencies have failed, who were kept helpless by a few the terrorists for 72 hours, and India wants to fool the entire world by blaming its failure on Pakistan.
When a non-Muslim is killed, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why this double standard?
The only non-political, religious, welfare organization of our beloved country --------
Furqan Faruq, Faisalabad.
During the time of our Prophet (PBUH), saints, and sufis, when love and respect for all humans prevailed, the religion of Islam spread peacefully and flourished.
Muslims also progressed in all areas.
But when this beautiful religion went into the hands of extremism, men started differentiating between Muslims and non-Muslims, and new chapters of conflict and controversy started to open, which the world was not aware of before this.
Greetings. Go ahead, sir, take this action, but do it on your own.
Do not do it because of America's pressure.
If India has problems, should it provide proof?
Why doesn't it?
And why does it blame everything on us?
There are extremist groups and organizations even in India. Why don't these people put a ban on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the whole world?
What is it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What is it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the world's first Islamic country with nuclear power. Is that what the whole fuss is about?
Pakistan is at the final stages now.
Kamran Hassan, Abu Dhabi.
Your point makes sense and the situation bears it out.
Now American magazines are boldly publishing Pakistan's new map, and these bans also seem to be related to the same issue.
Americans are, quickly rather than gradually, strengthening their grip on Pakistan.
Under such conditions, if we as a nation do not display unity and harmony, then remember that if Bangladesh could be created, then much more can happen.
One cannot condemn terrorist attacks enough whether they take place in Mumbai's hotel, or in Islamabad's Marriot hotel, or in Palestine.
Similarly, terrorists should be destroyed, regardless of where they are from - Pakistan, India, America, or Israel.
Now the question arises why is the world, including the Pakistani government, silent in the face of terrorist attacks in Pakistan everyday, in which hundreds of people lose their lives?
Was the Marriot attack not done by terrorists?
Why then?
May I sacrifice myself for the interior minister Mr. Rehman Malik, by the grace of Allah, how brave and fearless the man has become!
According to the BBC, while (a committee of) the United Nations Security Council has put a ban on Jamiat-ud-Daawa, Mr. Malik says that we have not enforced a ban yet, and it will only be done after thorough deliberation.
Not just this, according to the BBC, Mr. Malik has also very forcefully called this impression wrong that the arrests of terrorists are being made "on someone's demand."
Wow, Glory be to Allah!
Security forces raided an alleged camp of the banned Lashkar-e-Tayaba in the Pakistani controlled area of Kashmir.
After the Mumbai attacks, increasing pressure is being placed on Pakistan to speed up its actions against extremist organizations.
India accuses Lashkar-e-Tayaba of involvement in the Mumbai attacks.
American foreign secretary Condoleeza Rice has urged the Pakistani leadership to take practical steps for an immediate and transparent action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks.
They say that the extremists who attacked Mumbai undoubtedly used Pakistani territory.
Meanwhile, authorities in Peshawar say that another center for the trucks that take goods to the allied forces in Afghanistan was destroyed by fire by unknown armed men, destroying more than fifty trucks.
In the past 48 hours, this is the second attack on the NATO and American supplies in Peshawar.
In the meantime, Pakistan has raided an alleged camp of the banned Lashkar-e-Tayaba. Efforts were made even before this to disarm the armed groups from Karachi to the tribal areas, and those who surrendered their arms were assured that compensation would be given to them and that no action would be taken against them.
Events tell us that the former Soviet Union's intervention in Afghanistan during General Zia-ul-Haq's period, and efforts to eliminate the armed groups that were born as a result of the resistance to it with America-Saudi funding, to take Pakistan to the state it was in before 1980, were not successful.
The question is, does Pakistan want to do this?
Does Pakistan have the capacity to do this?
What do you say?

Possessing or not possessing the capability or saying it is not wanted.
Whose war are we, the Pakistanis fighting?
And why do we also have interests that we will try to protect with all our might?
Nobody has the right to intervene in a country's affairs.
It doesn't seem to be a period of colonization.
If people expect justice, or the allies insist on an independent judiciary and respect democratic institutions, and do not assist any dictator or army, peace will be established in Third World Pakistan, which might not be acceptable to the allies.
Pakistan is working anyway to achieve the aims of Europe and America.
This in spite of the opposition of a majority of the population of Pakistan.
And this fuels more feelings against it.
If America and its allies have confidence in democracy, they should abandon the policy of a colonizer, respect the country's sovereignty, and go away from the region.
Pakistan has the capability to arm or disarm itself.
I have only one question for all the flag-bearers of humanity:
If you kill their children, will they welcome you with garlands for you? This is impossible.
Saeed, Multan.
And my question to you is do the teachings of Islam, or those of the East or West give any logic, philosophy, or reasoning that approves of the killing of innocent citizens, including people who are praying, laborers, and low-income workers, and employees, as a consequence of American attacks?
And if there is no answer, then you have a dire need to correct your point of view.
At the time when people were given arms, it was feared that Russia, after Afghanistan, would turn its attention to Pakistan; therefore people were provided the arms.
Now that we suspect America to attack Pakistan from Afghanistan, which the present American president has spoken about during his presidential campaign, why then should we disarm these people?
So that America or India, after subduing the Pakistani armed forces, do not have to face any kind of resistance from the people?
However if anyone is involved in oppressive activities, Pakistan should take an action against them only.
Regretfully, the government's seizing of Lashkar-e-Tayaba has proven India right about Pakistan being involved in this affair.
*Najeeb-ur-Rehman Saiko*, Lahore, Pakistan.
Even if it is accepted that Lashkar-e-Tayaba is involved, it is not right to blame Pakistan's Government.
And another question is did these terrorists not have the support of some government or non-government officer in India?
Are terrorists born or trained only in Pakistan and not in India, or any other countries of the world?
As far as Lashkar-e-Tayaba is concerned, it has got nothing to do with the recent acts of terrorism.
A point to remember is that it was Hafiz Saeed who was the first "Jihadi leader" to label the acts of the Taliban as "chaos."
I am completely sure that the Taliban's invasion is [a part of] American plans. Therefore, it is necessary to remove every person and group from the way who should challenge the Taliban in any way.
Despite the consensus of the whole nation, under pressure from India carrying out an action against Lashkar reflects the nervous and servile nature of Zardari and company.
To bring an end to this campaign, which was started by the Saudi and American funding, a request should be made of them, for God's sake, to clean up this mess, which has poisoned our society.
A protest should also be lodge with them as under what guise did America and Saudi Arabia spread the virus of dangerous weapons in our country and so-called Jihadis, and truly hateful literature and culture, which opened human slaughterhouses in our country?
America was badly rattled when the Pakistani army declared, after fear of an Indian attack, that it would move its forces from the Afghan border and pay attention to India, and the Taliban announced that they would take care of the Afghan border. America used all means available to stop an Indian attack on Pakistan.
And this exposed America's reputation in this area.
Although India neither threatened to attack, nor does it have the guts to do so,
the rest has been taken care of by the Taliban's attacks on American supplies.
It proves that without the support of the Pakistani army and the Pakistani Government, America is nothing.
Karachi, Pakistan's trade and finance hub is like the Dubai of all undeveloped areas.
Millions do not leave this place empty-handed. But ever since the western border areas have become lawless, Karachi has become the focus of everyone's attention.
Now they are on the verge of taking this city hostage.
For the first time, Pathans are being referred to as Pakhtuns, and inhabitants of the same city are being considered outsiders to make them fight each other, although the need is for unity.
One solution to the problem is that either the Urdu-speaking people should learn Pashto, or the Pashto-speaking people should learn Urdu, or everyone learns English, that would be even better.
You would definitely find this suggestion amusing, but don't you find the reason of the clash amusing?
That the reason for violence is language?
Zaheer Chughtai.
Actually, sir I gave this suggestion many times as a child to my friends who belonged to different religious and linguistic groups, but they used to laugh it off.
In those days, these linguistic and religious differences were not as strong and active as they are now. They were just percolating beneath the surface.
It is hard to understand what is happening and why it is happening?
Are these the signs of the Day of Judgment?
For what reason are the innocent and blameless people being killed?
The reasons are obvious. Those who want to break up Pakistan are the ones who are emotional and they do not belong to any religion or country.
Be it Karachi or Mumbai, the home has been set on fire by its own inhabitants.
Whichever government comes in, it tries to make a name for itself simply by changing the names of places; like these days, airports, roads, buildings, everything is being named after Benazir.
Does the name Benazir represent whatever is happening to the people of Karachi and Pakistan?
At the peak of the Mumbai attacks, the failure of RAW that instigated riots based on linguistic differences in Karachi is proof that the political elements that used to work on RAW's payroll in the past have resigned from their job.
The unwarranted killings of the Pashto-speaking laborers and India's threats have awakened Pakistani nationalism from Karachi to Khyber.
While this strong display of patriotism from all the political, religious, linguistic, and national parties has taught a diplomatic lesson to India, it has also given the American policy makers another opportunity to think.
Muttahida and ANP are responsible for the deterioration of the situation of Karachi, and the administration is being biased.
The administration can control the situation in an hour, but it is consciously adding fuel to the fire.
Police and Rangers avoid taking any action due to the pressure of the political parties.
The talk of unity is only limited to talk. Political parties should forget about their political gains and work for the betterment of the common man.
As long as the administration has political pressure on it, these type of incidences will keep taking place. May Allah protect Pakistan.
I think the people themselves are the greatest terrorists.
And there are surely some foreign forces involved in this, but we don't know who they are.
Sadly, had this situation taken place in some city of the Frontier Province, the government would have laid it to waste, but since it is not in the Northwest Province, the government appears to be helpless.
The government should carry out an operation here and save a big and important city from terrorism.
Otherwise, Pakistan will face a major financial crisis.
Even BBC Urdu is not telling the truth due to fear, while Pakistani media is even worse.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu-speaking people should learn Pashto, or the Pashto-speaking should learn Urdu, or it would be even better if both learn English.
You would definitely find this suggestion amusing, but don't you find the reason for this conflict amusing?
Should the reason behind violence be language?
Finally, in Karachi, another tale of brutality registered the fear that every citizen had been feeling for quite some time.
Everyone did what they felt like, without restraint. The reports that reached us through the media are just 50 percent of what happened here in four days.
Stayed awake the last three nights and the fear is still there.
Those who force people out of the hotels, and those who beat up cobblers and peanut vendors,
those who robbed on the super highway, and cut the ears of innocent people, are all unaware of the wrath of Allah, which they will face eventually.
In your opinion, what are the reasons for this sudden unrest?
(BBC)
Considering the heart-rendering Mumbai carnage, we do not need to delve too deeply into the situation to find reasons for this violence in Karachi. The straight and simple reason is that this violence happened because of some subconscious boiling of "blood."
It is obvious, if someone picks a fight with the "father," then his "son" getting out of control at this should not come as a surprise.
It was built by Liaqat Ali Khan and many others who sacrificed their lives, who were from there. To remove Mr. Saiko's misconception, I'm writing this verse.
We will carry on the tradition of our elders.
We gave our lives to create it; will give our lives to preserve it.
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui.
It's very unfortunate that the whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I suggest, if in wikipedia
you look up Liaqat Ali Khan, you would come to know that he belonged to a respectable family of the Kernal area of the Punjab province.
Because of what he did for the Muhajirs, they consider him their own today.
Every action has a reaction.
It can be tolerated if it's limited to one's own self but
Ejaz Awan
Sir, before you gather a crowd of purveyors of obscenity overnight, let me tell you that the signs of real trouble makers can be seen these days as graffiti and posters on the walls of Karachi.
We have been suffering from the mischief of both types.
Mischief makers did not leave Pakistan or even the founder of Pakistan alone; they did not have to face any consequences.
On the contrary, they're flourishing at the expense of Pakistan.
Only Muslim League (N) was left. It also prepared a draft of the eighteenth amendment and handed it over to the People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League (Q) had already submitted drafts of the eighteenth amendment in the National Assembly and the Senate.
Until now, it appears as if these drafts of the eighteenth amendment are a political ruse and no one is sincere about getting this amendment approved.
This is why no one has spoken up on the floor of the Assembly or Senate in support of this amendment nor forced the House to approve this amendment.
It seems as if by submitting the drafts of the eighteenth amendment, these parties have completed a formality that will allow them to say tomorrow that, well, we did submit the amendment. It was the government speaker who did not take action.
MQM, the government's ally; Muslim League (N), the government's ally behind the scenes; and Muslim League (Q), the party that got the seventeenth amendment passed - how then can these parties be sincere in getting the seventeenth amendment annulled?
This is a way for them to appear to be martyrs.
The People's Party is in no hurry to get the seventeenth amendment annulled anyway.
Why would anyone want to get their own hands cut off?
As long as Zardari is president, the seventeenth amendment is not about to be annulled.
This was the majority opinion in one of our surveys, and it's true as well.
If the seventeenth amendment had been annulled, Zardari would have never become president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Musharraf because he, along with being the president, is also the chair of the People's Party.
As long as he is president, the seventeenth amendment will remain in place.
To get rid of the seventeenth amendment, political parties will first have to get President Zardari out of the presidential house.
This is something neither MQM nor the other parties wants.
Most of the elders of my family belong to the working class.
When I used to see my paternal and maternal uncles and the rest of them working for daily wages, I used to pray in my heart that God would save me from such physically rigorous labor.
To get out of this, I wrote a letter to the editor of the Amroze daily newspaper and asked what I should do after graduation so that I don't have to do hard labor.
The editor wrote back that I should become a doctor or an engineer or take such-and-such subjects.
My inclination had always been towards engineering, and I had even taken technical drawing in school instead of biology.
But at the time of the F. Sc. admissions, my older brother forced me to do my F. Sc. in medicine and become a doctor.
I studied biology with difficulty for a month, but when I couldn't make heads or tails of it, I changed the subject and took math instead.
It means the dread of physical labor made me an engineer and now I have a better job than most of my peers in the family, for which I constantly thank God.
I was reminded of this when I was trying to lift a carpet with our two young sons at our old home.
Not even half an hour had passed when my younger son said, "Dad, looks like I wasn't made to do this kind of work."
I said, "If this is true, then study hard like me and save yourself from having to do hard labor."
My son said, "I am studying and I'll keep doing it, but I can't do this work."
We got the job done as best we could in three hours and returned home.
The point is that if a man sets his sights on something, whatever his reason is behind that, nothing can stop him from getting what he wants.
But if you don't even know what you want to do, only Allah can save you.
They say not to say bad things about the dead, but what should we do - we see nothing but Benazir's misdeeds even a year after she died.
For the sake of her own interests, Benazir provided India a list of names of the Sikhs who were fighting for their independence, whereby on the one hand she crushed their independence movement, and on the other she gave India the opportunity to suppress the Punjab movement and focus all its attention on Kashmir.
It was Benazir and Nawaz Sharif's tug-of-war for power that set the country many years behind.
Benazir, during her exile, continued to make negative statements about Kashmir and the atomic program.
Violating the London agreement she had made with Nawaz Sharif, Benazir made a deal with General Musharraf.
Benazir, during her time in office, freely gave her husband the opportunity to make money, and this is why he was called Mr. Ten Percent.
During Benazir's time, her brother was murdered and his murderers have still not been punished.
Despite being a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
In the same way Benazir thrived as a politician because of her father's death, her widowed husband is now thriving as a politician because of hers.
Benazir got control of the government twice, but she couldn't even file a case against those responsible for her father's political murder, let alone get them punished.
It has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us, but look at the insensitivity of our people and our rulers - we neither mourned on this day nor lamented our mistakes.
What we should have done was to commemorate December 16 as a lesson and come up with the kinds of strategies that could prevent such a misfortune from recurring.
We should have sent goodwill messages to the people of Bangladesh on this day and tried to bring them close to us again.
Rulers should have opened the Hamood-ur-Rehman Commission's file and deliberated on the reasons for East Pakistan's separation.
They should have come up with a strategy for bringing back the Biharis stuck in Bangladesh, and sent them gifts to encourage them.
But we have become insensitive. If someone dies in our neighborhood, we do not even find out about it.
We don't care about our sisters and brothers anymore because we've become selfish.
Even if a great tragedy occurs, the next day we get tied up in our day-to-day affairs.
I wish East and West Pakistan could reunite the same way that East and West Germany did.
We can be one again if both make sacrifices for each other and break out of the shell of selfishness.
But it doesn't look like this wish will be fulfilled anytime in the near future.
Today, when it was stated in the news that the governor of the American state of Illinois was arrested on charges of corruption
and that to take him out of office, the Provincial Congress has started to make preparations to call him to account as soon as possible, one of our white American friends who keeps a close watch on the situation in Pakistan challenged us as he boasted, "See, this is what democracy is."
Not even the most important person in America is above the law.
And then we have your country, Pakistan, where even the president came into office only after getting the corruption charges dropped.
I took it with a sense of humor and said, "So what if one governor was arrested in America? In our Pakistan, the prime minister was arrested and hanged overnight one time, and another one was sent into exile.
Tell me, did this ever happen in America?"
Pakistan gave a guard of honor to a president who broke the national law as he left his house. Tell me, did this ever happen in America?
In Pakistan, the chief justice was suspended in such a way that, despite having popular support, he still has not been reinstated. Did this ever happen in America?
The holder of a counterfeit degree was made the Minister of Health in Pakistan. Did this ever happen in America?
When he heard this, the poor American laughed hysterically as he accepted his defeat.
In this photograph, President Zardari is smiling even though he is surrounded on all four sides by Americans.
He is smiling as if
he thinks that America is in favor of his government, but he is forgetting that a year ago the same people were in favor of Pervez Musharraf.
This photograph has been taken just like a family picture.
Before this, such a photograph with one president and six American officials was never allowed to be published.
It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased so much that not just one official can take care of it, they have to team up - either that or they don't trust their new slave the way they trusted the one before him.
It could also be that this arrangement was made while keeping in mind President Zardari's notoriety for going back on his promises.
Had it been some sensible ruler, at least he would not have sported such a smile in the photograph; at least there would have been some shame on his face because of the collar of slavery he's wearing.
If the principle of democracy is applied to this photograph, President Zardari is in the minority.
In a democracy, only a majority rules the country, and this photograph shows who the majority is.
In spite of army operations underway for over a year in the Frontier Province's insurgency-ridden area of Swat, the situation has been going from bad to worse.
On the one hand, the government's writ in this area has been reduced to approving condemnatory resolutions in the National Assembly; on the other, Taliban's illegal FM radio channel's influence seems to be increasing in Swat.
Thirdly, the common citizen thinks the only way to be safe is to listen to whoever has the power in the area.
During the operations in Swat carried out by security forces, it is claimed that gunship helicopters and bombings of arsenals killed many extremists, but in spite of these killings, not only has the Taliban grown stronger - according to one estimate, their control has been established in 80 percent of Swat.
In conclusion, the government is not ready to accept its failure, and the Taliban is stronger.
The ones who got stuck in the middle were the poor citizens.
It is said that someone in Swat asked what kind of people Taliban members are - the answer came that they are very good people because they are protectors of religion and they fight against the "enemies of Allah and religion."
When asked what the army is like, the answer came that it's very good because it "protects our homeland" and fights against "the country's enemies."
Then when asked who the enemies of religion and our homeland are; the answer came "we the citizens."
The heavenly Swat is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
Until now, according to government strategy, negotiations are being held along with the use of power.
But the use of force is having no benefit other than to increase the strength of the Taliban and create sympathy for them among the people.
There is a need for the government to eliminate the reasons for this problem instead of using force.
By eliminating the reasons, Fazlullah and the Taliban will fall apart on their own.
The Sharia Bill proposed by the ANP government will go a long way to help solve the problems of Swat.
But along with enforcing Sharia, the government will also need to focus on the economic problems.
From the initial steps taken by General Musharraf, it looked like the nation might be rid of incompetent politicians but the lust for power changed all his plans.
Whatever the hopes were in becoming a part of the &quot;war of terror&quot; he started thinking of himself as truly immortal
and the expected steps he would take were disappointed.
Just like when Bush's term in office was coming to an end, he started worrying about the end of his power and in the confusion made a deal with thieves.
General Musharraf could still control the army but the current government does not even know what is happening.
Be it Bajaur or Swat, the army does not control terror and bombs the people, causing physical loss and loss of property, making the &quot;enemy&quot; a mental patient, which means we are the enemy.
I don't know how the Pakistani army will fight against the Indian army when it could not control a small Taliban group.
They could not track the Taliban's illegal FM channel, which I think should be very easy to do.
Even now this FM is spewing its venom with full force.
After the girls' schools, now the boys' schools are being destroyed.
A curfew is imposed to make it easy for the Taliban to move.
Tonight during the curfew, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mingora during the curfew and made trenches.
The question that arises is how they managed to get there in spite of the curfew.
The army can kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but it salutes the Taliban.
For Allah's sake, somebody make this army understand that they should get the helpless people of Swat out of the Taliban's grip and prove that the Pakistani army can overpower any enemy.
The gentleman says, "Most of the blood in the world has been spilled on the basis of religions; tell me now, would there be all this killing if there were no religion?"
Punjabi, Pathan, white and black, Mehsood and other tribes - are they all the results of religion?
No, absolutely not. Sir, religion is what teaches us that there is no black or white, no Punjabi or Muhajir. If there were no religion, half the world would have been destroyed in the battle between blacks and whites and the rest in the animosity between races.
Actually, it is religion that gives humans moral training and restraints. Humans did not come here on their own - the creator of the universe sent them here, and they must live according to His command.
As a Muslim, I am sure that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After moving to London, for several years I called each of my relatives first thing in the morning to ask how they were doing, although most of them had never even called me once to ask how I was doing. Then I realized that they do not even like me calling them. I stopped calling them.
I have felt the same living here in France for two years.
I don't know why but people expect me to be the one to make the phone call.
A resolution about Iraq passed in a few hours; sending "peace" troops to Darfur is not a problem at all.
Immediate condemnation of the Mumbai attacks and a sanction on suspected organizations is in a matter of a few hours.
And we are deliberating about the places where death is rampant.
Hey you architects of world peace, lives are ending here!
Are you perhaps just waiting for it to end?
So that no oppressed person can even think of using a weapon of mass destruction like a slingshot to get his rights?
When a father is fleeing with the corpse of his dear son in his hands, does no part of your heart ache, even then?
If not, then you don't deserve to be called human.
You're a black stain on the name of humanity.
So it is proven that this area was the homeland of the Israelis, too, for thousands of years.
Ideally, both nations should live together in peace, but since their strings are in the hands of the West and the Arab countries, there can never be peace here without their approval.
Even Iran now wants to fight its proxy war from here.
Even if the Israeli operation stops for the time being, it will start up again after some other incident.
The interests of BBC's country lie with favoring America and Israel, and this is the reason why it has come out with a series of blogs on "Zionism" in the guise of "open-mindedness" and is making blind and one-sided "propaganda."
BBC is merely fulfilling a formality and its only aim is to gather sympathies.
The moderator is requested to publish the comment of this humble applicant so that we can get an idea whether BBC still has any semblance of realism its material.
Thanks.
Whoever wrote this story or however it came into existence, it is true that every age has had a Dracula who drinks innocent human blood.
Every age has seen wars and every age has seen bloodshed.
The strange thing is how this person who thinks himself a very cultured person of the twenty-first century is silent over this massacre in broad daylight;
how he cannot feel that what is happening is showing the worst possible face of humanity.
The sad and tragic part of it is what picture this dark side of the cultured person will present to the person of the coming century.
Best regards, Sajjad ul-Hasnain, Hyderabad Deccan
Right now, along with Dera Ghazi Khan, the whole country is receiving winter rains.
Here's a poem that goes along with the weather. Along with this poem, enjoy the rain.
Even these rains are like you
When they fall, there is spring
When they pause, there is rest
At times, coming without a reason
At times, engulfing day with night
At times there is noise, at times silence
Even these rains are like you
In someone's thoughts some night
Buried ash
Once extinguished
Which again ignited itself
At times there is grief in every drop
Even these rains are like you
All these rulers are about to run away with briefcase in hand. They couldn't care less whether the country survives or not.
Whether the people sell toothpaste or clean the bells of a temple with the skin of a lemon.
For one thing, our media is as corrupt as our rulers.
Its only aim is to amass wealth from the government, nothing else.
As far as the people are concerned, they remain ignorant, and talking about them would be even more ignorant.
A strange thing happened yesterday afternoon.
All the police running around, but no one asks about the illegal parking
or even looks at the cars. Illegal parking in NYPD traffic is another story.
It just so happened that a USAir vessel really became a vessel and landed in the Hudson river.
All the goose knows at this point is that the "terrorists" are related to the birds.
Yesterday was perhaps the coldest day in New York history.
It doesn't usually go that low.
My own jaw started to hurt after a half-hour walk outside.
You can imagine how the people must have felt who jumped from the plane into the river.
The good news is that all the people were safe.
And the bad news is that the company's plane drowned in this financial crisis.
Watching this, I went to New Jersey via the West Side Highway, even when I saw that the southbound lane was closed, so what did I do?
Yes, I got stuck in traffic on my return.
Thankfully, during my one-hour trip the way opened up to some extent so I found the 56 Street exit.
Seeing the lines across the first two exits, I had not taken them.
Miki, My Pakistan: Congratulations to you, too. Happy Eid.
Ammar: Of course faithful ones.
Shagufta: Congratulations to you, too. Happy Eid.
Sara: I did two chickens. We do sacrifice, and Jahanzeb has explained the way we do it.
Other than this, there is no other way.
And one needs to cook meat by oneself on this farm, including taking the skin off.
Basim: It might take time for dot net to be repaired.
What happened at the farm?
Linku
To beat the snow off the blog, try Firefox.
Duffer: Congratulations to you, too. Happy Eid.
Sir, use Firefox.
The snow will disappear.
We were considering the Swati Taliban group to be uncultured just because they were complaining about the education of women.
Every day somewhere or other they were expressing their anger by demolishing schools and colleges for women.
But like most opinions, this one also proved to be incorrect. According to CNN, today, on the blessed day of Monday, a Taliban group blew up a boys' school.
Swat, Taliban Demolish Boys' School
In reality the girls' schools had only been demolished first based upon the famous English saying, "Ladies first." Who knows why people are still determined to call the Taliban uncultured, devoid of culture, savage?
It is also made clear by this that the accusation leveled against the Taliban, that they're only against the education of girls is wrong -
Allah save them, they are against education itself.
May Allah the holy grant these holy warriors more strength
and help them uproot the corrupt government that has been set over us.
Amen.
God save them; to this point 182 schools have been demolished.
Amongst Muslims there are traditions of deciding on the wedding of a boy and a girl even before their birth, getting a girl married to the Quran just to take away her property, and many Muftis insisting that a girl becomes mature at the age of eight. As if these were not enough, a girl was wed to a frog in India.
Look at the picture of the bridegroom taken at his wedding.
This brought to mind the recent marriage of a girl to a dog.
Look at that bridegroom, too.
Humanity is scarce even in the twenty-first century.
This is the age of computers, and the interference of computers in every part of life is increasing.
Many people have reservations about this growing interference of computers, in things such as financial matters.
While it makes the use of credit cards easy, it is also easier for law enforcement agencies to keep track of your personal life.
Now you can be traced through financial transactions such as the record of your use of a credit card.
And in the future, when the use of real money becomes extremely rare, it will be even more useful.
In the crime world too, instead of taking the risk of robbing a bank, the information from a credit card is hacked.
Similarly, now there are even ways of making friends through computers.
Social networking websites like Orkut, Facebook, and Myspace rank highest in terms of popularity.
But don't you think that the more we comply with these social networking sites, the more we are getting distanced from people on a practical level?
There are even match-making websites, where your preferences are matched with the preferences of other people and the list of those compatible with you is provided.
Now can you spend your life with another person who is just like you?
I cannot. The reason why a life partner is also called the better half
is that they make up for my flaws.
I may have gotten the lesser share of wisdom.
Since childhood, whatever my elders said was the truth to me.
For example, I was sure that my father knew the answers to all the questions in the world.
I was even made fun of because of this.
However, something seemed true to me only if it could be possible.
It was very perplexing why there was a need to lie.
I even suffered at that age for this reason.
Therefore, I try to lie as little as possible.
I try not to give anyone false hopes, especially in the name of Allah.
And I only say "Allah willing" when praying to Allah that he fulfill some request.
Allah knows best what my intentions are.
This is a nauseating problem, which has arisen because of estrangement from religion.
According to both our religion and the law of Pakistan, young children should stay with their mother.
It is the father's duty to take care of their expenses, and he is allowed to meet with the children.
Then when the children grow up, they can live with whomever they want.
You have rightly pointed out that relatives are the real problem because they give the wrong advice.
Why does our society frown upon the re-marriage of a 50- or 55-year-old husband or wife who has lost his or her spouse?
We have a Pakistani uncle close to us. His wife died ten or twelve years ago. When he married a widow after getting all his children married, they all turned against him.
In my view this is a right that has been granted to him by the Sharia. What do you think?
What kind of an attitude do we have that makes us say that we can't tolerate anyone taking our mother's place?
The feudal mindset dictates all our actions.
The same mindset is at work here, that our father will have more children to claim their share in his property, so he must be stopped; if it weren't for this, their father's act would be praised and emulated.
It is these hang-ups about marriage that have created the evils in our society.
The concept of a marriage for a divorced or widowed woman is becoming extinct.
Because of these useless beliefs and misplaced traditions, the family system is breaking down.
I think this man's children should consider that if he married a widow after getting all of them married, what did he do wrong?
This way the widow got support, and the uncle also got someone to take care of him.
Because his children must have gotten tied up in their own worlds, giving him no time.
The reason behind this is ignorance.
If their wives refuse to take care of them when they're old, what will they do?
This is a result of societal pressure.
When people ridicule a family for such a thing, children start to feel embarrassed because of their father's re-marriage,
when they should face up to the situation and say that what their father did was completely in accordance with Islam.
This is a curse in our society, which we have been suffering from for the last 40-50 years.
A wife even accepts it if her husband goes around having extra-marital relations, but she does not allow him to marry a second time.
If she could, she wouldn't even let him do it after her death.
On top of ruining things for her husband, she ruins them for herself in the afterlife as well, and also gives cause to the spread of filth in society.
It's no use talking about Islam; in reality we only like what goes along with our traditions and customs.
For instance trading girls for marriage, killing girls for accusations of adultery, depriving girls of an education, and shooting them for marrying of their own choice.
As far as your question is concerned, instead of bringing the widow to his own home, if the man had gone to the widow's home, his heirs would have settled down and been satisfied after making some fuss about it (although the widow's heirs would then become jealous).
Although we accepted Islam in the Indian sub-continent centuries ago, to this day we have not been able to get rid of this ignorant mindset and still prefer tradition and custom over Islam.
A man's second marriage is obscene, divorce is a blot that cannot be hidden, a divorced woman is untouchable, marriage by choice ruins reputations, and a man's marriage with a older woman is seen as a result of the woman's trickery. All these attitudes reflect the same mindset.
And to copy the Western nations we call abstinence and using the veil an outdated thing.
Accepting Islam was easy; getting rid of this mindset is very difficult.
May Allah give us all the strength and courage for this.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never this hard.
Centuries have passed since I've written so much.
Consider this little bit enough.
May Allah protect you.
Ameer Taimur in his book I Am Taimur writes that I have learned one thing in life - if the commander of an army is on the front line that army will never lose.
But here, the situation is totally different.
They say, "The common people are here to die for us. If we die, we're martyrs."
If a common person dies, it's just a casualty.
Peace, mercy, and blessing be upon you.
Tonight when I was coming back to the shop after prayers, a man sitting in a car raised his hand to call my attention.
I thought, maybe he's lost or wants to ask me something. I stopped and saw that his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked me if I could understand Arabic well or not. I said, "No problem, tell me what's the matter."
He said, "I have come here to Madina from Riyaz, but someone has pick pocketed me. Please help me." I said, "Sorry brother, I've fallen for this trick before. I gave a guy twenty riyals to fill up with petrol to go to Riyaz, but he just went a little way down the road and started telling people the same story."
I got really angry and tried to scare him off saying I'd call a cop, so he took off.
The situation has become such that we Muslims take our family with us on a car to beg and make at least two to three thousand a day.
Whereas there is a clear tradition (may Allah bless him and give him peace) that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand because the upper hand gives while the lower one takes.
(May the most high Allah be kind to us and make us true Muslims. Amen.)
Peace to you

Distinguished singer Adnan Sami's wife went to a police station in Mumbai, accusing him of beating her.
The police have advised her to go to court.
Adnan Sami's wife Sabah Guladari filed a petition against her husband that he constantly beats her,
treats her inhumanely,
and now this has become unbearable for her so a case should be filed against Adnan Sami.
The police advised her to go to the court instead of filing a case, saying that they could not get involved in the matter.
In your opinion, is Adnan Sami's wife's accusation against him true?
Could this accusation be an attempt by India to ruin Adnan Sami's reputation?
Tell us what you think about this.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
As far as accusations are concerned, anyone can make them against someone.
There's nothing more important than respectability.
Whatever the relations are between Adnan Sami and his present wife, Adnan Sami left a respectable life and went to India to earn money. Now this popularity has become a liability to him.
This is a consequence of his own actions.
Washington...
Senior American officials say that President Obama will maintain a tough stand regarding Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
In America's new strategy for Afghanistan, war has been given more importance than development.
Officials say that Hamid Karzai is being considered a hindrance in the achievement of American objectives in Afghanistan because there is corruption in the government, the drug business has increased, and Taliban forces are reforming.
American officials say that in the American administration, the ones who are pressurizing Hamid Karzai to do more include Vice President Joe Biden and Richard Holbrooke, President Obama's representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan.
They said that this strategy has emerged after the departure of President Bush, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai every two weeks and emphasize the American role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and it's urban organizations.
Officials say that the Obama administration will work with provincial leaders as an alternative to the central government.
Officials say that they will urge Hamid Karzai to continue the war against corruption.
Hamid Karzai will face new elections this year, and it is not yet clear whether or not Obama and his associates will support him for the presidency.
Is this statement by the American officials a prelude to a change in American policy?
Is Hamid Karzai's time coming to an end?
What is your opinion about this?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka beat Pakistan 2-1.
In the first one-day match, Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka, but in the next two matches, Sri Lanka came out on top.
The national cricket team's performance was extremely poor in the third one-day match. It collapsed after 75 runs in only 23 overs, in response to Sri Lanka's 309 runs, thus facing a punitive defeat.
The results of the series prove that there is a lack of consistency in the performance of the national cricket team.
Despite all the claims and the advantage of playing on home ground, the national team faced defeat. What do you think are the reasons?
Which areas of play do the authorities need to pay attention to?
Are you satisfied with the team's selection?
Which area do you blame for the defeat - fielding, batting, or bowling?
Tell us what you think.
Malik Babar Hussain, Jeddah. It is very sad that even in modern times, such traditions of ignorance are still in place. Landowners and others with power and prestige use their tyrannical authority to target innocent people. Who would call them Muslim?
Some day one of these men with power should walk on these coals himself. Why doesn't the present government do anything against them?
When will there be justice from the courts?
The Sri Lankan cricket team has come to Pakistan to play a one-day international series.
A foreign cricket team coming to Pakistan in spite of the tension between Pakistan and India is a promising sign.
Sri Lanka's team was warmly welcomed on its arrival at the Karachi airport.
There will be two one-day matches between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Karachi, and a third one-day in Lahore.
Both teams are making vociferous claims about their bowling, batting, and fielding.
Sri Lankans are proud of their spinners, while Pakistan trusts its fast bowling.
Sri Lanka's captain Mahela Jayawardene says that it's not just one player in Pakistan's team; the whole team is a force to be contended with.
Murlitharan and Mendis will be the trump cards; Pakistan's captain says the competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik has said, "We have played Murlitharan; we'll see how Mendis does. We've prepared a secret game plan, which we will demonstrate on the field."
Will Pak versus Sri Lanka be as interesting and sensational as is claimed?
Which team will dominate in the series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Tell us what you think.
Gulfam, London. You publish statements of your choice and those are the ones you give preference to. We wish that you also write something true. Do not play with words like Mukherjee, because we have been ordered to speak the truth in front of an unjust ruler, and this is the same as jihad. What to say about Mukherjee, he tries to stay in the news by changing what he says.
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband has said that solving the Kashmir issue would end extremism and enable the government of Pakistan to take care of the threats emerging in the Frontier Province effectively.
Before this, American President-elect Obama had already expressed similar thoughts on the Kashmir issue.
The British Foreign Secretary, in his talk with the media in Mumbai and in one of his essays, has said that the idea of a war on terror is wrong. Justifying the murder of people on the basis of the threats that faced him was the policy of President Bush.
David Miliband has said that Pakistan should not show any leniency to extremist groups.
Due to the emphasis the superpowers have placed on the need to resolve the Kashmir conflict, could India be trying to divert attention from this problem by creating tension in the region?
Could the terrorism in Mumbai be a part of this strategy?
Does India want to avoid inclusive negotiations using terrorism as an excuse?
Tell us what you think.
Malik Yousuf, Dubai.
All this has been done by these people. Kashmiris have been fighting for freedom for the last sixty years.
No, no one asked them. Now that they are stuck in the war against extremism and terrorism, peace talks have been started.
First they massacred Muslims, and now they want to resolve issues.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand the double standards in their policy.
Asad Khan, London
India is creating a kind of situation to divert the world's attention from Kashmir,
but Pakistan has always shown the world the true face of India.
Now the British government also understands this, which is why on the basis of the terrorism in India it is defaming Pakistan and ignoring the occupancy of Kashmir
and is hesitating in talking to Pakistan about this problem.
Usman Aftab
I don't think the superpowers want to cause permanent harm to Pakistan;
rather, they are thinking of ways to control it. They know that Pakistan is an atomic power.
They want to create some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries are just thinking that cornering Pakistan could create difficulties politically and geographically; they want both to help Pakistan and to achieve their own aims, too.
A citizen, USA.
Hindus have always had the tradition of appearing calm on the surface but carrying grudges on the inside.
I think they get a stomachache every now and then and start threatening Pakistan.
We are ready in every way. The Indian Chief of the Army should shut up, or else we know how shut him up.
Faheem Siddiqui.
Ras al-Khaima, this battle of words is taking place because of America's wickedness. America was always sick in the head, but now India has become this way as well. If they attack, then they'll learn who's the boss.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the guts to stop them. India, too - following the pattern of Israel - India, too, wants to do something like this.
Prime Minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani has said that the American Vice President-elect Joe Biden played an important role in making ex-President Musharraf step down from office and in bringing back the sham of democracy, which is why the government of Pakistan awarded him the Sitara-e-Imtiaz.
No political party should get the credit for making someone step down from office or the restoration of democracy. Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions are made in Parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Dr. Qadeer's chapter has been closed.
In your opinion, were the protests by the people against dictatorship of no importance?
Did the lawyers' movement play no role?
What is your response to this statement made by the Prime Minister?
Tell us what you think.
American President George W. Bush said in his final press conference that he made a lot of mistakes during his term as president and advised President-elect Barack Obama to do what he feels is right.
"As president I acted in keeping with circumstances and the American Constitution and law, and I gave preference to American interests over my own popularity."
He said, "The enemies of America are still planning to attack America and the greatest challenge for Barack Obama will be to stop them."
He said, "My greatest disappointment is not having found the weapons of mass destruction from Iraq and my biggest mistake was to accept that the mission in Iraq was completed."
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said, "This is my last press conference and I thank all the journalists and other friends who have come to the conference."
Do you think Obama will not repeat the mistakes made by Bush?
Didn't Bush take too long to admit to his mistakes?
Will Obama be able to act upon Bush's advice?
Tell us what you think.
American Vice President Dick Cheney says, "I want to see Osama bin Laden dead or alive."
He says that Osama bin Laden is hiding in some area that is difficult to reach and has become ineffective for his organization. Whether Osama is captured dead or alive, his his organization will have to be stopped.
America is determined to capture Osama and its search for Osama should continue.
Will Dick Cheney's hope to capture Osama be able to be fulfilled?
Tell us what you think.
Shahid Afridi, the all-rounder cricketer, got into a fight with a spectator after play ended on the first day of the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy match between PIA and Habib Bank.
Just as Shahid Afridi came out of his drawing room onto the UBL ground after the match, a large number of fans surrounded him.
At one point, a spectator grabbed Afridi's hand and asked him to be in a picture with him. Shahid Afridi, pushing him aside, told him to take the picture tomorrow, but on the spectator's insistence, Afridi became infuriated and slapped his face. Before they could get into a fight, the people around them settled the matter.
Afterwards Shahid Afridi said, "This is needlessly being made into an issue. I was in a hurry to go to prayers at that time.
Anyway, I apologize to that spectator."
What would you say about Shahid Afridi's behavior?
Tell us what you think.
The Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has once again accused Pakistan of stirring up an atmosphere of war
and using terrorism as a state policy.
Speaking at the conference of Chief Ministers in New Delhi, Manmohan Singh said that terrorist elements are supported by neighboring countries, especially Pakistan
and the terrorists behind the Mumbai attacks used the sea route while avoiding the Indian Coast Guard.
The Indian prime minister said that Lashkar-e-Tayaba carried out the Mumbai attacks in November.
He added, "Terrorists are using new techniques and the most modern communication systems. We will have to heighten security on the Line of Control as well, from which intrusions are made." He said, "Terrorism will not be tolerated under any conditions; this is our policy."
How do you see this accusation by the Indian Prime Minister?
Are internal turmoil and separatist movements in India reflective of the Indian anxiety?
On whose instructions has India assumed such threatening conduct?
Tell us what you think.
Israel's air raids on Gaza continue as usual. By now hundreds of Palestinian men, women, and children have been killed.
Nizar Rayyan, an important Hamas political leader, has been martyred along with his wife and children.
Meanwhile, the meeting of the Security Council has ended without reaching a decision.
In the meeting, the condemnatory resolution presented by Libya and other Arab countries faces American opposition.
Israel's aerial bombing of Palestine's civilian population has continued for the past few days.
The whole world raised a fuss over the Mumbai events, but why can't anyone, including America and Britain, see the massacre taking place under the Israeli attacks?
Why are the important countries of the Muslim Ummah silent?
What do you have to say about the world's double standard?
Zubair Khan, Karachi
It is a great tragedy that Israelis are massacring Palestinians. Here, the situation in Kashmir is the same, but the Security Council is not bothered in the least.
Whatever organizations are present in Palestine and Kashmir should continue their struggle until they are free and, creating unity amongst themselves, continue to fight against any type of aggression. One day, Allah willing, their martyrdom will produce results.
The electricity and gas crisis has reached a critical point all over Pakistan.
On the other hand, since January 1 gas rates have been increased by eight percent on the average, while the unavailability of petrol is a cause of serious concern for people in various cities of the country.
Extreme reactions, emergencies, and violent demonstrations are afoot amongst Pakistani industrial and business circles because of the long blackouts and the gas crisis.
Industrialists have given an ultimatum for shutting down factories.
Here in Karachi, anxiety can be seen amongst the citizens because of the eight to ten hours of load-shedding.
Industrial activity has almost been paralyzed.
Governmental institutions are stating their position by hurling accusations at each other about the issue.
Isn't the talk of increasing the price of electricity and gas a joke to the nation?
Why isn't attention being given to solving the problems?
Can't the government see national progress coming to a standstill?
What immediate steps would you recommend to overcome this crisis?
Tell us what you think.
Saeed, New York.
I think the point is that most of our nation is illiterate; they don't even know where their money is going. The government has an interest to fulfill its responsibilities by levying taxes. The electricity and gas crisis will remain the same,
because everyone knows the character of those whom the people elected.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwara. I want to say that the rulers are just like the people.
I'm surprised that those who claim to be a people's government are in fact hurting the people.
The shortage of electricity, petrol, and gas has become a disaster.
The government has no control over its institutions.
The law and order situation is worsening every day. May Allah have mercy on this country.
The new year has started.
Last year saw a lot of tumult and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered for terrorism.
President Musharraf's removal from power, the end of President Bush's eight-year term, a rain of shoes on Bush, the establishment of a democratic government in Pakistan, unexpected catastrophes, the earthquake in Balochistan, the worldwide financial crisis, the market recession.
Now that the new year is coming, how do you see it?
In your view, what results come from the political or geographical situation? What will Obama's strategy be?
Is there hope for success in bringing an end to terrorism?
Will the judicial crisis in Pakistan end?
What direction will Pak-India relations take?
Is there a chance of a surgical strike or an all-out war?
What do you expect from the new year?
Tell us what you think.
The first anniversary of Benazir Bhutto's martyrdom is being observed. She was assassinated on December 27, 2007, after an election rally in Liaquat Bagh of Rawalpindi.
Benazir is not with us anymore. She was a statesman, a politician and a world-famous persona. She had a unique position in national politics.
Even though a year has passed, the mystery of her assassination has not been solved to this day.
Her hard work toward the establishment of democracy and government in Pakistan were not in vain.
Today Pakistan has a democratic government, and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, holds the rank of President.
How do you see role of the assassinated Benazir Bhutto in Pakistani politics?
Who could be behind her assassination?
Recently, she was also given the international human rights award. What do you have to say about her services to politics and democracy?
President Bush, after ruling America for eight years, left the White House for the presidential office at Camp David so that the White House could be redecorated according to preferences of President-elect Barack Obama.
During Bush's eight years as president, the historical attack and destruction of the World Trade Center, the attack on the Pentagon, then under the pretense of a global war against terror, America's dragging of the armies of other countries into its military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and the full use of its resources in this war, became the memorabilia of Bush's term.
Because of this war, America itself has had to face the worst economic and financial crisis in its history.
In your opinion, what did the world lose and what did it gain from this war?
Were the policies of President Bush successful?
What is your opinion about President Bush's term of office?
The Indian government has refused to allow the Indian cricket team to tour Pakistan.
During the Pakistan tour, the Indian cricket team was to play three tests, five one-day matches, and one 20-20 match.
When speaking with Geo News, Indian Cricket Board's Vice-President Rajeev Shukla said that they had sought permission for the Pakistan tour from the government, but due to the current tension between the two countries, the tour will not be possible.
Is the Indian government's justification for canceling the Indian cricket team's tour on the basis of the current political situation a right step? Shouldn't sports be kept separate from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision harmful for cricket?
If the English cricket team has continued its tour of India despite the decline in the security situation, why can't the Indian team tour Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this?
Salman, Karachi.
Those who take pride in going to India
or get their movies or videos made there should open their eyes and see how little the Indian people respect them.
I remember an interview with Adnan Sami in which he said that he was not a Pakistani, but a British citizen.
Adnan Sami should come to Pakistan at the earliest opportunity if the fame he got in India wasn't to his tastes!
Fareed Ahmed,
Karachi.
The Indians' behavior has changed after the Mumbai attack.
Jagjit Singh has reacted to it by saying that he hates Pakistan and Pakistanis.
It should be known that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhosle. How did he become tone-deaf now? Adnan Sami should stay in India, there's no need for him to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam,
Karachi. About Jagjit Singh's statement, I would only say that he changes his color just like a chameleon,
changing his statement according to the situation. Pakistanis, open your eyes and see how little you are appreciated in India. Understand the mentality of the Hindus.
Their malicious battle of words has increased after the Mumbai incident, and now they're saying venomous things about the famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to a foreign news agency, on President Bush's farewell visit to Iraq during a press conference with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in his Baghdad office, the situation turned amusing when an Iraqi journalist, addressing President Bush, said, "This is a farewell kiss, dog."
After this, the journalist took off one of his shoes and threw it at Bush. President Bush dexterously saved himself by ducking his head before the shoe hit him.
The second shoe hit the American flag.
Security workers dragged the journalist off the scene.
On the occasion, President Bush said, "I don't know why he did this. The shoe was a size ten; I wasn't upset."
Don't you think this act of the journalist was an expression of the anger that the Iraqi people have for President Bush?
What would you say about this incident?
The tension that had been created in relations between Pakistan and India after the incidents of terrorism in Mumbai took a serious turn when warplanes of the Indian Air Force violated Pakistani air space in the Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
The Indian planes were forced to return because of the response by the Pakistan Air Force.
According to sources, both of the Indian planes were equipped with arms and ammunition.
This is the first incident of its kind in the current tense situation.
The Pakistan Air Force says that the Air Force is fully prepared to defend the country.
Information Minister Sherry Rehman says that Indian officials have accepted that the air space was violated, but that it was by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this a serious incident.
Do you think India, in reality, intends to undertake an air raid on Pakistan?
Is the Indian stance of having violated the air space by mistake correct, or was its aim to gauge the capability of the Pakistan Air Force?
Will this incident become a reason for an increase of tension in the relations between these countries?
Tell us what you think.
The honorable martyr Benazir Bhutto was given a posthumous international award for human rights, which was received by her son and People's Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
In a ceremony held during the meeting of the General Assembly in United Nations headquarters, the martyred Benazir Bhutto, once Pakistan's Prime Minister, was given the award as a recognition of her services to the cause of human rights.
The sixtieth anniversary of their resolution for human rights was celebrated by the United Nations on the tenth of December.
In addition to Benazir Bhutto, those persons and organizations that have been given awards on the occasion to recognize their work for human rights include America's ex-Attorney General Louis Ramsey Clark and the international organization Human Rights Watch, which works for human rights worldwide.
Pakistan's Representative to the United Nations Abdullah Hussain Haroon and other senior Pakistani diplomatic officials were also present on the occasion.
What would you say about the honorable ex-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto Shaheed receiving this award?
Sumair,
Chicago.
It's true that she was martyred but it should also be remembered that she killed so many innocent people in Karachi, of which she used to say proudly that Naseerullah Babar has done a very good job,
but later she completely changed.
But it's also true that she ignored senior members of her party and chose her son to be the representative of the People's Party. What kind of democracy is this?
The United Nations Security Council's panel has added to its list of terrorists the names of Hafiz Muhammad Saeed along with three other Pakistani citizens, and the name of Jamiat-ud-Daawa along with five other organizations.
In the list of terrorists approved by the Security Council's Al-Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee, the names of Pakistanis include Jamiat-ud-Daawa's leader Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, banned organization Lashkar-e-Tayaba's chief of operations Zaki Rehman Lakhvi, and head of the finance division Haji Muhammad Ashraf.
In addition, the name of Saudi resident Mahmood Ahmed Bazik is also included in the list of terrorists.
These organizations include Jamiat-ud-Daawa, Pasban-e-Kashmir, Ar-Rashid Trust, and Al-Akhtar Trust International.
Member countries will immediately freeze the assets of all these persons and organizations. They will not be allowed to travel, and they will be arrested.
They will be faced with court cases.
Are these restrictions under the influence of Indian propaganda?
Why is India accusing these organizations of the Mumbai attacks without any proof?
Are there no terrorist organizations in India?
Are global organizations not aware of the oppression being done in India against the minorities?
Tell us what you think.
Jimmy Noor, Karachi. From this news, what the Quran says has been proven true, that an infidel will only support an infidel.
But until an iron axe is given a handle, the axe cannot cut a wing.
These are the ways of our rulers. They are keeping their ways secret, and for this reason the country is facing disasters.
May Allah guide our rulers.
The Eid holiday is an expression of joy and happiness, and Muslims, following the tradition of Abraham, sacrifice animals on Eid-ul-Azha.
In these disturbing times when inflation is at its peak and the political situation has deteriorated, in spite of this both rich and poor prepare for Eid, as best they can and wish their loved ones a happy Eid, in different ways.
We also are providing you an opportunity through the blog to wish your loved ones a happy Eid in the form of short messages.
You can also wish a happy Eid through verses of poetry that suit the occasion.
Murtaza Gilani,
Karachi. Our rulers should understand that the people that are conducting this operation against are fans of Pakistan; even though they're suffering this kind of oppression, they still love Pakistan.
If there were a war, they would fight shoulder-to-shoulder with Pakistan.
When their love is felt, nothing is to be gained by politics of protest; I think there could be a decisive war between the two so that they can take out their frustrations.
