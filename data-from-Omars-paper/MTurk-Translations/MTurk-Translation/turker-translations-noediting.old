The role of European Union for the peace in Middle East
Officially European Union plays a decisive role in the mediatory efforts taken for stopping the war in Middle East.
According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of Sarkozy are helping hands in this process.
European Union spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said every single step which may help in delivering the conjoint message of European Union to fighting parties is appreciable.
Officially everything seems fine.
But in fact European Union is portraying a picture of internal tension, stress and strain.
The role of Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak
plus internal affairs has made her helpless.
On the other hand the course of action of French President Sarkozy depicts that France is still the President of European Union.
Although 6 months Presidency tenure of France is over.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role which he is capable of, but he isn't the authority.
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner is facing the funniest side.
He is in the delegation which is led by Schwarzenberg the Foreign Minister of Czech Republic.

Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend herself, while according to Kouchner war is not the defense. Germany has also sent a special ambassador to Middle East. As long as European Union does not show unanimous stand, she can not be successful on diplomatic front.
The prove is the no lift conduct of Israel to mediatory efforts of European Union.
This is the best time for European Union to prove herself, as America has failed in Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.

Why is there decrease in exercise with increase in age?
New Research.
Exercise is good for health in any age.
This makes your heart stronger, decreases cholesterol levels, helps in reducing weight, helps stop diabetes and decreases the chances of Alzheimer's.
Unfortunately, a lot of people tend to exercise less with age.
Experts say that exercises keeps our mind and body alert, and affects the real age of a person.
According to the American Medical Association, not getting enough exercise can lead to numerous health issues.
Dr. Patricia Paylekka of the Mew Clinic of Minnesota reports that with increase in age, exercise is a major factor in determining proper body functioning.
Dr Patricia teaches Medicine in Mew Clinic.
She has done extensive research on older age and the ability to exercise with increasing age.
A team of doctors used High Frequency rays to determine the functioning of the heart.
In which, the ability of the heart to pump blood, and it's ability to shrink and relax was researched.
Experts have concentrated mainly on the left side of the heart which is mainly responsible for the pumping of blood.
They discovered that with increase in age, the problems in the rate of heart relaxation also increase.
Dr. Patricia says that with increase in age, the problems in the heart relaxation rates increases and thus effects the ability to exercise with growing age.
Dr. Carwin Cain was also part of this research.
He says that it's surprising to see the permanent effects of improper exercise on the heart.
In some instances, blood pressure is a factor in heart anomalies and heart diseases.
If doctors and patients can work together when it comes to heart diseases, then they can enjoy the benefits of exercise even with older age.
There has been a detailed report about this in the American Medical Association Publication.

May God bring people's dialogue pleasantness and bring Barack as blessing to world
Well there is no hope but see what Pakistan-America relationship brings to us in the result of this change
Thats the Wish of martin the king human right activist, who wnated to make the world a peaceful place
Obama's (whose name has Hussein also), oath as a President of America on one hand is historical while on the other hand is a hard test too
not only for him but for all those people who has supported him heartily.
This will also be a test for white people majority as it is not easy for them to accept heartily the presidency of black on them.
Here in Southern Asia specially Muslims who have developed expectation from him must remember that he has been elected as President of America and Obama must remember that President of America is Practically the president of the whole world.
From now a little bit later a person whose is a servant has been bought to America from their countries and whose blood and sweat has strong urge to do holy war is today American 24th president.
For one about several persons are depending on him.
It is necessary for people who likes him not to have over expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds in lowering race, religion and other differences then it will be a victory for people who love him.
Due to this change what would be effect on Asia due to this question whether there would be a change in american policies
What will be the effect of these changes on relationship between Pakistan and America
BBC
Whether its Mr Obama  or any other throught out the world
And whereas Pakistan is related recently on issue of bombings on mumbai . India, Israel and America have lost peace is in front of the world
After formation of Pakistan also all the prospects of south was under walis south which had a single rule.
It had given Pakistan for a period to rule south
But tragically our government behaved with south as step mother.
In south after the end of wali south rule there were no increase in schools
And also there showed no interest in their developments.
Presently the girls seeking education went down.
Targeting of educational institutes is continued by local Talibans in NWFP Province of Pakistan.
Most schools are destroyed in Swat majority of those are of girls.
Not only this Taliban has announced a ban on girls education.
Thousands of students (boys and girls) are unable to get education.
What do you think Talibans wants to achieve by stopping women education.
Why the government has failed to stop these illegal actions?
In your opinion what government should do.
Question must be this that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
Because Swat people has understand the game that army is there to serve Taliban not to kill them otherwise how five schools can be destroyed in a single night during curfew, how people can be butchered and hanged in the square.
When government writ is unable to implement in Swat in these circumstances how the government will succeed in eliminating these illegal activities.
Now the question is when government has every thing like armed force, latest weapons, latest technology and spy system then why these Taliban can;t be controlled?
The only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught.
The essence is that these Taliban are paving the path for 'International Imperialism' by their bad deeds.
from now fifteen years back Afghanistan was facing a war
ISI had control over Taliban. which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
then there were sudden changes by which the activities of Taliban came to light.
ISI received dollar offerings from America there by close friends turned to enemies.
the results are this the war is still continued. but in reality Pakistan is helped by Iran, India and Russia
It is a human mistake of doing wrong by not doing what is right.
If a thief robs a place, then he is in danger to rob the same place and same time tomorrow as well. If he fears god and man, he will not steal.
Similarly,  Israel should realised that it is a wrong thing to have bloodshed in Gaza.
Greetings!
The question is whether war, armed movements and   terrorism are the answer to our problems?
If not then what is that chemical prescription that   will take us to the solution of these problems?
This extremist path of war does not solve our problems  but increases them.
In their movements, Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq should  take the path that Nelson Mandela took in South Africa  as a model.
That means political and inner struggle are more   important than armed struggle.
From the participation of Kashmiris in elections it   can seen that they have accepted this point-of-view.
The Israeli  attacks on Gaza still continue in the third week and the death toll have reached to one thousand.
In spite of international diplomatic efforts ,yet it did not reach to cease-fire.
According to an estimate,since the attacks started on 27 December to uptill now,90 thousand Palestinian left their homes and have been migrated to the safe areas.
On the other hand relief organizations said by accusing Israel of dereliction of duty toward the protection of Palestinian children ,that the one entire generation of Palestinian children has become victim of serious psychological and emotional difficulties.
what do you say?
What should be done?

Be aware if taliban started the real jehad then who will slaughter the innocent people?
Who will put girl's school on torch?
And who will hang people at poles by nominating as American spy having no ransom from them after kidnapping.
No nation or religion has dammaged Islam so far then these talibans.
Persian era.
Kohat Pakistan
If the whole Islamic world just threat Israel for launch of attack you will see that in how much pain father of Israel America will be in
and not only talks about real ceasefire rather ceasefire will be accomplished.
But what to do our Muslim leaders lack the courage greatly.
Some one ask Ahmadinejad to take the initiative because your bravery is very popular in BBC Forum.
The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights does not rest with the Arabs or the Muslims of the world alone but is the obligation of the entire world community to raise their voice against tyranny.
This dreadful incident is the worst amongst the crimes committed by Bush.
Just like in Pakistan and India at the end of the financial year on 30th of June, the governmental institutions are pillaged; the American establishment before the expiry of its term gave a green signal to Israel to do whatever she wants.
On the one hand, America says that a ceasefire will be attempted.
On the other hand, the United Nations is accepting petitions and more petitions, but in reality it's nothing. This means only one thing, that even the United Nations is in on the conspiracy against muslims.
All Muslim nations should disregard the United Nations, and unite under their own weight.
We have a lot of examples in front of us. Where America and United Nations are only passing petitions, the Muslims are bearing the brunt of it.
What is the use of this probaganda when BBC is not going to publish it.
Now where are all the journalism principles. When it comes to muslims blood BBC seems to take its eyes off the reality.
By the way self proclaimed leader of rights.
Pubslishing something from their own sounds far, they even din't publish the discussions.
On be half of the muslims
They say that in the World you are very much difference  By Remining Muslims you and other muslims are in martyred direction and they say all about the muslims
there will not any words to translate in this column...
A BBC forums said there will never be suicide attacks in India and also never terrorism in front of a particular faith in the target.
In the extremism word Anti-Islam remarks of his life.
The extremists who is the comments of the above you are not terrorism to send to the particular target
When would our Muslims learn that demon could not be fought with sword.
After seeing the bombardment of Israel in which innocent people unarmed heart cries tears of blood what to do?
But the root cause is this that in the name of killing people which gives a bad impression on Islam
When Palestinian heads had accepted Israels existence then what is the necessary for himas to attack Israel with rockets or committing suicide attacks.
This type of behavior is against humanity.
Then we have a view of America and other countries supporting Israel.
God bless all Muslims to be one, 'Ameen'
And main terrorist should be prosecuted for their painful activities because the main work is done by him.
Or else will terrorist be able to do on such a great level of terrorism and who is behind this everyone knows.
In this situation in easy language it could be denoted as mafiasm
Hitting people hard and leave them to cry.
Although medicines for the wounded, shrouds and compensation money for the dead are being provided by the Arab Rulers but it is being asked.
What should be done about Israeli attacks?
The problem is that the heads of state of all the muslim countries including Saudi Arabia are in a deep slumber. Neither do they have an army nor any defensive strategy. All they think of is that by giving aid, they have fulfilled their obligation.
They should immediately take practical steps against Israeli aggression.
Like placing an embargo on the oil to European countries and America but alas they ......
Greetings to all brothers and sisters!
In my opinion, telling Hamas to quit in the name of peace now, would be an injustice to thousands of widows and orphans.
If the Israelites and their supporters are at a rise, then soon Moses shall be born, as this is the law of nature. America and Israel work as gunpowder amongst suicide bombers in Muslims.
The power drunk elephants do not understand this.
Abu Abdulla: Pakistan.
Hamas and Israel should reconcile so that this bloodshed comes to an end.
Muhammad Sarfraz, Paris, France
Absolutely true.
Let’s suppose that Hamas is really the righteous one and they have waged Jihad against the tyranny to become successful in the divine court, even then they should at least realize that if good brings harm to the people then it is of no use
Those who claim to love God, his Messenger, and their religion; it becomes an integral part of their faith to love humanity.

Brothers, the fate of the murderer of innocent children is annihilation.
But my request to my friends is that Israelis, who had no refuge until yesterday, are now so powerful today that they don't pay heed to what the world says because the Jews are one.
They are not divided into Shiites and Sunnis but they are all Jews and have made progress in every field of life, built everything.
On the contrary, what is the condition of the 55 Islamic states?
They are lagging behind in every field and now they are so helpless that they are at the mercy of their enemy and are just waiting for their death.
now there is a need for America that all the Muslims combine and collect evidences against Israel.
Pakistan ،Feroz magsi، Jhang،
And better than this would be that israel should be investigated and teach them good and let the world in peace.
Muslims have plenty of land and resources.
There is need to be used properly.
One of the shameful situation is this that there wound be no compromise between Himas and Alfath.
famous personalities like Yasser Arafat and Sheik Yasein were been assassinated very diplomatically  for Mosque Aksa fighting for 'Jihad(holy war)' could be weakened this could have been done only by assassinating Yaseer and Arafat.
The world is watching how after these two leaders Palestinians second by second scattering
and how Jews second by second strengthening their positions
In 1974 a Pakistani Prime Minister was of such an International trust that first time in history he united all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance.
Today on his 81st birthday is it hard enough for the nation to promise for unity with each other
but by eliminating the differences between other Muslims will accomplish its (establishment of Islamic Common Wealth) incomplete mission.
This is the Jin which has grabbed the Palestine by half a century.
This Jin has many mouths.
Many times this Jin converts the attention and pressure of the World by calling bad names to himeself from his own or from any other mouth.
And other mouth of this Jin is eating humen beings in Iraq,Afghanistan,Iran and in Pakistan.
And this Jin is the most anoid with Islam than any other,because it knows that whenever it had turned out,it would have been only and only by Islam, Muslims, and complete faith of Muslims and by practical Islam.The history tells that Islam has taken many people like Abu- Jehal on the right path.
Israel With air attack bombarded on Gaza and also attacked missiles since 27th December
Due to these attacks more than 300 Palestinian civilians are dead
After air attacks now Israeli tanks and with other military vehicles of land inspection have reached the border of Gaza
UNO Security Council in Emergengency meetings have declared it as not good and guided Israeli and paestinians to stop the inspections
Hence Israeli officials have said that they would continue this inspection until they are confident about Israel not targeted by rocket attacks
In your opinion is this right for Israel to say about this inspection is to protect Israel?
In this situation is the world organization playing its role?
Is this situations due to uprising situations in Israel?
Is America after having the new President Bari Obama will there be any good in conditions in west?

What to highlight and which news is given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
Now In this regard our Pakistani print and electronic media, specially few Urdu newspapers and columnists etc. are not behind in the trade who in the coverage or writing of increasing terrorism exaggerate to hell.
The United Nations said that apparently the Human Rights and Peace tells Muslims, but it is working on the oppression and coercion and extremists. The mouth of the words that are listening to see the Hamas attack when closed. This into the contested fraud.
The Muslim is huddled cruelty so that if people like امريکہ Supported the Jews, to clean of God, said that This nation of ذليل of the nation and his life will be the nation perfectly normal If you can not plaintiff life if courage to امريکہ is behind the و backing and ديکھنا then that took place, and the زندگى-
All these world renowned leaders and people who murder innocents in the name of peace should realize that peace in the world can only be achieved by justice, and not through injustice or wiping entire races.
If killing a particular race off completely is the answer, then Hitler's plan would not have seen any jews survive, and definitely not seen their rise.
Says a poet
Injustice is injustice. If it breeds, it dies.
Blood is blood. If it bleeds, it dries.
How can anyone define terrorism?
Isn't all this terrorism too? Why does only ones pain seem painful?
Aren't other people human too? So why is only Muslim blood so important? Wasn't all the innocent people's blood red too?
So why are there no disapproval messages now?
I watched the Mumbai attacks investigations like the fire was in my own home. I cannot watch this human suffering. Can't everyone else see this suffering? I wish Muslims all over could come together and think about this.
Bodies on load without anyone to see wounded and blooded innocent faces how does not get words to describe
it is pity on the position of Muslims at one side if people are killed in India then the whole without evidence tells Pakistan to investigate or else we would do it
And other side Israel wants to end Muslims and world is quiet this is unacceptable
God has light not darkness and when this darkness ends then.
The threat to Israeli sovereignty is a joke as long as it has America's backing.
As far as elections are concerned, it is not surprising that the people who are in power do such things to win the heart and mind of people especially in a state like Israel. And speaking of Barak Obama, history shows that no American president has wavered from the policy and will not do so in future. A tyrant is a tyrant whether he is white or black.
It appears from the conversation of forum that everyone is grieved over Benazir death but as politician her mistakes are not forgotten.
It is debatable that Benazir died for democracy or for power.
If she sacrificed for democracy then why she left democracy in the dictatorship of Musharraf for 10 years till she got a deal and American clearance?
Benazir did not return Pakistan when dictatorship affected people needed her she returned Pakistan when she has the assurances of free from cases and of power.
No one is going to say anything about the way that this historical figure is being falsely accused.
Sana Khan.
Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them.
One more writer.
Sir/Madam, maybe if you read not only the history of Pakistan, but of it's neighboring four countries, or of seven other countries, then you might understand the meaning of Mr. Psycho.
Tariq Abbas
One whose nature is wrong cannot be taught.
For reflection in water is not always clear.
Britain never let them become one, and invented the hindu-muslim friction which was taken ahead by sir Syed.
Psycho.
So relentless is our nation, that they are blind when writing poetry for their parties, but no one says anything when our historical figures are battered and falsely accused.
We have progressed enough.
Sana Khan.
Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey doesn't become a scholar if you put books on him.
Though the attack in Mumbai diturbed the talks between India and Pakistan, it is said that the talks would still continue between them
If the talk is about war, then there will be many loss of human lives.
During the Mumbai city attack, India said that a letter had been sent by Pakistan. Also, when extremists were captured, it was found that the this attack was well engineered by four party
First of all Bahan Saheb and to all Christian friends happy Christmas.

War itself is a problem

Hungry and despair will be given tomorrow
Because we are all humans
its better if wars postphones
In your and our gardens
its better if lamp glows
The relations between India and America are now deep rooted and India certainly wishes that if the time comes, America shall betray Pakistan blatantly.
This is also the history of America.
Though in case of an attack by India, America will achieve her goals and the expenditure will all be that of India.
Pakistan should clearly state that they will not take the initiative but if any aggression is waged, then the talk of peace and ceasefire will only take place either after India’s complete destruction or its capture, even if this happens at the cost of their lives.
This is exactly what Islamic history is.
Before this resolution Pakistani people and army has delivered their message.
Indian struggle for having unusual diplomatic and military benefits in compensation of Mumbai attacks are proving her cunning party then affected. Therefore the world has reduced its pressure on Pakistan contrasting to its initial hard reaction.
UN has expressed faith on Pakistani efforts ignoring the unnecessary lamentation of India and Interpol's appreciation of Pakistani efforts is the 'side effect' of unwanted Indian diplomacy.

The day is not far when in UN resolution of Army intrusion in Pakistan will be approved just like the one against Jamat Aldawa.
Riaz Ahmed Farooqi
First our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in UN,
and suppose if this resolution took time to approve then considering the example of America any country will launch the attack at her own.

The extremists gives support to the cruelty of united stated. But this looks like a brutal action against the tribal tradition.
The tradition of the Mantel Lucrative tribals have said not to take brutal action in the name of Islam
In my opinion our army, people will get the people.
They are the move, a copy of this time, so take the laser, the timetable for, so, but they will be on the occasion, and they go there, there are also have the darn cycle.

Friend Feel shy about a person removed from a coffin and tied to a poll just for raising his voice against injustice but have more considerations for box office reviews.
For the success of Operation Sherdil and across the border the success of Operation Lion Heart depends on the favor of people.
It is carried out by American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahib is a victim of conspiracy.
In this forum all reviews will be against Taliban, Agencies have been successfully indulged in Taliban and are applying the policies which might change public opinion.
what i only want to ask is when the body was hanging for a whole day what were the army doing were they there to only target civilians all they give their speeches is due to bombing Taliban tanks, there fell a bomb on house resulting death of two children and mother.
whether they dint know about this situation.
Or else having fun.
we fold our hands and request you to please end this game.
atlast above you also there is a master.
The BBC, was asked the question is not enough to write to see the superficialness regret, for example, a question did not present in the Swat 30 thousand army has been to what?
The Taliban of army fight the dead bodies are all day bleeding on electric poles there.
The Green sawati step, the Pakistani army has 100, media, including the BBC, the real world and the reality, is not a good ignoramus.
The Pakistani army drama.
The Swat child is that it is a bloody drama.
Only thing bus to drama.
These Taliban's have spoilt the name of Muslims
Through out the world if Muslims don't tell them Muslims then why would terrorists are found in their territories.
those who become insensitive and people who don't want to work hard take guns and join these groups
Islam has not spread from guns and swords.
be ashamed
Its need is neither in any religion nor in any customs.
All media including BBC gives thier views about taliban and tribal areas by different resources
But nobody knows what the actual situation is. It is we who know about it because we are tribals.
In short this is a game in which CIA, RAW, MUSAD, and our own ISI is involved.There is nothing like taliban or tribal people, they are the negative elements created by these institutions who are spoiling the name of Islam, Taliban, Religous institutes, Pukhtoon nation and Tribals.
Because of this act, head of the Muslims petulance of shame .
I salute  to M.Q.M leader Iltaf Hussein,A.N.P and to the division of the P.P.P for raising their voices against this cancer,named Taliban.
This cancer is creation of Zia-ul-haq,who is gone but he has also destroyed the Pakistan.
But i am hopefull that the present Government will abolish this Cancer.
Mumbai, India after the attacks said that Pakistan behind these attacks, some of the extremist elements.
Pakistan has denied charges and said that he India in the investigation will provide all possible help.
India has said that Pakistan is a list, in which 20 suspected extremists in the name of the given to India, which are required.
Pakistan has said that the list of Jaish-e- Mohammad included in the head of Maulana Masood Azhar detainee and about the Pakistan government is not any information.
Before this, Pakistan president Asif Ali Zardari, rejected the impression that the Western intelligence agencies and the Indian government to Pakistan, the Mumbai attacks have been provided evidences.
The president Ajmal butcher said about not prove that it is still that he Pakistani.
During the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned that relations between India and not revamped until the soil there to the terrorism used to be.
Latest progress and in India and Pakistan cricket team has canceled the visit.

It will be torn apart by Pakistani themselves.
What can you expect after so much internal segregation and rivalry?
However, Jinnah didn't do well with the Muslims from India, and time has already proven that.
Yasmin: Chicago.
Madam, if Jinnah's work was carried forward, then these internal cancer of segregation and rivalry would not have spread, and the muslims in India wouldn't be in the situation they are in now.
It's our fault that after him, no other leader could stand in his shoes.
But if we can't appreciate our heroes, then....
This sector does have a lot of abilities.
God knows when they will come to their senses and use the blessing of unity to make some progress.
Both countries have priests, Shiv sena, RSS etc. that constantly oppose peace.
And these negative forces do not want the sector to make any progress, hence the countries are kept on their toes.
Can you imagine the status of this place in the world for Pakistan, India and China, with just a little bit of unity?
Pakistan is cursed by God for having robbers and thieves as their appointed leaders.
May god never affect our country Pakistan.
Please be open about the facts on the situation, take notice of the warning signs that they will reach the troops.
Besides the matters are not correct coming into NWFP Baluchistan and Sindh and the situation in Karachi is in front of you.
The winner in her country is spokes person, her ambition is to unite the nations.
Or, we have mercy on the form.
I think a last war is the only option.
That's it, enough is enough.
This situation is ""now or never"".
These false acts of cooperation will not solve the problem.
Nor will small terrorist attacks in each others countries.
Afterall, even Europe was founded after the last world war.
And if there had not been a great war, then they would still be fighting back and forth like Pakistan and India.
Almost all of our political parties are agreed on the fact that terrorism and sectarianism should be rooted out of the country.
But our military leadership does not seem sincere in this regard. On one hand they assure America and Europe that they are with them in this war against terror and on the other hand are covertly aiding the Taliban.
We should now ponder and set our direction and choose one path only. Thanks
There is no doubt that the majority of the movement league are from the Tayaba Group, who joined the league after the inception of Pakistan.
However, after that,  this leagues obstructed aid campaigns, and now on India's insistence, United Nations has declared them as the enemy and even the Government of Pakistan is cracking down on them.
In my opinion, if these Jihadi groups quit this religious fanaticism, and try helping instead, then it would be better for all.
The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan are employing professional criminals in the name of Jihad, the mentors of these and the mullahs are the same people who called Pakistan, Paleedistan and what not from time to time.
They are not letting any stone unturned in the destruction of Pakistan.
They do not deserve to be called humans let alone muslims.
Without rooting these miscreants out of Pakistan, the national security will be at risk.
Is there still room for consideration whether these scoundrels should be banned?
There is no place in this world for extremist mullahs whose only purpose is to kill.
Heart is breaking into pieces on this news.
What world is this where it is hard to survive for the one who names an important part of Allah's religion Islam.
Non Muslims can kill Muslim, but if Muslim even tries to take revenge then along with the whole non Muslim world our hypocrite leaders also treat the ones sincere with true and sincere religion like they are treating our great leader Hafiz Saeed now a days.
As a penalty of Mumbai attacks India.
Pakistan relations are affected, and the recent improvement of relations between two countries is enormously shocked.
India has been continually blaming active armed and unarmed groups in Pakistan
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the action against these groups.
Whereas Indian Security agencies has directly blamed Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks
, in this regard Jamat Adawa has also been nominated.
It is not the first time that because of any terrorist attack the relation of these two countries are worsen.
In December 2000 after the attacks on Indian Parliament both countries were at the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashkr e Taiba was banned and was included in terrorists list.
Now Jamat Adawa, to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of Lashkr e Taiba, is demanded to be banned.
What do you think, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against active extremist groups on her soil?
Can by banning Jamat Adawa present India,
Pakistan crisis will vanish and to what extent it is vital to ban armed groups for establishing forever peace between the two countries.
The UN Security Council on the party Al-qaeda banned, the end of the Security Council, what are the evidence seems so hurry?
What the Security Council against Muslims endorses such activity is not showned?
To say that the plaintiff slow are witness mercurial!
India, itself has become a failed government!
The army, intelligence  and other security institutions have failed, the terrorists who hands may carry 72 hours of the Defense Department was Round and its failure of India accused Pakistan of put and the entire world.
A pagan killed the should be a noise around the world are bandaged. this song huddled?

Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
Our prophet (directives for), scholars and all the saints love the people and gave respect to them, Islam remains a  peaceful religion.
The Muslims have also progressed on war grounds.
When this beautiful  anarchy  climed deen started then MOMIN and pagan fulfill their dreams of violence and the opening new chapter started first aware of the 'not.
The passion is to be saluted. ut try your riches in the action
This do not come during the falling
If this irritates, India should give the proofs
Isn't the river tame not grouped
All of us who are accused should put on the river tame
Does this banning of groupism apply for people in India who are extremist and other organisations?
The entire world is of terrorists
What about in India?
What is Israel?
The Islamic world is considered to have groupisms and are fighting
Pakistan is now in it's last stages.
Kamran Hassan: Abu Dhabi
Your words touch the heart, and the situation seems so.
Now in American publications, the new map of Pakistan is being printed, and all these restrictions are now apparent in the series of events.
The Americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over Pakistan.
In this situation, if we do not stand together and show our unity, then remember, if Bangladesh can be made, then anything can happen.
Terrorist attacks should be condemned to the maximum, whether they are on the Mumbai Hotel or the Marriot Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine.
Similarly, terrorists should be hunted down irrespective of their nationality and whether they are Pakistani, Indian, American or Israeli.
Now the question is that every day terrorist attacks take place in Pakistan, hundreds of people die but the Pakistani officials along with the rest of the world stay silent.
Wasn’t the attack on the Marriot Hotel an act of terrorism?
Then why...?
Appreciation for Interior Advisor Rehman Malik, Masha Allah he has become very brave!
According to BBC on one hand (a committee of) Security Council of UN has banned Jamat Aldawa, on the other hand Mr. Malik says we didn't impose the ban and if it is to be done will be after through research.
Not this, according to BBC Mr.Malik has strongly denied the impression that arrest of terrorists are taking place because of 'someone's instructions'
Highly appreciated!
Keeping Talents or not keeping talents why would not be it said.
We Palestinians are fighting a war for this.
And also its our policies we try to save them.
No one has the right to interfere in any countries affairs.
We cant notice the reign of good.
If people has right view of justice or strengthens on independence respect southern institutions and not help any captain or soldier they there will be definitely peace in Pakistan which is not liked by politicians.
Pakistan is always following European and American purposes.
This goes on without the approval of many of its citizens.
And it invokes hostile sentiments.
If you believe in the United States of America, then why not just give up your place and leave honorably?
Pakistan has the ability to be armed or unarmed.
Security forces raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
Pressure is being increased on Pakistan for taking rapid action against extremist organizations after Mumbai attacks.
India blames Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Secretary Condolisa Rice asked Pakistani leadership to take practical measures for instant and transparent action against the responsible s of Mumbai attacks.
She says that no doubt the extremists responsible for Mumbai attacks used Pakistani soil.
During this Peshawar Government says that unknown armed persons has set another truck stand for supply of goods to Allied Forces deployed in Afghanistan on fire, due to which more then fifty vehicles are destroyed.
It is the second attack on Neto and American supplies during 48 hours in Peshawar.
During this Pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from Karachi to Tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action.
It is revealed that during the reign of General Zia ul Huq because of the invasion of the ex USSR in Afghanistan and its resistance started by the American and Saudi funding resulted in the birth of armed groups of which Pakistan unable to terminated could not get back herself to the era before 1980s.
The question is does Pakistan want to do it?
Is Pakistan capable of doing this?
What do you think?

I have got a single question from all of the human right champions.
It is impossible for them to stand infront of you with neclaces if you kill their childeren.
NO TRANSLATION FOUND ON 1184
And now I do have a question for you that if there is any logic,statement or philosphy from the Islamic studies to Eastern and Western studies that permit killing innocent people including Nimazi(prayer offerer Muslim),labourer and job oriented poor workers in revenge of the American attacks?
And if NO,then you need  hard to rectify your point of view.
Peoples were armed at that time it was feared that after Afghanistan, Russia will attack Pakistan so people were armed.
Now when there is the danger of American attack via Afghanistan of which current American President clearly expressed in his presidential campaign then why should we disarm these people?
Only for this that after defeating Pakistani Army America or India may not face any public resistance?
Yes, if any of them is involved in sabotage activities then only Pakistan should take action against him.
But there it is sad government favoring lashkare tayyiba proving indian words true has made pakistan bad.
Najeeb ur rehman seiko, *Lahore* [P@KI$T@N]
if it is believed that lashkare tayyiba is bad then also it is not right to blame Pakistan government.
One more question is this that this terrorists has not received any help from a government or non- government Indian.
Are terrorists are only born and bought up in Pakistan and don't they come from India or around the world?
As for as Lashkr e Taiba is concerned ongoing terrorism is not linked to it.
It must be recalled that Hafiz Saeed was the first 'Militant Leader' who declared activities of Taliban 'revolt'.
I am quite sure that Taliban agitation is a vital part of American plans so every person or organization must be eliminated who challenges Taliban in any aspect.
Despite the cooperation of the whole nation action against Lashkr due to the pressure of India indicates the nervousness and flatterness of Zardari and Co.
To terminate the expedition started by the American and Saudi funding, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society.
Also protest them that by what ethics American and Saudis are spreaded dangerous arms and so called Jihadi but in fact the virus of  loathsome literature and culture, due to which human butcher houses established in our country.
After the threat of an attack from the Indian side, an announcement from the Pakistan Army that they would pull their troops from the Afghan Border and would commit them towards India and a declaration from Taliban that they would take care of the Afghan Border, staggered the Americans badly and thus put all their weight behind Pakistan against an Indian attack.
This exposed the might of the American Army in the region.
Although India neither made any threat of an attack nor she had the courage to do so.
In addition, attacks of Taliban on the American supply lines proved to be the final nail in the coffin.
Thus, it was proved that without the help of Pakistan Government and Army, America would achieve nothing.
Karachi Business Financial Center of Pakistan is Dubai of underdeveloped areas.
Hundreds of thousand never return empty pocket from here, but since the grip of law has weekend in Western Frontier areas all eyes are on Karachi.
Now they are about to kidnap this city.
First time Pathans are named Pakhtoon, residents of a city are involved in fighting like strangers, although need of the time is unity.
One solution of the problem is that the Urdu speaking people learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu or if everyone learns English, the better.
You will certainly think of the suggestion as absurd, but don’t you think the cause of the conflict is bizarre?
That the cause of clash is language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, during my childhood, I really gave this suggestion on numerous occasions to my friends of all ethnic and religious groups; every time people laughed at it.
At that time, these ethnic and religious sentiments of hatred were not so strong, they were merely boiling inside.
Can't understand what and why it is happening?
Are these the indicators of Dooms day.
By what reason innocents are dieing?
Every one knows the causes those who want to destroy Pakistan are involved and those who commit all this have no religion or country.
Either Karachi or Mumbai it is an inside job.
Every upcoming government gets herself involved in changing the names of places, like now a days airport, roads, buildings all Benazir.
Is this the meaning of Benazir which is happening in Karachi and to the peoples of Pakistan?
In accordance with the Mumbai attack it is said that the the task in Karachi have been failed to perform. And now that these job elements should resign.
The Indians in the Karachi should wake up as the laborers are speaking improperley.
The National parties, political parties, religious parties , linguistic and national parties react in a diplomatic manner for India against the bomb attack
MQM and ANP are responsible for the worse situation in Karachi and administration is not neutral.
Administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately
, police and rangers don't take action because of political parties pressure.
To unite is only expressed in speeches, political parties should have to quit their interests and work for common people.
Till the end administration is under political pressure such incidents will increase, Allah bless Pakistan.
In my openion,these are the biggest terrorrists.
And there must be some foreign hands behind it but do'nt  know which?
But if these circumstances occured in any city of N.W.F.P,then govt. had to do anything against it using all of it's resources but the govt. seems to be helpless when this is not in N.W.F.P.
Govt. should take an army action here saving a big and important city of the country from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will have to face an enormous financial crisis.
BBC Urdu is also under fear. whereas the tax situations in Pakistan is very bad.
BBC Urdu has all the truth.
one of the problem is this Urdu speakers learn pastu or pastu speakers learn Urdu or its better if all learns English.
obviously you would imagine this would be tough but due to due would tough become any simpler?
is language is a problem for communication?
At last another merciless incident in Karachi that was terrifiying every citizen for long.
The media reports are only 50 percent of last four incidents occured there.One did't left any space according to his chances.
Last three nights were sleepless and are still afraid.
To kill the cobblers and dry fruit sellers who tried to emptify the hotels.
They who cut the ears of innocent people and rob at the super highway,are all ignorent of Allah's approach,to whom they will be a victim of one day.
In your perspective what is the reason for bad peace?
(BBC)
Keeping in front of painful mumbai attack of India searching reason for bad peace in Karachi is not necessary but it is straight this only happened because the shed of 'blood'
Its an open secret that if anyone fights with 'father' then 'son' getting out of control is not amazing thing.
Liaqat Ali Khan and many devotees also belonged to there,for correcting the misunderstanding of Mr. Psycho I am quoting a verse
We also will follow our ancestors
sacrificed for her existence and will sacrifice to save her.
Faizan Taufiq Siddiqui
It is very sad, the whole country is at stake while we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui for your kind information if Wikipedia.
org is searched for Liaqat Ali Khan, you will know that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family of an area of Punjab Karnal.
Due to his services for Muhajirs, they consider him their leader.
Every action has got a reaction.
Till our own is bearable but.
Ijaz Awan
Before that you gather a crowd of people giving suggestions over the night,I have to tell you that we can find true evidences of real missbehaving in the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalkings and posters.
We have been bearing both kinds of misbehaviour.
By the way,vegabonds even did not tolerated newly existed Pakistan and its founder.But they have never faced any reaction.
In return,creating problems for the same country,Pakistan
Only Muslim League (N) was left, she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to Peoples Party.
Before this MQM and Muslim League (Q) has already submitted the draft of 18th amendment in assembly and senate.
Till now it appears that 18th amendment was a political move and none of the party is sincere in its approval.
This is why nobody has raised voice in the favor of this amendment in senate or assembly and neither forced the House to approve the amendment.
It seems that by submitted the draft of 18th amendment these parties has beaten around the bushes means they can claim that we had submitted the amendment but the ruling party's speaker did not proceed.
MQM an ally of government, Muslim League (N) secret friend and Muslim League (Q) has approved the 17th amendment, then how is it possible that they are sincere in removing 17th amendment.
It is like painting red to be counted amongst martyred.
Peoples Party is not what so ever in a hurry to remove 17th amendment.
Nobody can think of cutting his own hands.
As long Zardari is President 17th amendment will be there.
It was majority's opinion in our one survey and a fact too.
If 17th amendment ought to be removed then Zardari wont become president.
Now he is more powerful then President Pervez as along with the President he is the Chairman of Peoples Party.
Till he is president 17th amendment is there.
For removing 17th amendment political parties has to depart President Zardari from President house first.
Neither MQM wants it nor the other parties.
Most elders of our family belonged to labor class.
And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.
To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.
Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.
From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.
But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.
We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.
It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God
This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.
It was not even 30 minutes for us working that our younger son said “Dad it feels like I am not born for this job.
We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.
Son started saying that I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work .
Three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home.
What it means is that when a man decides the destination no matter what were the motives behind this no one can stop him from getting it.
But if you don’t even know what you have to do then God be with you.
It is said that don't accuse the dead, but can't help it as we see only evils in her on the first anniversary of Benazir.
On one side Benazir crushed independence movement of Sikhs by handing over the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India for her own sake and on the other hand provided India an opportunity to fully concentrate in Kashmir after crushing the movement in Punjab.
The greed of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years.
During her exile Benazir continued to give negative statements on Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir made a deal with Pervez Musharraf while betraying the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif.
During her reign Benazir provided her husband the opportunity of making money and because of this he popularized as Mr. 10 percent.
Benazir brother was killed during her reign whose assassins are still safe.
Though a woman still Benazir avoided to fight for the rights of women.
Just like Benazir politicized her father's dead body similarly his widower husband politicizing her dead body.
Benazir reigned twice but not only she failed to punish her father's political murder but could not file a case against them.
It has been thirty seven years since the separation  of East Pakistan and look at the height of   insensitivity of our people and rulers that neither   did anyone mourn nor grieved over their mistakes on   that day.
It should have happened that we should look upon 16th   December as a black day and should take appropraite   steps so that this type of accident does not happen   again.
On that day, we send humanism messages to the people  of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to us.
Rulers open the file of Mehmood-ul-Rehman Commission  in order to study the reasons for the separation of  East Pakistan.
They are making strategies to bring back the Beharis   (ethnic class) stranded in Bangladesh and send them  gifts to encourage them.
But we have become so indifferent that when someone  dies in our own neighborhood we don't  know about it.
We are not even concerned about our brothers because  we have become too self-centered.
Even after big tragedies we return to our routine  life the next day.
Perhaps, like East and West Germany were united, in   the same way, East and West Pakistan will also be  united once more.
We can still be united if we are prepared to make   sacrifices for each other and come out of the crust   of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be fulfilled in the   near future
Today when it was told in the news that Governor of American State Illinois has been arrested for charges of corruption
and to remove him from governorship provincial Congress is preparing for his rapid accountability, our American friend who has a keen interest in Pakistani affairs exaggeratedly said to me 'see this is democracy'.
No one is beyond the law in America.
and here is your country Pakistan whose president was dropped of the corruption charges before sworn in.
My sense of humor rouse and I said what's strange if a governor has been arrested in America, in our Pakistan prime minister was arrested overnight and once was hanged and second time was exiled.
Tell me, has it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan the country law breaker has been departed from President House with guard of honor, tell me has it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan Chief Justice has been dismissed as despite of public support he is not reinstated yet, has this ever happened in America?
In Pakistan fake degree holder has become the Health Minister, did this happen in America?
By hearing this American laughed like mads and also accepted his defeat.
In the picture, despite being flanked by Americans from all sides, President Zardari is smiling.
From his joy it looks like
He thinks that the Americans are with his government. What he forgets is that these same people were with Musharraf a year before.
This picture has been taken as it was a family gathering
A photo like this was never published in the papers before; one president with three American officials.
It seems the American involvement in Pakistan has increased and more than one official is needed to do the job; or they are not relying on their new puppet the way they relied on the one before him.
This could also have been arranged keeping in mind the stories of President Zardari’s breach of commitments.
If it had been a sensible ruler, at least he would not have been grinning during the photo session and he would have had a subservient and embarrassing look on his face.
If the principle of democracy is applied on this picture then Present Zardari is in minority.
In democracy, majority rules the country and the picture reveals the actual rulers.
The scenic Swat valley is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
The government’s policy so far is to engage in talks besides the use of force.
But the use of force is achieving nothing other than strengthening the Taliban and increase in public sympathies for them.
What is needed of the government is to address the root cause of this menace instead of using force.
With the root causes addressed, Fazalullah and Taliban will die out themselves.
The Shariat Bill by the ANP government will help to address the problem to a great extent.
But the government must address the financial problems in addition to the implementation of Shariat.
General Musharraf, the rights that his aches that this nation diagonal scientists have activity will be rid of the power, but those who has the intention of changing the interview with CNN
He also to the amadein
The expected actions and the steps arranged was end
When the rule of Bush  was at an end he was scared and he started dealing with theives
General Musharraf, the army had to control, but the present Government not only to what is the.
If it was Bajaur, or Swat the terror was uncontrollable by army.

I'am afraid that pakistani millitary is unable to controll a small group of taliban from entering in there country then how can they fight with india
They are unable to track the non-juduicial F.M channel which is running by taliban,according to me that is very easy.
Then also they didnt took any action against taliban's illegal F.M channel which is spreading poison all over the country or  ruining their country with the help of that channel
After closing the girls schools now they are closing the boys schools too.
They order curfew because talibans can move easily or proceed easily.
Today at night during curfew eight turcks, during curfew they entered  mangora's environ and ENTRENCHED them.
Now the question raises that after being curfewed  then how the talibans entered in .
The Army can kill Akber bagdi at his home but they given salami to taliban
For god sake can anyone make then understand that  help the helpless people of SWAT and release them from the talibans army and prove that pakistani army is strong enough to take action against any one of his enemy.
He says, maximum bloodshed has been done on the base of religion, you tell me in the absence of any religion wont bloodshed occur?
Punjabi, Pathan. white and black, Mehsud and other tribes, are all these created by religion?
Not at all, sir, religion preaches us that there is no white, black, Punjabi or Muhajir, if there is no religion then half of the world would have been destroyed by the war of black and white and remaining half by the war of cast.
Actually religion nourishes human morally and restricts him that he is not here at his own rather is sent by The Creator of Universe and he has to live by God's rules.
As a Muslim I believe that Islam is true religion and a complete code of life.
After moving to London, I used to call my relatives back home every single morning, although they never called us even once. Then I realized they were inconvenienced by our calling as well, so we stopped.
After living in France now for two years, I feel the same way.
I don't know why people always expect us to call them.

It has been proved that this area is from thousands of years is also Israelis country
It should happen that both of the groups should compromise with each other and live in peace but as their relations are in the hands of Arab and western countries, hence without their approval there would be no peace.
Moreover Iran also wants to fight its proxy war from here.
If Israel stops for meantime, then again for some reasons after a while it will start.
The interests of BBC homeland are affiliated to America and Israel and this is why under the wrapper of 'broadmindedness' it has produced a series of blogs consisted of 'Jewish favor' and is conducting one sided and blind 'propaganda'.

We thought Talibans as non - related, that there were just in oppose of education for women.
They show this angerness daily by demolishing scools and colleges of women.
But usually this belief is not been streghtened, According to CNN today monday Taliban has demolished a school for boys.
South, taliban has demolished boys school
Girls Schools according to famous proverb ""Literacy first"" following it was destructed first, Cant understand why people still believe Taliban as irresponsible and nomadic creatures?
from this condition it is clear that it is not proper to quote Taliban as against women literacy.
But by gods grace their totally against literacy.
Allah the great should give this Mujhahideen more power and rule

Lots of people have many reservations about this growing interference of computer like in financial issues.
As you have facilities for using credit cards but by this law enforcement agencies has also firmer grip on your private life.
That just by tracking the record of your credit card you can be exposed.
And in future when use of currency will be minimal its utility will increase.
Similarly in crimes world there is no need to rob the bank, information of credit card are hacked.
Similarly friendship has become computerized
, social networking websites like Orcet, Facebook and MySpace are ranked first in popularity.
But don't you feel that the more closer we are getting of these sites mentally, practically moving further away from people.
Similarly there is the website of match making, where by knowing your choice you are provided with a list of people according to your likings.

Perhaps I received a lesser share of wisdom.
From childhood, I thought of everything as being true if it was told by an elder.
In the same way, I was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world.
I was even ridiculed a lot on this
But only that seemed true which was plausible.
I was always perplexed at the need of telling a lie.
Even suffered in this part of my age because of this
So I tried to keep the lies at a minimum.
I refrained from giving false hopes to others particularly with Allah’s name
And only say God willing when it was my wish that the work was to be done
Besides Allah knows what is there in the hearts.
This is a disgusting problem which rears its head due to the ignorance of the religion.
According to both our religion and the law in Pakistan, infants should remain with their mother.
Their father is responsible for their maintenance allowance and he can meet them.
Then when the kids become mature they can decide with whom they want to live.
You have mentioned correctly that the real problem is the relatives who poison the minds.
Jagirdar thinking on all of our deeds exercises.
Thinking the same thing here working in the property of the father, a new parts and will be opposed the same otherwise his father, the process is commendable and counterfeiting.
Our relationship with the spasm establishments was created the Social abuses.
Related  widow and the concept of marriage is scarce.
The same unessential beliefs and traditions are being due to the anxiety family system.
In our societies if a 50-year-old person or the wife of his wife, her husband if left forward and they should take a second marriage,then why the people didn't see with a good thought.
A Pakistani uncle near to his wife, 10 to 12 years ago were passed away, now all children after their  marriages the uncle too got married to a widow woman ,but his childrens were against them.
In my opinion they have the right? what would be ur opinion?
In my opinion,being alive as her children no one can take the place of our mother we cant tolerate it..like this how many of us believe in this  type of thinking!!!
In my opinion the children of this person should think that after having married all the kids, is there anything wrong in his marrying a widow?
This way the widow gets a caretaker and uncle also gets someone who will take care of his home.
Because his children would certainly be busy in their worldly affairs and would not be having time for him.
The reason behind this is ignorence.
In future what if their wives refused to work for the old man?
This is the outcome of the social pressure.
Childeren feel ashamed on the second marriage of their father when people make jokes of such family on this action.
Where as they must face the circumstances and say that what their father did,it was just according to Islam.
This is a curse in our society in which we are sunk since last 40 to 50 years.
Even a wife is agreed on the unethical activities of her husband but does not allow her for second marriage.
If she had the power She wont allow him of this even after her death.
Along with husband spoils her afterlife too and causes an increase in corruption in society.
The customs of US and Islamabad are not really the same as said by the tourists
Like that of the the culture of the girls, education, marriages etc.
The question is that, the widow of the house have a abdominal contraction again.
In IndopPak we embraced Islam centuries ago but can't get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then Islam.
Second marriage of man as ridiculous, divorce as stigma, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as disgrace and man's marriage with an elder woman as the result of her cunningness is all because of such thinking.
Moreover to copy the western nations we declare veil and worship backward.
It was easy to embrace Islam to get rid of such thinking is very difficult.
Allah bless us all the courage for it.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never that difficult.

The wife of famous singer Adnan Sami reached went to police station for blaming him of torturing her
, police has advised her to consult the court.
Saba Galadari wife of Adnan Sami has filed an application against him that Adnan Sami continuously tortures her
and behaves inhumanly,
Now she is fed up of this therefore case must be filed against him
, in place of filing case police asked her to consult the court by saying that this case is not under the jurisdiction of police.
In your opinion the blame of Adnan Sami's wife on him is true?
Is it not an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Do inform us with your opinion in this regard.
Adam Sanghar, Meher
As far as the allegations are concerned, anyone can levy them on any other person.
There is nothing superior to honor.
Whatever is the current state of relations between Adnan Sami and his wife, Adnan Sami left his respectable life and went to India to earn a fortune. The same fame has now importuned him.
It is the outcome of his wrong doings.
Washington
American high officials have stated that President Obama will take a stern attitude towards the Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
The new American strategy towards Afghanistan will focus on war instead of development
The officials said that Hamid Karzai is being viewed as an obstacle in achieving American interests in Afghanistan because of government corruption and drug trafficking is on the rise and the Talibans are gaining strength
The American officials also said that those people in the current administration who are pressurizing Hamid Karzai to do more include, Vice President Joe Biden and American Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrook
They stated that the policy change came after President Bush left office, who used to have video conferencing with Hamid Karzai fortnightly and emphasized the American role in the rebuilding of Afghanistan and its civil institutions.
The Obama administration will work with provincial political leaders instead of the central government.
They said that they will ask Hamid Karzai to intensify the campaign against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing new elections this year and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his administration are going to back him up in the presidential race.
Does this statement reflect a shift in American policy towards Afghanistan?
Is Hamid Karzai’s era coming to an end?
What is your say on this?

Sir Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan for playing one day international series.
Visit of a foreign team to Pakistan, in spite of Pak India tension is a good sign.
On reaching Karachi Airport the Sir Lankan team was given a warm welcome.
Two matches will be held between Pakistan and Sir Lanka in Karachi while the third one will be played in Lahore.
Both teams are asserting highly regarding their batting, bowling and fielding.
If Siri Lanka venerates its spinners, Pakistan’s reliance is on its fast bowlers.
Sir Lanka’s captain Mahela Jayawardene says that no one player but the whole Pakistan cricket team is dangerous.
Muralidharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, while Pakistan’s captain says that this competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik has said “we have played Murali Dharan before and will take care of Mendis as well. We have made a secret game plan and will reveal it on the ground”.
Will the Pakistan and Sir Lanka series live up to claims of being interesting and thrilling?

All this is done by these people. Kashmir is fighting for its freedom from past 60 years.
those who have not asked about it have now themselves in deep violence. talks of comprise has been started
first killed Muslims openly now heading for cover it
anyways Pakistan should understand their double policies.
Asad Khan: London
India is making situations so that the Kashmir situation is overlooked.
But Pakistan has always shown India's true face to the world.
Even the British government is now understanding this, that is why India is now ruining Pakistan's reputation by terrorism accusations to distract from the Kashmir situation.
And hesitates to talk with Pakistan about this.
Britains Secretary of State David Miliband said that resolving Kashmir issue will finish off the extremism and the government of Pakistan will be able to tackle the dangers faced at the border efficiently
It should be noted that recently the newly elected American President Obama has also expressed similar thoughts on the Kashmir issue
Britains Secretary of State said in front of media in Mumbai and also wrote that the idea of war against terrorism is wrong.Killing people  for the sake of threats being faced had been the policy of President Bush
David Milliband said that Pakistan should not have any soft corner for the extremist groups
Is India creating uncertainity in the region to avoid the resolution of Kashmir issue by big powers?
Are the Mumbai attacks the part of the plan?
Does India want to avoid the comprehensive talks by on the basis of terrorism?

I think that they get problems often in a while and they start threatning Pakistan.
We are ready from each aspect.Indian army chief should better shut his mouth up else we are capable to cross attacking.

Raas Al Khaima, It is due to America that wrong statements are being given , America is out of its mind but now India is also doing the same, India should try attacking , then it will become crystal clear that who stands where.
Israel is attacking Hammas but nobody has that much integrity to stop them. India also want to follow Israel's foot steps
Prime Minister Syed YOusaf Raza Gillini said that the newly elected vice president Joe Biden had played an important role in steping down of previous president musharraf as army cheif and restoring crippled democracy, thats why the government of pakistan has awarded him with Sitare-e-Imtiaz (honour medal)

This marks the anxiety of the Mazhar facets
How does the attitude of India towards threatening?

It is extremely sad that the Israelis are openly killing Palestinians. Over here, Kashmir is in the same situation but the Peace Council does not even turn a ear over it.
All the groups that are in Kashmir and Palestine, should keep the war going for freedom, and unitedly fight any force that opposes them. One day their martyrdom will bear fruit, God willing.
Israeli air attacks are still continued on Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
The important leader of Hamas Nazaar Rayyan and family has been martyred.
The Security Council session ended without any decision.
America has opposed the censure resolution against Israel submitted by Lebia and other Arab countries in the session.
Israeli airplanes bombardment is continued since many days on Palestinian civil population.
The whole world reacted on Mumbai attacks but no country including America and England can see bloodshed caused by Israeli attacks.

I think the actual point that the majority of our nation in illetrate. They even dont   know where their money is going to. Government  is interested in applying taxes and fullfil their duties. Electricity and Gas shortage will remain same.
Because who are elected by public are very well known
The crisis of electricity and gas has worsen in whole of the Pakistan
, on the other hand gas prices have been raised by average 8, while in few cities unavailability of petrol created immense worry for people.
Intense reactions, riots and torturous demonstration are continued in the industrial and business circles of Pakistan against the crisis of electricity and gas.
Industrialists have threatened a shutdown ultimatum.
In Karachi people are worried due to 8 to 10 hours load shedding.
Industrial sector is almost paralyzed.
Government Institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other.
Increasing the prices of electricity and gas is not a joke with people?
Why the solutions of the problems are not considered?
Is government not seeing the full stop on national development?
What steps you will instantly recommend for managing this crisis?
Let us know your opinion.
Imran Khokar from Madīnah Munawwarah, “I would like to say that rulers are a reflection of society’s morality.
I am surprised that a government claiming to be people’s friendly is unfriendly to the people.
Non-Availability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a menace.
The government does not have any control over the institutions.
The law and order situation is worsening day by day. May Allah have mercy on the country.
It's beginning of a new year.

Will Pakistani courts end?
what will be the relations between Indo - pak?
Is there any situation of immediate wars?

I remember an interview of adnan sami in which he said that I am not a Pakistani, my nationality is British.
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan in first chance because he is not to be respested there as well

Indians got a change in their attitude after Mumbai attacks
Jugjeet singh started hating Pakistan and Pakistanis as its reaction.
The point to ponder is that Adnan Sami has sang songs with Aasha Bhonsle.So he is not a bad voiced singer.Adnan Sami should stay in India,no need to come there.

Regarding Jagjit Singh I would tell that he changes colors like a chameleon .
The one who is taking care of situation gives opinion about it.The people of pakistan open up your eyes and see that you are greatly respected in India.Understand their feelings.
After the Mumbai attack their feeling of hate has increased.Now they are talking against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to foreign news agency the situation has become funny when President Bush along with Prime Minister Noor Almalki in press conference at his office in Baghdad when an Iraqi journalist said to President Bush, ""Dog, this is farewell kiss"".
After this journalist removed his shoe and threw it at Bush, President bush expertly moved his head out of the way and saved himself.
Second shoe hit the American flag.
Security officials dragged him out of there.
On this occasion President Bush said I don't know why he did this, shoe was of size 10, I was not bothered.
Do you think that this action by the journalist depicts the anger of Iraqi people against President Bush.
What will you say about this?

But it's also true that they ignored the seniors of their party and nominated their own son as the representative of People's Party.What sort of democracy is it?

Our rulers should understand that the people they are fighting against are our own. Who are taking upon every problem because they love Pakistan
If there would be war then they will fight for Pakistan.
When their love would be felt, just condenming politics will not work. I think between both, there might be going a resulting war.
