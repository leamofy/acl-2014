In order to better resist flu, quit dieting. 
According to the American Scientist this research has come out after many experimentations on rats. 
Experiments have proved that those rats on lower calories diets developed a tendency not to overcome the flu virus . 
This Research has proved wrong the very old saying that it is better to starve a fever. 
According to the scientist a patient should eat more during a fever. 
According to the Researchers of the State of Michigan University dieting rats have less strength to fight infection and their chances of death increased, whereas earlier those rats on a common diet had more strength to fight the flu virus. 
According to Professor Elizabeth Cardener, people on diets will be more susceptible to the flue virus and may also take longer to recover once infected. 
The professor recommends that people who have taken the flue vaccination, discontinue their diet over the summer in order to elude the virus.

Thomas Red,  former director of Cooperation at the National Laboratory Technical Committee of Los Angeles, has written a book. 
Thomas C. Reed and Danny B. Stillman wrote the Book, The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation.  They conclude that the U.S. has tested an atom bomb and may also house nuclear secrets.

The role of European Union for the peace in Middle East 
Officially, the  European Union plays a decisive role in the mediatory efforts taken for stopping the war in Middle East. 
It is the official stand of Brussels, that Schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of Sarkozy offer helping hands in this process. 
Spokesman for European Union, Mr.Amadeu Altafaj said every single step which may help in delivering the collective message of European Union to the fighting parties, is appreciable. 
Everything seems fine, officially. 
But, European Union is, in fact, portraying a picture of internal tension, stress and strain. 
The role of Czech Republic, as the President of the Union, is already weak. 
plus, internal affairs has made her helpless. 
On the other hand, the course of action chosen by the  French President Sarkozy depicts that France is still the President of European Union. 
Although, the 6 months' tenure of Presidency of France is over 
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and  he is quite capable too; but he is not the authority. 
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner faces the most pleasant task. 
He is in the delegation which is led by Schwarzenberg, the Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic. 
In addition, the two foreign ministers are giving different statements on the war in Middle East. 
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend herself, while according to Kouchner war is not the answer.  Germany has also sent a special ambassador to the Middle East. As long as European Union does not show a unanimous stand, she can not be successful on the diplomatic front. 
The proof is that Israel has ignored the EU's diplomatic efforts. 
This is the best time for European Union to prove herself, as American diplomacy has failed in the Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush. 
Financial crisis: German millionaire industrialist commits suicide. 
Adolf Marclay, a resident of Swabia in south Germany has left behind a huge industrial company. 
But he was not well known to German public until recently. 
When he had to negotiate with 30 banks for weeks regarding his debts towards industrial companies, he became big news, and could see the dark future for the Marckay Group. 
Marclay Group had to bear the loss of hundreds of millions of euros after it bought the shares from the known industry, Folks Wigan. 
The financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed one billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on Marclay. 
Recently the same banks accepted to provide a loan to Marclay group on urgent basis. Adolf Marclay who started as a small industrialist, has industrial group's annual income reached 30 billion euros, couldn't bear the the loss in his financial strength. 
After the death of his father, Adolf Marclay took the responsibility of the business. He used modern methods to make his business more successful. 
He named his company Ratiopharm which is now Germany's most successful and biggest pharmaceutical company. 
Until recent times this pharmaceutical company had a budget of around 5 to 6 billion euros and is now earning around 8 billion euros annually. After the great success of Rasue farm the Marclay Group bought many big industries such as Hi-Del Barag Cement, a manufacturer of construction equipment as well as Kassbohrer, a good car maker. 
Marclay Group has a employee number of around 100 thousand around the world and among its industries, Rasue Farm has always been given special importance. 
Adolf Marclay has said this many times in his life. """"We have been in pharma business since four generations"""". 
Now the industry is handled by his children and I hope that it continues to progress for a few hundred years by our family. 
After the suicide of Adolf Marclay,the banks have given approval of temporary loan of 400 million euro for his group VEM, but on the condition that VEM has to be sold to Rasio Farm in order to improve the financial position of this group. 
After the death of Adolf Marclay, the Marclay Group will not remain the same as it was before.

Tea: An effective treatment of Lung Cancer. 
New research shows that drinking three cups of tea day 
greatly reduces the risk of the lung cancer in women under the age of 50. 
This research from the Moffet Cancer Centre in Florida says that the chances of contracting lung cancer in women under the age of 50 
who drink tea three times a day, are reduced by 37% 
The research also said that having more than three cups of tea daily in women over the age of 50 has on special benefits. 
Experts believe that the reason behind this is that tea has some elements that are effective against the formation of cancer cells in women mainly under the age of 50. 
More than 5000 women who had lung cancer were treated in the Moffet Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. 
They were aged between 29 to 74. 
Researchers compared their medical records and lifestyles to women who were free of lung cancer. 
Experts also discovered that tea was mainly effective on a certain type of cancer called lopler, and was reduced by 66%. 
Every 10th lung cancer patient falls under this type of cancer. 
This type of cancer is especially dangerous because it is deeper than most, and is usually only discoverable when it has spread significantly. 
Experts say that younger females can greatly reduce the risk of lung cancer by regularly drinking three cups of tea every day. 
They say that incorporating tea in daily life can greatly reduce the risk of any cancer. 
In Britain, more than 40,000 women are diagnosed with lung cancer every year.

Why do people exercise less as they get older? 
New Research. 
Exercise is good for health at any age. 
This makes your heart stronger, decreases cholesterol levels, helps in reducing weight, helps stop diabetes and decreases the chances of Alzheimer's. 
Unfortunately, a lot of people tend to exercise less with age. 
Experts say that exercise keeps our minds and bodies alert, and affects the real age of a person. 
According to the American Medical Association, not getting enough exercise can lead to numerous health issues. 
Dr. Patricia Paylekka of the Mew Clinic of Minnesota reports that with the increase in age, exercise is a major factor in determining proper body functioning. 
Dr Patricia teaches medicine at the Mew Clinic. 
She has done extensive research on older age and the ability to exercise with the increase of age. 
A team of doctors have used high frequency rays to determine the functioning of the heart. 
The ability of the heart to pump blood, and it's ability to shrink and relax was researched. 
Experts have concentrated mainly on the left side of the heart, which is mainly responsible for the pumping of blood. 
They discovered that with increase in age, the problems in the rate of heart, relaxation also increase. 
Dr. Patricia says that with increase in age, the problems in the heart relaxation rates increases and thus effects the ability to exercise with growing age. 
Dr. Carwin Cain was also part of this research. 
He says that it's surprising to see the permanent effects of improper exercise on the heart. 
In some instances, blood pressure is a factor in both heart anomalies and diseases. 
If doctors and patients can work together on the problem of heart disease, then they can enjoy the benefits of exercise even with older age. 
A detailed report concerning this appeared in the American Medical Association Publication. 
According to the Army Chief of India, war with Pakistan is not imminent. 
Indian Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor says war with Pakistan is not imminent; however, it is in the best interests of the country to remain prepared to defend her interests. 
General Kapoor claimed that despite assurances and international pressure following the Mumbai attacks, the terrorism network is not only present in Pakistan but is also active. 
He said this while speaking to correspondents in Srinaga. 
The Indian Army Chief was on a daylong tour of the New Delhi-administered Kashmir, where he viewed the army's border preparations and defense system. 
He was asked his opinion on the reports that Pakistan has denied responsibility for the attacks on Mumbai. 
General Kapoor said that decisions of war and peace are controlled by political leaders. 
Talking about the alleged terrorism network in Pakistan, he said that Indian Army will have to face the forces whose object is to destroy peace and weaken India. 
He said that 700 to 800 militants are present in Indian Kashmir, almost half of them foreigners. 
General Deepak Kapoor said as the weather improves attempts of attack from Pakistan and her side of Kashmir may increase; India, however, has increased security on her borders. 
He refused the chances of reducing the number of deployed army in Indian administered Kashmir by saying that no compromise on country security. 
May God bring people's dialogue pleasantness and bring Barack as blessing to world 
Well there is no hope but see what Pakistan-America relationship brings to us in the result of this change 
That was the wish of Martin Luther King, human rights activist, who wanted to make the world a peaceful place. 
Obama's (whose name has Hussein also) oath as a President of America on one hand is historical, while on the other hand is a hard test too. 
Not only for him, but for all of those people who have supported him wholeheartedly. 
This will also be a test for the white majority, as it is not easy for them to accept wholeheartedly the presidency of a black man. 
Here in Southern Asia, Muslims who have developed expectations of him must remember that he has been elected as President of America and Obama must remember that President of America is practically the president of the whole world. 
From now a little bit later a person whose is a servant has been bought to America from their countries and whose blood and sweat has strong urge to do holy war is today American 24th president. 
For one about several persons are depending on him. 
It is necessary for people who like him not to have excessive expectations of him. 
If Obama succeeds in reducing racial, religious and other differences, then it will be a victory for people who love him. 
Due to this change, what would be the effect on Asia? Due to this question, would there be a change in American policies? 
What will be the effect of these changes on the relationship between Pakistan and America? 
BBC 
Whether it's Mr Obama or any other throughout the world. 
And whereas Pakistan is related recently on issue of bombings on mumbai . India, Israel and America have lost peace is in front of the world 
After the formation of Pakistan, the South was under Wali South, which had a single rule. 
Pakistan ruled the south for a while. 
But tragically our government like a stepmother toward the South. 
In the south, after the end of Wali South rule, no more schools were built. 
They also showed no interest in their development. 
Presently, fewer girls sought an education. 
The targeting of educational institutes is continued by local Talibans in the NWFP Province of Pakistan. 
Most of the schools destroyed in Swat were for girls. 
The Taliban have not only announced a ban on girls' education. 
Thousands of students (boys and girls) are unable to get an education. 
What do you think Talibans wants to achieve by stopping women education. 
Why the government has failed to stop these illegal actions? 
In your opinion what government should do. 
Question must be this that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get. 
Because Swat people has understand the game that army is there to serve Taliban not to kill them otherwise how five schools can be destroyed in a single night during curfew, how people can be butchered and hanged in the square. 
When government writ is unable to implement in Swat in these circumstances how the government will succeed in eliminating these illegal activities. 
Now the question is when government has every thing like armed force, latest weapons, latest technology and spy system then why these Taliban can;t be controlled? 
The only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught. 
The essence is that these Taliban are paving the path for 'International Imperialism' by their bad deeds. 
from now fifteen years back Afghanistan was facing a war 
ISI had control over the Taliban, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran. 
Then there were sudden changes by which the activities of the Taliban came to light. 
ISI received dollar offerings from America; thereby close friends turned to enemies. 
The results are this the war continues, but in reality Pakistan is helped by Iran, India and Russia. 
It is a human mistake of doing wrong by not doing what is right. 
If a thief robs a place, then he is in danger to rob the same place and same time tomorrow as well. If he fears god and man, he will not steal. 
Similarly, Israel should realize that it is wrong to shed blood in Gaza. 
Greetings! 
The question is whether war, armed movements and terrorism are the answer to our problems? 
If not, then what is the chemical prescription that will take us to the solution of these problems? 
This extremist path of war does not solve our problems but increases them.    Our problems are increased by the path of war the extremist take. 
In their movements, Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq should take the path that Nelson Mandela took in South Africa as a model.    Palestine, Afghanistan, and Iraq should follow Nelson Mandala example of the path he took in South Africa. 
That means political and inner struggle are more important than armed struggle.    Neson MAndela showed that political and inner strugle are more important than armed stuggle. 
From the participation of Kashmiris in elections it can seen that they have accepted this point-of-view.    The citizens of Kashmiris have shown their acceptance of this point of view through their perticipation in the election process. 
The Israeli attacks on Gaza still continue in the third week and the death toll have reached to one thousand.    In the third week the Israeli attacks on Gaza continued, the death toll reached into one thousand. 
In spite of international diplomatic efforts ,yet it did not reach to cease-fire.    A ceise-fire could not be reached in spite of diplomatic efforts. 
According to an estimate,since the attacks started on 27 December to uptill now,90 thousand Palestinian left their homes and have been migrated to the safe areas.    An estimated 90,000 Palestinans have left their home and migrated to safer areas since December. 
On the other hand relief organizations said by accusing Israel of dereliction of duty toward the protection of Palestinian children ,that the one entire generation of Palestinian children have become the victim of serious psychological and emotional difficulties.    Releif organization have stated that, through a dereliction of duty to poperlty protect the Palestinian children one entire generation have become victims of serious psychological and emotional difficulties.

The Taliban should be given a chance. 
Basit, Peshawar 
Be aware if the taliban started the real jihad then who will slaughter the innocent people? 
Who will put girls' schools to torch? 
And who will hang people by accusing them as American spy after having no ransom from their kidnapping? 
No nation or religion has damaged Islam as much as the taliban.

If the whole Islamic world were to threaten Israel if it attempted an attack, Israel's mentors in America would be much worse off. 
This will result not in talks about a ceasefire, but a real ceasefire. 
But our Muslim leaders lack courage, so what do we do? 
Ahmadinejad should take the initiative;  he is very popular in the BBC Forum. 
Peace and human rights are not the sole responsibility of the Arabs or the Muslims of the world, but it is the obligation of the entire world community to raise their voice against tyranny. 
This dreadful incident is Bush's worst crime. 
As we saw in Pakistan and India at the end of the fiscal year on 30th of June, the governmental has been pillaged; the American administration has given a green signal to Israel to do whatever she wants. 
On the one hand, America says that a ceasefire will be negotiated. 
On the other hand, the United Nations is accepting petitions and more petitions, but in reality it's nothing. This means only one thing, that even the United Nations is in on the conspiracy against muslims. 
All Muslim nations should disregard the United Nations, and unite under their own weight. 
We have a lot of examples in front of us. Where America and United Nations are only passing petitions, the Muslims are bearing the brunt of it. 
What is the use of this probaganda when BBC is not going to publish it. 
Now where are all the journalism principles. When it comes to muslims blood BBC seems to take its eyes off the reality. 
By the way self proclaimed leader of rights. 
Pubslishing something from their own sounds far, they even din't publish the discussions. 
On be half of the muslims 
They say that in the World you are very much difference  By Remining Muslims you and other muslims are in martyred direction and they say all about the muslims 
there will not any words to translate in this column... 
A BBC forum said that India will never resort to suicide attacks and that a faith will never be targeted. 
In extremism, the word Anti-Islam remarks of his life. 
The extremists who is the comments of the above you are not terrorism to send to the particular target 
When would Muslims learn that you cannot fight the demon with a sword. 
The attack on Israel was very disappointing. Innocent, unarmed died. There's nothing one can do about it. 
Islam kills people in the name of religion. This is the biggest problem. 
When the Palestinian head accepted Israel's existence, there was no need for the Himas to attack Israel by way of rockets and suicide attacks. 
This type of behavior is against humanity. 
America and many other countries support Israel. 
Lets pray to God for all Muslims to be united. Amen. 
Major terrorists should be prosecuted for their hurtful activities because the main work is done by them. 
Otherwise, terrorists will be able to continue on to a higher level of terrorism, and everyone knows who is behind this.    (this = ?  What does ""this"" refer to?) 
In plain language, this situation could be labeled as ""Mafiasm."" 
Hitting people hard and leaving them crying.    (There is no subject of this sentence -- who is doing the hitting?) 
Although medicine for the wounded is being provided, as well as shrouds and monetary compensation for the dead, the Arab rulers had to be asked to provide them. 
What should be done about the Israeli attacks? 
The problem is that the heads of state of all the Muslim countries, including Saudi Arabia, are in a deep slumber.  They have neither an army nor any defensive strategy.  They believe that by giving simple aid, they have fulfilled their obligation. 
They should immediately take practical steps against Israeli aggression, such as placing an oil embargo on European and American countries. 
Like placing an embargo on the oil to European countries and America but alas they ...... 
Greetings to all brothers and sisters!    (Is this part of the article?) 
In my opinion, telling Hamas to quit in the name of peace, now, would be an injustice to thousands of widows and orphans. 
If the Israelites and their supporters are at a rise, then soon Moses shall be born, as this is the law of nature. America and Israel work as gunpowder amongst suicide bombers in Muslims. 
The power drunk elephants do not understand this. 
Abu Abdulla: Pakistan. 
Hamas and Israel should reconcile so that this bloodshed comes to an end. 
Muhammad Sarfraz, Paris, France 
This is absolutely true. 
Let’s suppose that Hamas is really the righteous one and they have waged Jihad against the tyranny to become successful in the divine court. Even then they should at least realize that if good brings harm to the people then it is of no use. 
Those who claim to love God, his Messenger, and their religion; it becomes an integral part of their faith to love humanity. 
After the Muslims around the world camps are totally wiped out to marry,the order of God. 
Rehman helps people who are probably KI (-N find 
No order has been given, but the Islamabad government can order them not to. 
Zoroastrianism questions your jihad against the order. 
Difference in our values cannot be addressed by becoming suicide bombs. 
Brothers, the fate of the murderer of innocent children is annihilation. 
But my request to my friends is that Israelis, who had no refuge until recentlyy, are now so powerful today that they can ignore what the world says because the Jews are united. 
They are not divided into Shiites and Sunnis but they are all Jews and have made progress in every field of life, and have built everything they need. 
On the contrary, what is the condition of the 55 Islamic states? 
They are lagging behind in every field, and now they are so helpless that they are at the mercy of their enemy and are just waiting for their death. 
Now there is a need for America to act so that all the Muslims combine and collect evidences against Israel. 
Pakistan ،Feroz magsi، Jhang، 
And a better way would to investigate Israel and teach them a lesson or two so that the world lives in peace. 
Muslims have vast and and resources. 
There is a need to put them to proper use. 
One of the shameful situation is that there would be no compromise between Hamas and Alfath. 
Famous personalities like Yasser Arafat and Sheik Yasein were assassinated diplomatically. For Mosque Aksa fighting for 'Jihad(holy war)' has to  be weakened  and this could be possible only by assassinating Yaseer and Arafat. 
The world is watching ,  how Palestinians started scattering,  after these two leaders were eliminated. 
and how every second, Jews strengthen their position. 
In 1974, a Pakistani Prime Minister was such an internationally trusted Muslim representative, that first time in the history he united all the Muslim leaders under one roof without exception. 
Today, on his 81st birthday, is it hard enough for the nation to pledge for unity amongst its citizens? 
By eliminating the differences among  Muslims, it will complete its mission of establishing an Islamic Commonwealth. 
This is the Demon which has tormented Palestine for half a century. 
This Demon has many mouths. 
Many times this Demon attracts the attention and pressure of the World by deserving bad names from his own or from any other mouth. 
Meanwhile the other mouths of this Demon are eating human beings in Iraq, Afghanistan,Iran, and in Pakistan. 
And this Demon is more annoyed with Islam than with any other, because it knows that whenever it is evicted,it will have been only by Islam, Muslims, the complete faith of Muslims, and by practical Islam. History shows that Islam has taken many people like Abu- Jehal on the right path. 
Israel has been bombarding Gaza with air attacks and missiles since the 27th of December. 
Due to these attacks more than 300 Palestinian civilians are dead. 
Since the air attacks, Israeli tanks and other land-invading military vehicles have reached the border of Gaza. 
The United Nations Security Council in emergency meetings have declared the conflict wrong, and counseled Israelis and Palestinians to stop the hostilities. 
Hence Israeli officials have said that they would continue this inspection until they are confident Israel is not targeted by rocket attacks 
In your opinion is it right for Israel to say this inspection is to protect Israel? 
In this situation is the world organization playing its role? 
Is this situations due to the uprisings in Israel? 
Is America, after having the new President Barack Obama will there be any good in conditions in west?

The dark and tough night is very hard suffer. 
Problem can not be solved just by prayers. 
Such reviews are anxiously telecasted by BBC. 
After all, the image and prestige of neutralism has to be kept. 
Though BBC news are often true but the real thing is the delivery. 
What to highlight and which news is given less importance. 
etc. etc. 
Zaheer Chughtai 
Now In this regard our Pakistani print and electronic media, specially few Urdu newspapers and columnists etc., are not behind in the trade who in the coverage or writing of increasing terrorism exaggerate to hell. 
One face of the United Nation appears to care about human rights and peace; the other face allows Muslims to be wronged and tortured to their limits while condemning Hamas attacks.  How long will they continue to have this two-faced policy? 
Why are the Muslims tortured so much?  If the American people would stop favouring Jews, then they would live worse lives, as God said.  So, Americans, stop favoring the Jews and allow them to see their fate. 
All these world renowned leaders and people who murder innocents in the name of peace should realize that peace in the world can only be achieved by justice, and not through injustice or wiping out entire races. 
If killing a particular race off completely is the answer, then Hitler's plan would not have seen any Jews survive, and definitely not seen them rise again. 
Says a poet. 
Injustice is injustice. If it breeds, it dies. 
Blood is blood. If it bleeds, it dies. 
How can anyone define terrorism? 
Isn't all this terrorism too?  Why does only one side's pain seem painful? 
Aren't other people human too?  So why is only Muslim blood so important?  Wasn't all the innocent people's blood red too? 
So why are there no disapproval messages now? 
I watched the Mumbai attacks investigations like the fire was in my own home. I cannot watch this human suffering. Can't everyone else see this suffering? I wish Muslims all over could come together and think about this. 
One cannot describe the bodies, the wounded and the bloodied innocent faces. 
It is pity on the position of Muslims on one side if people are killed in India. No evidence tells Pakistan to investigate or else we would do it 
And the another side, Israel wants to eliminate Muslims and the world is being quiet about this, which is unacceptable. 
God has light, not darkness. And when this darkness ends ... 
The threat to Israeli sovereignty is a joke as long as it has America's backing. 
As far as elections are concerned, it is not surprising that the people who are in power do such things to win the heart and mind of people, especially in a state like Israel. And speaking of Barak Obama, history shows that no American president has wavered from the policy and will not do so in future. A tyrant is a tyrant whether he is white or black. 
It appears from the conversation of the forum that everyone is grieved over Benazir's death, but as a politician her mistakes are not forgotten. 
It is debatable that Benazir died for democracy or for power. 
If she sacrificed for democracy, then why did she leave democracy in the dictatorship of Musharraf for 10 years until she got a deal and American clearance? 
Benazir did not return Pakistan when dictatorship affected people needed her she returned Pakistan when she has the assurances of free from cases and of power. 
No one is going to say anything about the way that this historical figure is being falsely accused.

We have progressed enough.

Though the attack in Mumbai disturbed the talks between India and Pakistan, it is said that the talks will still continue between them 
If the talk is about war, then there will be many loss of human lives. 
During the Mumbai city attack, India said that a letter had been sent by Pakistan. Also, when extremists were captured, it was found that the this attack was well engineered by four party

The relations between India and America are now deep rooted and India certainly wishes that if the time comes, America shall betray Pakistan blatantly.    The relationship between India and America are as strong as the roots of a mighty tree.  The people of India pray that America will remain pro-India if Pakistan were ever to start a war. 
This is also the history of America. 
If India attacks, America achieves her goals while India incurs all of the costs. 
Pakistan should make it clear that it will not initiate hostilities.  However, if Pakistan is attackerd, then it will stop at nothing less than the conquest or destruction of India, no matter how much it costs. 
This is exactly what Islamic history is. 
The Pakistani people and army have made their position very clear. 
The Indians have been too clever by half in pursuing diplomatic advantage from the attacks in Mumbai. As a result, pressure on Pakistan has decreased after the shock has worn off. 
As a side effect of the Indians' unwanted diplomatic efforts, the UN has stated that Pakistan is negotiating and working in good faith, in contrast to Indian complaints. 
There seem to be two opinions that this would not a brutal action. 
The question is, on Monday when thousands of Taliban villages were attacked by Samiuah, where was the Pakistani army? 
Shouldn't the army be accountable for being where they say they will be? 
Thousands are killed every day; the numberous mortar shells and battery is very uneasy for Talibanis. 
I, the ISI, make one appeal to the Taliban, that we will give tutelage heaven Benazir Swat to the peace. 
And the fake operation. 
It won't be long before the UN passes a resolution to allow military intrusion into Pakistan, just like they did against Jamat Aldawa. 
Riaz Ahmed Farooqi 
Extremists and their supporters are continuously providing reasons for the actions taken against them. When such a resolution is submitted, it will be likely that no one will favor us in the UN. 
If the resolution takes too long to approve, it is possible other countries may act on their own, following America's example. 
The Israeli army samiullah adverse, and we achievements and not the information sargarmiya. 
A few minutes later he was not revolutionary. 
Kamaridche Gawera , Nawab Akber Khan Bugti, Dr.Najeebullah and thousands of other protesters' bodies were disrespected by the hands of the enemy.

But they were playing international game here and, is being boorishness and brutality, people scared of the rule. 
There are so that she could be having that if we are not be spokesman ferocious and come to destroy the government . 
Calling Islam an endless religion is a condemnable action. 
The extremists give support to the cruelty of the United States. But this looks like a brutal action against the tribal tradition. 
The tradition of the Mantel Lucrative tribals is not to take brutal action in the name of Islam 
In my opinion our army, people will get the people.

what i only want to ask is when the body was hanging for a whole day what were the army doing were they there to only target civilians all they give their speeches is due to bombing Taliban tanks, there fell a bomb on house resulting death of two children and mother. 
whether they dint know about this situation. 
Or else having fun.

These Taliban's have spoilt the name of Muslims 
Through out the world if Muslims don't tell them Muslims then why would terrorists are found in their territories. 
those who become insensitive and people who don't want to work hard take guns and join these groups 
Islam has not spread from guns and swords. 
be ashamed 
Its need is neither in any religion nor in any customs. 
All media including BBC gives thier views about taliban and tribal areas by different resources 
But nobody knows what the actual situation is. It is we who know about it because we are tribals. 
In short this is a game in which CIA, RAW, MUSAD, and our own ISI is involved.There is nothing like taliban or tribal people, they are the negative elements created by these institutions who are spoiling the name of Islam, Taliban, Religous institutes, Pukhtoon nation and Tribals. 
Because of this act, head of the Muslims petulance of shame . 
I salute the M.Q.M leader Iltaf Hussein, A.N.P and to the division of the P.P.P for raising their voices against this cancer,named Taliban. 
This cancer is creation of Ziaulhaq,who is gone but he has also destroyed the Pakistan. 
But i am hopeful that the present Government will abolish this Cancer. 
After the Mumbai attacks, India said that a few extremist groups are involved in such attacks. 
Pakistan has denied charges and said that India in the investigation will provide all possible help. 
India said they have provided Pakistan a list of 20 extremists who are wanted in India. 
Pakistan said that leader of Jaish e Muhammad, Maulana Masud Azhar, included in this list has not been detained and the Pakistani government has no information about him. 
Previously, president Asif Ali Zardari has denied the allegations that western intelligence agencies and Indian government have provided Pakistan the proof of Mumbai attacks. 
President Zardari said that it is not yet proven that Ajmal Qasab is Pakistani. 
During this Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that relations between India and Pakistan cannot improve while the Pakistani soil is used for terrorism. 
And in recent updates, Indian cricket team has canceled its tour of Pakistan. 
Should these political incidents affect sports? 
How do you see the future developments of the relationship between Pakistan and India? 
Pakistan will not be torn apart by America or India. 
It will be torn apart by Pakistanis themselves. 
What can you expect after so much internal segregation and rivalry? 
However, Jinnah didn't do well for the Muslims of India, and time has already proven that. 
Yasmin: Chicago. 
Madam, if Jinnah's work was carried forward, then the internal cancer of segregation and rivalry would not have spread, and the Muslims in India wouldn't be in the situation they are in now. 
It's our fault that after him, no other leader could stand in his shoes. 
But if we can't appreciate our heroes, then.... 
This sector does have a lot of abilities. 
God knows when they will come to their senses and use the blessing of unity to make some progress. 
Both countries have priests, Shiv sena, RSS etc. that constantly oppose peace. 
And these negative forces do not want the sector to make any progress, hence the countries are kept on their toes. 
Can you imagine the status of this place in the world for Pakistan, India and China, with just a little bit of unity? 
Pakistan is cursed by God for having robbers and thieves as their appointed leaders. 
May God keep our country Pakistan safe, amen. 
Please be open about the facts of the situation, take notice of the warning signs that they will reach the troops. 
Besides, you have misstated the situation in NWFP, Baluchistan and Sindh, and Karachi. 
The winner in her country is a spokesperson, and her ambition is to unite the nations. 
Or, we take mercy on them. 
I think a final war is the only option. 
That's it, enough is enough. 
This situation is """"now or never"""". 
These false acts of cooperation will not solve the problem. 
Nor will small terrorist attacks in each others' countries. 
Afterall, even Europe found peace after the last world war. 
And if there had not been a great war, then they would still be fighting back and forth like Pakistan and India. 
Almost all our political parties are agreed upon the fact that terrorism and sectarianism should be rooted out of the country. 
But our military leadership does not seem to be sincere in this regard. On one hand, they assure America and Europe that they are with them in this war against terror and on the other hand, are covertly aiding the Taliban. 
We should now ponder, set our direction and choose only one path. Thanks 
There is no doubt that the majority of the Movement Leagues are from the Tayaba Group, who joined the Leagues after the inception of Pakistan. 
However, afterwards these League obstructed aid campaigns, and now yielding to India's insistence, United Nations have declared them as the enemy and even the Government of Pakistan is cracking down on them. 
In my opinion, if these Jihadi groups quit their religious fanaticism and try help the people instead, it would be in the best interest of  all. 
The terrorist organizations operating in Pakistan are employing professional criminals in the name of Jihad.  Their mentors  and the mullahs are the same people who called Pakistan, Paleedistan and what not from time to time. 
They are not letting any stone unturned in the way to destruction of Pakistan. 
They do not deserve to be called humans;  let alone muslims. 
Without eliminating these miscreants out of Pakistan, the national security will remain to be at risk. 
Is there still room to consider whether these scoundrels should be banned? 
There is no place in this world for extremist mullahs whose only purpose is to kill. 
Hearts are breaking into pieces over this news. 
What kind of world is this where one cannot survive as an important part of Allah's religion Islam. 
Non Muslims can kill Muslims, but if a Muslim even tries to take revenge, along with the whole non Muslim world, our hypocrite leaders  treat those with true and sincere religion just like they are treating our great leader Hafiz Saeed now a days. 
As a penalty of Mumbai attacks India. 
Pakistani relations are affected, and the recent improvement in relations between the two countries are stopped. 
India continually blames active armed and unarmed groups in Pakistan 
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the actions against these groups. 
Whereas Indian Security agencies have directly blamed Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks, . . . 
Jamat Adawa has also been nominated. 
It is not the first time that because of a terrorist attack, the relationship between these two countries is worsened. 
In December 2000, after the attacks on Indian Parliament, both countries were on the brink of war. 
After that, in 2002 Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned and included on the terrorist list. 
Now Jamat Adawa, to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of Lashka-e-Taiba, is demanded to be banned. 
What do you think, should this group be banned or not? 
Should Pakistan take decisive action against active extremist groups on her soil? 
Can by banning Jamat Adawa present India, 
Pakistan crisis will vanish and to what extent it is vital to ban armed groups for establishing forever peace between the two countries. 
The UN Security Council on the party Al-qaeda banned, the end of the Security Council, what are the evidence seems so hurry? 
Why does The Security Council Against Muslims endorse such activity? 
To say that the plaintiff has a mercurial attitude is an understatement! 
India's own government has become a failed government! 
The army, intelligence, and other security institutions have failed. The terrorists, who hands may carry 72 hours worth of the Defense Department's information, was heard around the world. India's failure was blamed on the pakistinians.

When this beautiful anarchy began to erupt out of nowhere, the pagans began their violence and totalitarian policies. 
Try your luck!  We salute your passion. 
This doesn't happen during the fall. 
If this irritates India, then India should show the evidence. 
Isn't the river tame, not wild? 
All of us who are accused should be on our best behavior. 
Does this banning of groups apply for people in India who are in extremist and other violent organisations? 
The entire world has terrorists. 
What about in India? 
What is Israel? 
The Islamic world is considered to have fighting factions. 
Pakistan is now in it's last stages. 
Kamran Hassan: Abu Dhabi 
Your words touch the heart, and the situation seems so. 
Now in American publications, the new map of Pakistan is being printed, and all these restrictions are now apparent in the series of events. 
The Americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over Pakistan. 
In this situation, if we do not stand together and show our unity, then remember, if Bangladesh can be made, then anything can happen. 
Terrorist attacks should be condemned to the maximum, whether they are on the Mumbai Hotel or the Marriot Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine. 
Similarly, terrorists should be hunted down irrespective of their nationality and whether they are Pakistani, Indian, American or Israeli. 
Now the question is that every day terrorist attacks take place in Pakistan, hundreds of people die but the Pakistani officials along with the rest of the world stay silent. 
Wasn’t the attack on the Marriot Hotel an act of terrorism? 
Then why? 
Appreciation for Interior Advisor Rehman Malik, Masha Allah he has become very brave! 
According to BBC, on one hand Security Council of UN has banned the Jamat Aldawa. On the other, Mr. Malik says they didn't impose the ban and if it is to be done, it will be after a thorough research. 
According to BBC, Mr. Malik has strongly denied that the arrest of terrorists is taking place because of ""someone's instructions."" 
Much appreciated!

If people have right view of justice and independence, respect government institutions and not help any captain or soldier, then there will definitely be peace in Pakistan, which is not liked by its politicians. 
But Pakistan is always following European and American purposes. 
This goes on without the approval of many of its citizens, 
thus invoking hostile sentiments. 
If the administrators believe in the United States of America, then why not just give up their places and leave honorably? 
Pakistan military is armed and dangerous. 
Security forces raided an alleged camp of banned Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan administered Kashmir. 
Pressure is being increased on Pakistan for taking rapid action against extremist organizations after Mumbai attacks. 
India blames Lashkar-e-Taiba for Mumbai attacks. 
American Foreign Secretary, Condoleezza Rice has asked Pakistan’s leadership to take practical measures for instant and transparent action against those responsible for the Mumbai attacks. 
She says that the extremists responsible for the attacks in Mumbai undoubtedly used Pakistan as a base. 
During this, the Peshawar Government says that unknown armed persons set another convoy of goods for Allied Forces deployed in Afghanistan on fire, destroying more than 50 vehicles. 
It is the second attack on Nato and American supplies in Peshawar in 48 hours. 
Attempts made prior to the raid to disarm the  groups of Laskkr e Taiba from Karachi to the Tribal areas were unsuccessful despite offers of rewards for surrendering weapons and promises of immunity. 
It is revealed that during the reign of General Zia ul Huq because of the invasion of the ex USSR in Afghanistan and its resistance started by the American and Saudi funding resulted in the birth of armed groups of which Pakistan unable to terminated could not get back herself to the era before 1980s. 
The question is, does Pakistan want to do it? 
Is Pakistan capable of doing this? 
What do you think?

I have received just one question from human rights groups. 
They will not reward you if you kill their childeren. 
Saeed , Multan 
And now I do have a question for you:  Does anything in Islamic, Eastern, or Western philosophy permit killing innocent people including Nimazi (faithful Muslims), workers, and the poor as revenge for American attacks? 
If not, then you need to clarify your point of view. 
People in Pakistan were armed because it was feared that Russia would conquer Afghanistan, and Pakistan would be next. 
Now when the current American President clearly stated that he might attack Pakistan during his presidential campaign, then why should we disarm these people? 
If they defeat the Pakistani Army, America or India do not expect to face any public resistance. 
Yes, if any of them areinvolved in sabotage activities, then the Pakistani government has the responsibility to try him and punish him, if necessary. 
But then it is sad that the Government is favoring Lashkar-e- Taiba, proving Indian words true.  This has made Pakistan look bad. 
Najeeb ur rehman seiko, *Lahore* [P@KI$T@N] 
If it is believed that Lashkar-e- Taiba is bad, then also it is not proper to blame Pakistan government. 
One more question is that these terrorists have not received any help from either an Indian or Indian Government. 
Is it that terrorists are born and brought up only in Pakistan and they don't come from India or any other part of the world? 
As far as Lashkr-e-Taiba is concerned, the ongoing terrorism is not linked to it. 
It must be recalled that Hafiz Sayeed was the first 'Militant Leader' who declared activities of Taliban as 'revolt'. 
I am quite sure that Taliban agitation is a vital part of American plans. Every person or organization who challenges Taliban in any aspect, must be eliminated. 
Despite the cooperation of the whole nation, Pakistan Government's  action against Lashkar-e-Taiba at the behest of pressure from India, indicates the nervousness and ficklness of Zardari and Co. 
To terminate the expedition started by the funding of America and Saudi Arabia, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society. 
Also question why American and Saudis sell dangerous arms and so called Jihadi but in fact the virus of loathsome literature and culture, due to which human butcher houses established in our country. 
After the threat of an attack from the Indian side, the Pakistan Army announced that they would pull their troops from the Afghan Border and would commit them towards India.  The Taliban declaredthat they would take care of the Afghan Border.  This staggered the Americans badly, and thus they put all their weight behind Pakistan against an Indian attack. 
This exposed the weakness of the American Army in the region. 
Although India neither made any threat of an attack nor dared to do so. 
In addition, attacks of Taliban on the American supply lines proved to be the final nail in the coffin. 
Thus, it was proved that without the help of Pakistan's Government and Army, America would achieve nothing.

You will certainly think of the suggestion as absurd, but don’t you think the cause of the conflict is bizarre? 
The cause of clash is language? 
Zaheer Chughtai 
Sir, during my childhood, I really gave this suggestion on numerous occasions to my friends of all ethnic and religious groups; every time people laughed at it. 
At that time, these ethnic and religious sentiments of hatred were not so strong, they were merely boiling inside. 
You can't understand what and why it is happening? 
Are these the indicators of Dooms Day? 
Why are innocents dieing? 
Everyone knows the causes of those who want to destroy Pakistan are involved. Those who commit all this have no religion or country. 
Either Karachi or Mumbai it is an inside job. 
Every blossoming government starts to  change the names of places in the country. For example, airport, roads, and buildings are all named Benazir. 
Is this the meaning of Benazir which is happening in Karachi and to the peoples of Pakistan? 
In accordance with the Mumbai attack,  it has been said that the the task in Karachi has failed; and those who performed these tasks should resign. 
The Indians in the Karachi should be aware that the laborers are speaking improperly. 
The National parties-- political, religious, and linguistic-- reacted in a diplomatic manner for India against the bomb attack. 
MQM and ANP are responsible for the horrible situation in Karachi, and the administration is not neutral on the issue. 
Administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately 
, police and rangers don't take action because of pressure put on them by political parties. 
The desire to unite is only expressed in speeches.  Political parties should have to abandon their personal interests and work solely for common good of the people. 
Till the time the administration is under political pressure, such incidents will increase. Allah bless Pakistan. 
In my openion,they are the biggest terrorrists. 
And there must be some foreign hands behind it, but do not know who plays the mischief. 
But if these circumstances prevailed in any city of N.W.F.P., then the  Govt. would have gone all out against it using its resources. But, the govt. seems to be helpless as this is not happening  in N.W.F.P. 
Govt. should press the army into service, to save this big and important city of the country from terrorism. 
Otherwise, Pakistan will have to face an grave financial crisis. 
BBC Urdu is under pressure, as the tax situation in Pakistan is very bad. 
BBC Urdu knows all the truth. 
One problem is, the Urdu speakers learn Pastu or Pastu speakers learn Urdu; it is better if both learn English. 
Obviously you would imagine this would be tough; but would you ever think this would become any simpler? 
Is language a barrier to communication? 
Another merciless incident has occurred in Karachi causing widespread terror among locals. 
The media has only reported 50 percent of last four incidents that occurred there. 
I have been without sleep the past three nights- I'm still afraid. 
The intent was to kill the cobblers and dried fruit sellers who tried to empty the hotels.

Ijaz Awan 
Before you gather a crowd of people giving suggestions overnight,I have to tell you that we can find true evidence of real misbehaviour on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalkings and posters. 
We have been seeing both kinds of misbehaviour. 
By the way, vandals did not tolerate the newly created Pakistan and its founder. But they have never experienced any reaction. 
In return, creating problems for the same country, Pakistan. 
Only the Muslim League (N) was left; she also handed over the draft of the 18th amendment to the Peoples Party. 
Before this MQM and the Muslim League (Q) has already submitted the draft of the 18th amendment in the Assembly and the Senate. 
Now, it appears that the 18th amendment was a political move and none of the party is sincere in its approval. 
This is why nobody has raised his voice in favor of this amendment in the Senate or the Assembly and neither forced the House to approve the amendment. 
It seems that by submitting the draft of the 18th amendment these parties have beaten around the bushes, meaning they can claim that they had submitted the amendment but the ruling party's speaker did not proceed. 
MQM an ally of government, Muslim League (N) secret friend and Muslim League (Q) has approved the 17th amendment, then how is it possible that they are sincere in removing 17th amendment. 
It is like painting red to be counted amongst martyred. 
Peoples Party is not what so ever in a hurry to remove 17th amendment. 
Nobody can think of cutting his own hands. 
As long Zardari is President 17th amendment will be there. 
It was majority's opinion in our one survey and a fact too. 
If 17th amendment ought to be removed then Zardari won't become president. 
Now he is more powerful then President Perez as along with the President he is the Chairman of Peoples Party. 
Till he is president 17th amendment is there. 
For removing 17th amendment political parties has to depart President Zardari from President house first. 
Neither MQM wants it nor the other parties. 
Most elders of our family belonged to labor class. 
And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor. 
To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor. 
Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study. 
From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology. 
But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor. 
We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics. 
It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God 
This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons. 
We were not even thirty minutes into our working that our younger son said “Dad, it feels like I am not born for this job."" 
We said that if that is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor. 
Our younger son started saying, ""I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work."" 
The three of us somehow managed to finish the job and get back home. 
It means that when a man decides the destination, no matter what the motives were behind this, no one can stop him from getting it. 
But if you don’t even know what you have to do, then God be with you. 
It is said that one should not accuse the dead, but sometimes one cannot help it, as we see only evils in her on the first anniversary of Benazir. 
On one side, Benazir crushed independence movement of Sikhs by handing over the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India, and on the other hand provided India an opportunity to fully concentrate in Kashmir after crushing the movement in Punjab. 
The greed of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif for government pushed the country back many years. 
During her exile, Benazir continued to give negative statements on Kashmir and the atomic program. 
Benazir made a deal with Pervez Musharraf, betraying the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif. 
During her reign, Benazir provided her husband the opportunity to make money. Because of this he became known  as Mr. 10 percent. 
Benazir brother was killed during her reign whose assassins are still safe. 
Despite being a  woman herself, Benazir avoided adressing issues of women's rights. 
Just as Benazir politicized her father's death, her widower husband politicized hers. 
Benazir reigned twice, but not only did she fail to punish those responsible for the politically motivated murder of her father, she did not even manage to file a case against them. 
It has been thirty seven years since the separation of East Pakistan.  Still look at the height of insensitivity of our people and rulers. No one has mourned or grieved over the mistakes made that day. 
We should look upon the 16th of December as a black day and should take every step possible so that this type of accident does not happen again. 
On that day, we sent messages of peace to the people of Bangladesh and tried to bring them closer to us. 
Rulers open the file of Mehmood-ul-Rehman Commission in order to study the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan. 
They are making strategies to bring back the Beharis (ethnic class) stranded in Bangladesh and send them gifts to encourage them. 
But we have become so indifferent that when someone dies in our own neighborhood we don't know about it. 
We are not even concerned about our brothers because we have become too self-centered. 
Even after big tragedies we return to our routine life the next day. 
Perhaps, like East and West Germany were united, in the same way, East and West Pakistan will also be united once more. 
We can still be united if we are prepared to make sacrifices for each other and come out of the crust of selfishness. 
But this wish does not seem to be fulfilled in the near future 
Today when it was told in the news that Governor of American State Illinois has been arrested for charges of corruption 
and to remove him from governorship provincial Congress is preparing for his rapid accountability, our American friend who has a keen interest in Pakistani affairs said to me 'see this is democracy'. 
No one is beyond the law in America. 
Pakistan's president was cleared of charges before sworn in. 
My sense of humor rouse and I said what's strange if a governor has been arrested in America, in our Pakistan prime minister was arrested overnight and once was hanged and second time was exiled. 
Tell me, has it ever happened in America? 
In Pakistan, the law breaker has  left the presidential residence with an honor guard. Tell me, has this ever happened in America? 
Pakistan Chief Justice has been dismissed. Despite public support, he has not yet been reinstated. Has this ever happened in America? 
In Pakistan, a fake degree holder has become the Health Minister. Has this happened in America? 
By hearing this, Americans laughed like crazy and also accepted his defeat. 
In the picture, despite being ridiculed by Americans from all sides, President Zardari is smiling. 
From his joy it looks like 
He thinks that the Americans approve his government. What he forgets is that these same people were with Musharraf one year before. 
This picture was taken at a family gathering. 
A photo like this -- a president with three American officials -- has never published in the papers before. 
It seems that either American involvement in Pakistan has increased and more than one official is needed to do the job, or they are not relying on their new puppet as they did with their previous one. 
Keeping in mind the stories of President Zardari’s breach of commitments, this photo op could have been arranged. 
If Zardari were a sensible ruler, he would have at least not been grinning during the photo session; he would have had a subservient and embarrassing look on his face. 
If the principle of democracy is applied to the members of this picture, then Present Zardari is in the minority. 
In a democracy the majority rules, and the picture reveals the actual rulers. 
The scenic Swat valley is also called ""the Switzerland of Pakistan."" 
The government’s policy so far is to engage in talks rather than the use of force. 
The use of force achieves nothing other than strengthening the Taliban and increasing public sympathies for them. 
What is needed of the government is to address the root cause of this menace instead of using force. 
With the root causes addressed, Fazalullah and Taliban will die out by themselves. 
The Shariat Bill by the ANP government will help address the problem to a great extent. 
However, the government must address the financial problems in addition to the implementation of Shariat. 
General Musharraf, the rights that his aches that this nation diagonal scientists have activity will be rid of the power, but those who has the intention of changing the interview with CNN 
He also to the amadein 
The expected actions would never occur. 
When the rule of Bush was coming to an end, he became scared and started dealing with thieves. 
General Musharraf, the army had to control, but the present Government not only to what is the. 
The Bajaur and Swat terror was uncontrollable by army. 
Swat the troubled region of North West Frontier province more than a year in time to continue the military action despite the bad situation worse than are . 
The government to a writ in this region only unwise in the National Assembly passed a resolution is left to the extent , the Taliban and other illegal FM radio channel of influence in Swat much is being .

I'm afraid that if the Pakistani military is unable to stop a small group of Taliban from entering the country, then how can they fight with India? 
They are unable to track the non-judicial F.M channel which is running by Taliban,but I would think that is very easy. 
Then they didn't take any action against the Taliban's illegal F.M channel which is spreading poison all over and ruining their country. 
After closing the girls schools now they are closing the boys schools too. 
They order curfew so that Taliban people can move easily or proceed easily. 
Tonight during curfew eight Turks entered Mangora's environ and ENTRENCHED them. 
Now the question is after being under curfew how did the Taliban get in . 
The Army can kill Akber Bagdi at his home but they gave salami to the Taliban. 
For god's sake, can anyone make them understand that helping the helpless people of SWAT and releasing them from the Taliban's army can prove that the Pakistani army is strong enough to take action against any one of his enemy. 
He says, maximum bloodshed has been done in the name of religion. You tell me in the absence of any religion won't bloodshed still occur? 
Punjabi and Pathan, White and black, Mehsud and other tribes, are all these created by religion? 
Not at all, sir. Religion preaches to us that there is no white or black; no Punjabi or Muhajir. If there is no religion then half of the world would have been destroyed by the war between black and white, and remaining half by the war of caste. 
Actually, religion nourishes a person's morality. It also restricts him so that he is not living by his own rules byr rather has to live by God's rules because he is sent by The Creator of Universe. 
As a Muslim I believe that Islam is the true religion, and i use it as a complete code of life. 
After moving to London, I used to call my relatives back home every single morning, although they never called me even once. Then I realized they were inconvenienced by my calls, so I stopped calling them. 
After living in France now for two years, I feel the same way I did when i arrived. 
I don't know why people always expect us to make calls. 
Resolution about Iraq passed in a few hours, sending UN peace force to Darfur is not a problem. 
Immediate condemning Mumbai battacks and restricting suspected groups can be done in few hours.

It has been shown that this area has been Israeli territory for thousands of years. 
Both of the groups should compromise with each other and live in peace, but as their relations are in the hands of Arab and western countries, without their approval there will be no peace. 
Moreover, Iran also wants to fight its proxy war from here. 
If Israel stops for a while, then for some reason after a while it will start again. 
The interests of BBC Homeland are affiliated with America and Israel and this is why it has produced a series of pro-Jewish blogs and is conducting one-sided and blatant 'propaganda' under the banner of 'broadmindedness'. 
BBC is only carrying the 'formality' and its objective is to have sympathies! 
It is requested to Mr. Moderator that he must publish this review so that it may be proved that BBC has an element of realism to some extent. 
Thanks.

Never been so like that.

Yesterday at noon a strange thing happened. 
All of the police were running here and there but was not the least concerned about illegal parking. 
NYPD traffic control was not in the mood for noticing illegally parked vehicles. 
What happened was, an US Air airplane had crash landed in the Hudson River. 
Till now the only information pulled out was, ""the terrorists"" were of the goose breed. 
Yesterday it might be historically cold in New York. 
The temperature does not fall this low. 
My jaw started to ache because of walking outside for half an hour. 
Just imagine what would have happened to those who jumped off the plane into the river. 
It was a great relief that all the people were safe. 
The dark side is that the company's plane crashed in this financial crisis. 
While watching all this, I went to New Jersey by West Side Highway. I Noticed that South Bound is blocked. Anyone else catch a glimpse of it? 
Yes, I was jammed in it on my way back. 
Thanks God! During my hour trip the road was bit clear as I gof off on an exit from 56th street. 
I wasn't able to get off from two of the exits due to all the vehicles blocking the way.

We are not related to the Taliban. Taliban opposes education of women. 
They show their anger by demolishing schools and colleges for women. 
But this is not true. CNN reports show that on Monday the Taliban demolished a school for boys too. 
Taliban has demolished boys' school in Southern Afghanistan. 
Girls Schools according to famous proverb """"Literacy first"""" following it was destructed first, Cant understand why people still believe Taliban as irresponsible and nomadic creatures? 
It is clear from this condition, that it's not proper to quote Taliban against women's literacy. 
But by God's grace they are totally against literacy. 
Allah the great should give this Mujaheddin more power and rule 
May Allah help them to destroy those who rule us. 
Ameen Summa Ameen. 
By God's grace until now, 182 schools have been demolished.

Humanity will be wiped out in the 21st century. 
Today is the age of computers, and computers' influence is growing in every aspect of life. 
Lots of people have many reservations about this growing influence of computers, like in financial issues. 
You can use credit cards, but this gives law enforcement agencies a firmer grip on your private life. 
They can track your credit card records to expose you. 
In the future, less physical currency will be used, and its utility will increase. 
Similarly, you don't have to rob a bank to commit a financial crime when you can break into credit card records. 
Similarly, friendship has become computerized. 
Social networking websites like Orcet, Facebook and MySpace are the most popular. 
However, as people spend more time on these sites, they spend less time around other actual people. 
Similarly, matchmaking websites will provide you with a list of potential dates after you tell them about yourself and your interests. 
Can you spend life without a mate? 
I can't do it, that is why a life partner is called my better half. 
That is because he/she may cover my deficiencies. 
Perhaps I received a lesser share of wisdom. 
From childhood, I thought that anything that adults told me was true. 
In the same way, I was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world. 
I was even ridiculed a lot for this reason. 
But only plausible things seemed true. 
I was always perplexed at the need to tell a lie. 
Even at this age, I suffered because of it. 
So I tried to keep the lies to a minimum. 
I refrained from giving false hopes to others, particularly with Allah’s name. 
And only say, ""God willing"" when I wished the work be done. 
Allah always knows what is in their hearts. 
This is a disturbing problem which appears because the religion is misunderstood. 
According to both our religion and the law in Pakistan, infants should remain with their mothers. 
Their father is responsible for their financial needs and he may be allowed to see them. 
Then when the kids become mature they can decide with whom they want to live. 
You have mentioned correctly that the real problem is those relatives who poison their minds. 
Jagirdar thinking on all of our deeds exercises. 
Thinking the same thing here working in the property of the father, a new parts and will be opposed the same otherwise his father, the process is commendable and counterfeiting. 
Our relationship with the spasm establishments was created the Social abuses. 
Applying the concept of marriage to widows is rare. 
The same non-essential beliefs and traditions stem from the family's anxiety. 
Why can't our society accept the remarriage of a widowed 50-year old? 
A Pakistani man who had always been close to his wife, was widowed over 10 years ago.  This man remarried a woman, a widower herself, much to the dismay and disappointment of his relatives. 
In my opinion they have the right? What's your opinion? 
In my opinion, no one can take the place of my mother. Anyone else agree? 
In my opinion the children of this person should think that after having married all the kids, is there anything wrong in his marrying a widow? 
This way the widow gets a caretaker and uncle also gets someone who will take care of his home. 
Because his children would certainly be busy in their worldly affairs and would not be having time for him. 
The reason behind this is ignorence. 
In the future, what if their wives refused to work for the old man? 
This is the outcome of the social pressure. 
Childeren feel ashamed on the second marriage of their father when people make jokes of such family on this action. 
Where as they must face the circumstances and say that what their father did, it was just according to Islam. 
This is a curse in our society that has been around for the past 40 to 50 years. 
Even a wife is agreed on the unethical activities of her husband but does not allow her for second marriage. 
If she had the power, she would not allow him to do this even after her death. 
Along with husband spoils her afterlife too and causes an increase in corruption in society. 
The customs of the US and Islamabad are not really the same as the tourists say. 
Such as the the culture of girls, education, marriages, etc. 
The question is that, the widow of the house have a abdominal contraction again. 
In IndopPak we embraced Islam centuries ago but can't get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then Islam. 
Second marriage of man as ridiculous, divorce as stigma, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as disgrace and man's marriage with an elder woman as the result of her cunningness is all because of such thinking. 
Moreover, to copy western nations, we declare veil and worship backward. 
It was easy to embrace Islam, but to get rid of such thinking is very difficult. 
Allah bless us all with the courage for our task. 
Amen. 
Writing Urdu was never that difficult. 
Centuries passed in writing this little. 
Consider it enough. 
Allah Hafiz. 
In his book ""Main hoon Taymoor,"" Amir Taymoori writes, ""I realized in my life a secret that if the military commander of the military is in first row then that military would never loose."" 
However, our situations here is different. 
Their belief was that people are present only to die for us, and that dying thusly is pious. 
However, if people die in this manner, then they have been murdered. 
Good. 
Tonight after Ishan's namaz, I was heading toward the shop when a person caught my attention. 
I thought that he had lost his way or wanted to ask me something; when I stopped, I saw that his whole family was with him. 
He narrated his topic i fluently understand Arabic i told no problem tell me your problem? 
He told me, ""I came from Riyadh, and I was pick-pocketed here. Could you kindly help me out?" 
I got very angry and said him a lot and thretened him of cops so he left the place immediately 
Si this has been the situation of Muslims now for begging too we use vehicles and come with our families and through out the day cheat three thousand from people

The famous singer, Adnan Sami's wife, reported to the police that her husband was torturing her. 
The police advised her to press charges and take the claim to court. 
The wife of Adnan Sami, Saba Galadari has pressed charges of repeated torture and inhuman conduct against her husband, Adnan Sami. 
and behaves inhumanly, 
She is fed up with his abuse and therefore decided to file a case against him. 
Since this case is not under the jurisdiction of the police, they asked her to consult the court. 
Do you believe this claim made by Adnan Sami's wife is true? 
Or may this be another attempt by India to defame Adnan Sami? 
Let us know what you think about this matter. 
Adam Sanghar, Meher 
As far as the allegations are concerned, anyone can make them against any other person. 
There is nothing superior to honor. 
Whatever the current state of relations between Adnan Sami and his wife, Adnan Sami left his respectable life and went to India to earn a fortune. The same fame has now importuned him. 
It is the consequence of his wrongdoings. 
Washington 
American high officials have stated that President Obama will take a stern attitude towards the Afghan President Hamid Karzai. 
The new American strategy towards Afghanistan will focus on war instead of development. 
The officials said that Hamid Karzai is viewed as an obstacle in achieving American interests in Afghanistan because of government corruption, a rise in drug trafficking, and the Taliban's increasing strength. 
The American officials also said that those people in the current administration who are pressuring Hamid Karzai to do more include Vice President Joe Biden and American Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrook. 
They stated that the policy change came after President Bush left office. The former president used to have video conferences with Hamid Karzai, and emphasized America's role in the rebuilding of Afghanistan and its civil institutions. 
The Obama administration will work with provincial political leaders instead of the central government. 
They said that they will ask Hamid Karzai to intensify the campaign against corruption. 
Hamid Karzai is facing new elections this year and it is not yet clear whether President Obama and his administration are going to back him up in the presidential race. 
Does this statement reflect a shift in American policy toward Afghanistan? 
Is Hamid Karzai’s era coming to an end?

The Sri Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan to participate in a one-day international series. 
The visit of a foreign team to Pakistan, in spite of Pakistani-Indian tension, is a good sign. 
On reaching Karachi Airport, the Sri Lankan team was given a warm welcome. 
Two matches will be held between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Karachi, while the third one will be played in Lahore. 
Both teams are highly regarded for their batting, bowling and fielding. 
If Sri Lanka values its spinners, Pakistan relies on its fast bowlers. 
Sri Lanka’s captain Mahela Jayawardene says that no one player but rather the Pakistan cricket team as a whole is to be a force to be reckoned with. 
Muralidharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, while Pakistan’s captain says that this competition will be tough.

All this is done by these people. Kashmir has been fighting for its freedom for past 60 years. 
those who have not asked about it have now themselves in deep violence. talks of comprise has been started 
Those who first killed Muslims openly are now heading for cover. 
Pakistan should be more aware of their double policies. 
Asad Khan: London 
India is cultivating situations such that the Kashmir situation is overlooked. 
Pakistan, however, has always shown India's true face to the world. 
Even the British government now understands this, which is why India is actively ruining Pakistan's reputation with terrorism accusations -- to distract the world from the Kashmir situation. 
And _____  hesitates to talk with Pakistan about this.    (there is no subject in this sentence). 
Britain's Secretary of State David Miliband said that resolving the Kashmir issue will curtail extremism so that the Pakistani government will be able to efficiently tackle the dangers faced at the border. 
It should be noted that newly elected American President Barack Obama has recently expressed similar thoughts on the Kashmir issue. 
Miliband has written as well as stated to media in Mumbai that the idea of a ""war against terrorism"" is wrong; killing people in response to threats was the policy of former American President George Bush. 
Milliband also said that Pakistan should not have any soft quarter for extremist groups. 
Is India purposefully creating uncertainity in the region to avoid the resolution of Kashmir issue by world stakeholders? 
Are the Mumbai attacks the part of this plan? 
Does India want to avoid the comprehensive talks by on the basis of terrorism?

Faheem Siddique 
Raas Al Khaima, It is due to America that wrong statements are being given , America is out of its mind but now India is also doing the same, India should try attacking , then it will become crystal clear that who stands where. 
Israel is attacking Hammas but nobody has that much integrity to stop them. India also want to follow Israel's foot steps 
Prime Minister Syed YOusaf Raza Gillini said that the newly elected vice president Joe Biden had played an important role in steping down of previous president musharraf as army cheif and restoring crippled democracy, thats why the government of pakistan has awarded him with Sitare-e-Imtiaz (honour medal)

All decisions will be taken in the parliment

U.S. President George W. Bush in his farewell press conference advised the newly elected President Barak Obama by saying that he has done many mistakes in his presidency and if Barak Obama finds something right,just do it. 
As the President, I have taken steps according to the situation and the Constitution and under the law, given priority to the American interests on my popularity. 
He said that the US enemy is still planning to attack America, and the biggest challenge for Barak Obama would be to stop the attacks. 
He said that not to get the Mass destruction weapons, was my largest disappointment and the biggest mistake was to admit the completion of the Iraq mission. 
While addressing the American President in the White House in his last press conference, he said it is my last press conference I thank to journalists and other friends who attended this Conference .

Will Dick Cheney's wishes come true, and will Osama be arrested?

Zubair Khan, Karachi 
It is extremely sad that Israelis are openly killing Palestinians. In India, Kashmir is in a similar situation, but the Peace Council doesn't turn a ear to it. 
All groups in Kashmir and Palestine should keep the war for freedom going. They should unitedly fight all forces that oppose them. God willing, a day will come when their martyrdom will bear fruit. 
Israel continues air attacks on Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been killed. 
A well known leader of the Hamas Nazaar Rayyan family has been killed. 
The Security Council session ended without a decision. 
America has opposed the censure resolution against Israel submitted by Lebia and other Arab countries in the session. 
Israeli airplanes bombardment has continued since it's many days spent in the Palestinian civil population. 
The whole world reacted on Mumbai attacks, but no countries including America and England can see the bloodshed caused by Israeli attacks. 
Why are the major countries of the Muslim world silent? 
What do you wish to say regarding this double standard of the world. 
Saeed, New York 
I think the actual point  is that the majority of our nation is illetrate. They do not know where their money is going. The government is interested in applying taxes and fulfilling their duties. The shortage of electricity and gas will remain same. 
Those whom are elected by the public are very well known. 
The crisis of electricity and gas has worsened in the whole country of Pakistan. 
On the other hand, gas prices have been raised by the average of eight percent. While in a few cities the unavailability of petrol caused extreme alarm for people. 
Intense reactions, riots, and torturous demonstration have continued in the industrial and business circles of Pakistan. This is due to the crisis in the shortage of electricity and gas. 
Industrialists have issued and ultimatum by threatening a shutdown. 
In Karachi, people are worried about the 8 to 10 hour load shedding. 
The industrial sector is almost paralyzed. 
Government institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other. 
Increasing the prices of electricity and gas is not a joke with people. 
Why are the solutions of the problems not considered? 
Is government not seeing the full stop on national development? 
What immediate steps would you recommend for managing this crisis? 
Let us know your opinion. 
Imran Khokar from Madīnah Munawwarah: “I would like to say that rulers are a reflection of society’s morality. 
I am surprised that a government that claims to be people-friendly is hostile towards them. 
Non-availability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a menace. 
The government does not have any control over institutions. 
The law and order situation is worsening day by day. May Allah have mercy on the country.

Salman Karachi 
People who are proud to go to India 
And make their films and own Videos should now open their eyes and see that how Indians respect you 
I remember an interview with Adnan Sami in which he said, ""I am not a Pakistani, my nationality is British."" 
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan in first chance because he is not to be respected there as well 
Fareed Ahmed

Indians got a change in their attitude after Mumbai attacks. 
Jugjeet Singh started hating Pakistan and Pakistanis at their reaction. 
The point to ponder is that Adnan Sami has sung songs with Aasha Bhonsle.So he is not a bad voiced singer.Adnan Sami should stay in India,he has no need to come here. 
Muhammad Shah AAlam 
Regarding Jagjit Singh I would tell that he changes colors like a chameleon . 
The one who is taking care of situation gives opinion about it.The people of Pakistan open up your eyes and see that you are greatly respected in India.Understand their feelings. 
After the Mumbai attack their feeling of hate has increased.Now they are talking against the famous singer Adnan Sami. 
According to foreign news agency the situation has become funny when President Bush along with Prime Minister Noor Almalki in press conference at his office in Baghdad when an Iraqi journalist said to President Bush, ""Dog, this is farewell kiss"". 
After this journalist removed his shoe and threw it at Bush, President bush expertly moved his head out of the way and saved himself. 
Second shoe hit the American flag. 
Security officials dragged him out of there. 
On this occasion President Bush said I don't know why he did this, shoe was of size 10, I was not bothered. 
Do you think that this action by the journalist depicts the anger of Iraqi people against President Bush. 
What will you say about this?

Its true that they were killed but we feel sorry that they killed many innocent people in Karachi,at which they feel proud that Naseer Ullah Baber did a good job 
But later,changed at all. 
But it's also true that she ignored the senior members of her party and nominated her own son as the representative of the People's Party. What sort of democracy is it? 
Jimmy Noor,Karachi,This news has proved Quran's statement that a non Muslim will actually help an other non Muslim. 
But if the iron axe has no handle,it can't cut anything. 
Our leaders are secretive, and that's why our country is suffering. 
May Allah Almighty show the right path to our leaders.

Our rulers should understand that they are fighting their own people who are willing to bear the hardships for thier love for Pakistan. 
If a war occurs, then they will fight for Pakistan. 
You cannot simply condemn politics in this case.  I think between these two things, a war is very likely.
