This directory contains the systems that were submitted to the NIST 2009 Urdu-English translation task.  NIST anonymized the systems and removed a few of the documents to avoid people being able to easily use the Bleu scores to tell which system is which.

The Batch file is the results of the Urdu translation HIT (with images shown instead of text).  Each of the source sentences in the NIST-09 test set was translated 3 times.

------
The ref-set v ref-set-full files differ because the ref-set is a subsampled portion of the output of all the systems.  NIST subsampled to keep the systems a little more anonymous.

The calibration-set-size directory contains curves for different sizes of calibration set sizes (10% -- 100% at 10% intervals, because it is easy to break things down in that way given that we're having Turkers translate 10 sentences at a time) for 1--4 references.
