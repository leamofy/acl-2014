So far are being dialogues with power, according to the government strategy.	Till now According to the government's strategy of force with dialogues are being taken.

During the operations in Swat carried out by security forces, it is claimed that gunship helicopters and bombings of arsenals killed many extremists, but in spite of these killings, not only has the Taliban grown stronger - according to one estimate, their control has been established in 80 percent of Swat.	It is necessary that the place of power should end the reasons of the government.	Power, it is imperative that the instead of the government to remove the reasons of 	It is necessary that the power of the Instead of the government reasons.
In conclusion, the government is not ready to accept its failure, and the Taliban is stronger.	By the end of the reasons, Fazal God and the Taliban itself will finish by themselves.	Reasons grace and the end of the Taliban to himself will be removed. 	Reasons for the end of the grace of God, and will be the end of the Taliban.
The ones who got stuck in the middle were the poor citizens.	ANP will create a cause of Swat solution to the extent of the bill on behalf of the government.

Until now, according to government strategy, negotiations are being held along with the use of power.	Elimination of Bush, they began to think of the end of their power and thieves in given.	As soon as Bush began The End of era of power, they themselves began the end of thought and in deal to the thieves. 	As soon as the end of the Bush era, they themselves at the end of the power and thieves in the deal.
But the use of force is having no benefit other than to increase the strength of the Taliban and create sympathy for them among the people.

By eliminating the reasons, Fazlullah and the Taliban will fall apart on their own.	More than a year in the troubled Swat region of the North West Frontier Province issued a military operation, despite the corruption are worse.	Frontier province more than a year in the troubled area Swat time with worse than ugly situation, despite the continued military action are. 	Despite being a military operation for more than two years in the troubled area of the North West Frontier Province Swat things are going from bad to worse.
The Sharia Bill proposed by the ANP government will go a long way to help solve the problems of Swat.	On one hand, the writ of the government in this area only Condemnatory resolution in the national assembly has been reduced to the extent, and on the other hand, the influence of Taliban illegal FM radio channel is more used in Swat.	One hand the government only approved resolutions in the National Assembly Resolution writ in the area has been reduced to a great extent to, and on the other hand, Taliban Influence OF Illegal RADIO FM Channel IN SWAT IS MUCH MORE. 	On the one hand, the writ of the government in this area only condemnatory in the National Assembly passed a resolution to the extent, and on the other hand, Taliban illegal radio channel, THE Influence of the Swat IS MUCH MORE.
But along with enforcing Sharia, the government will also need to focus on the economic problems.
