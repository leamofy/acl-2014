    <seg id="3">this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.</seg>

    <seg id="6">the reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">he further added that this was the reason that in 1998 only in a span of two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments as a reply to Indian nuclear experiments.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that in May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with a lot of care and Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reed was asked this question that China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan so he said in his answer that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that its evidence is also present that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan has used the Chinese model. Later the documents received from Libya also confirm this.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Another question that is it common to do nuclear experiments mutually. Then he said that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that we also predict that Israel also has access to the results of this experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reeds was also asked if China is continuing nuclear proliferation?</seg>
    <seg id="15">On this Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and the design to a nuclear facility of Iran in its city Asfahan.</seg>

On the other side, Germany has also sent its special ambassador to Middle East. European Union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Its evidence is the reaction of Israel who does not pay an importance to the conciliation efforts of the EU.</seg>

    <seg id="7">According to the American Medical Association, not getting enough exercise can lead to numerous health issues.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Patricia Paylekka of the Mew Clinic of Minnesota reports that with increase in age, exercise is a major factor in determining proper body functioning.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr Patricia teaches Medicine in Mew Clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She has done extensive research on older age and the ability to exercise with increasing age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">A team of doctors used High Frequency rays to determine the functioning of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="12">In which, the ability of the heart to pump blood, and it's ability to shrink and relax was researched.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Experts have concentrated mainly on the left side of the heart which is mainly responsible for the pumping of blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They discovered that with increase in age, the problems in the rate of heart relaxation also increase.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says that with increase in age, the problems in the heart relaxation rates increases and thus effects the ability to exercise with growing age.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Carwin Cain was also part of this research.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that it's surprising to see the permanent effects of improper exercise on the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="18">In some instances, blood pressure is a factor in heart anomalies and heart diseases.</seg>
    <seg id="19">If doctors and patients can work together when it comes to heart diseases, then they can enjoy the benefits of exercise even with older age.</seg>

     <seg id="1">Most elders of our family belonged to labor class.</seg>
     <seg id="2">And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="3">To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.</seg>
     <seg id="5">From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.</seg>
     <seg id="6">But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.</seg>
     <seg id="7">We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.</seg>
     <seg id="8">It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God</seg>
     <seg id="9">This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.</seg>
     <seg id="10">It was not even 30 minutes for us working that our younger son said “Dad it feels like I am not born for this job.</seg>
     <seg id="11">We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="12">Son started saying that I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work .</seg>
     <seg id="13">Three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home.</seg>
     <seg id="14">What it means is that when a man decides the destination no matter what were the motives behind this no one can stop him from getting it.</seg>
     <seg id="15">But if you don’t even know what you have to do then God be with you.</seg>
