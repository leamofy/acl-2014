'first nuclear experiment was done in 1990'
Thomas Reid who has worked in the Lever national laboratory of America as a Weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the Ex director of technical intelligence at Las Elmos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.
this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.
in an interview with US news, Thomas Reid said that in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's rule, China experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Thomas Reid said that based to many reasons, he has a belief that China had experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
the reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.

Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiment.
He further said that in May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with a lot of care and Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.
When Thomas Reed was asked this question that China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan so he said in his answer that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.
He said that its evidence is also present that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan has used the Chinese model. Later the documents received from Libya also confirm this.
Another question that is it common to do nuclear experiments mutually. Then he said that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.
He said that we also predict that Israel also has access to the results of this experiment.

Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.

The role of European Union for the peace in Middle East
Officially European Union plays a decisive role in the mediatory efforts taken for stopping the war in Middle East.
According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of Sarkozy are helping hands in this process.
European Union spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said every single step which may help in delivering the conjoint message of European Union to fighting parties is appreciable.
Officially everything seems fine.
But in fact European Union is portraying a picture of internal tension, stress and strain.
The role of Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak
plus internal affairs has made her helpless.
On the other hand the course of action of French President Sarkozy depicts that France is still the President of European Union.
Although 6 months Presidency tenure of France is over.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role which he is capable of, but he isn't the authority.
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner is facing the funniest side.
He is in the delegation which is led by Schwarzenberg the Foreign Minister of Czech Republic.
In addition to that, the two foreign ministers are giving different statements on the war in Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend herself, while according to Kouchner war is not the defense. Germany has also sent a special ambassador to Middle East. As long as European Union does not show unanimous stand, she can not be successful on diplomatic front.
The prove is the no lift conduct of Israel to mediatory efforts of European Union.
This is the best time for European Union to prove herself, as America has failed in Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.

9 percent has reduced to .21
4 percent.

Other than Bavaria, Hemberg is also working on same pattern.
Senator Christoph Ahlhaus of Interior ministry from CDU said:"" When the scientific research is conducted one can not draw results of his own rather they depend on the data which is calculated after research.

Results indicate that here foreigners
crime rate is less then the crimes committed in the whole province.

Tea: Effective cure of Chest Cancer
In a new research it is being told that drinking 3 cups of tea everyday
reduces the danger of chest cancer in women under 50 years of age by 1/3rd.
The research happening in the Moffitt Cancer Center in the American State of Florida, has showed that chances of getting tumor of chest cancer in those women under 50 years of age
is reduced by 37%, who drink at least three cups of tea everyday.
It is also told in the research that it does not help older women even if they drink three or more cups of tea daily.
Specialists think that this is because of the presence of such components in tea that are more effective against such types of cancer tumors, which usually targets women under 50 years of age.
in the Moft Cancer Center situated in Tampa city of the State of Florida, a research was carried out on 5 thousand women who had taken the treatment for breast cancer.

the experts compared their medical record and life pattern with that of women who were safe from breast cancer.
the experts also found out that on a particular type of cancer, Lobular, tea had shown a great effect and it reduced by 66 percent.
almost every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type of it.
this type of cancer is more dangerous because it deep inside and is usually diagnosed when it has already spread to a great extent.
Experts say that by taking at least three cups a day regularly, the danger of breast cancer can be reduced in young women.
they say that making tea a regular drink in daily life can cause great resistance in the body against breast cancer.
in Britain, every year, almost 40 thousand women are diagnosed to have breast cancer.

why reduce exercise with the age?
new research
exercise at any age is good for health.
it energizes your heart, reduces the cholesterol level, helps in keeping the weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer or dementia.
unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.
experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.
Dr. Pattricia P. Leka of Maya clinic Minnesota says that increase in age is a big reason for being handicapped from exercise and less physical activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo clinic.
She headed a research regarding heart diseases and man's ability to do exercise in older age.
Team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart.
In which heart's activity of pumping blood and its contraction and relaxation was studied.
Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.
They came to know that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.
Dr. Patricia says with increase in age, problems occur in the activity of relaxation of heart and with increase in age, this effects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research
He says that we were surprised to see that it has an effect  and it confirmed that bad exercising ability is very much related to the heart relaxing activity.
some times blood pressure can cause disorders in heart's functions and heart diseases.
if the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard, then they can take advantage of the benefits of exercise even with the age.
a detailed report in this matter is published in a magazine of American Medical Association.

May God answer the world's prayers and may Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, but we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan , effected by this change, are in our favor.
That what will Mr. Barrack Obama give to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams.
Obama's (whose name has Hussein also), oath as a President of America on one hand is historical while on the other hand is a hard test too
not only for him but for all those people who has supported him heartily.
This will also be a test for white people majority as it is not easy for them to accept heartily the presidency of black on them.
Here in Southern Asia specially Muslims who have developed expectation from him must remember that he has been elected as President of America and Obama must remember that President of America is Practically the president of the whole world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have to have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, so this will be a win for people who love him.
What will be its effect on South Asia and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan.

Dear, whether it is Obama or some one else, the decision of the policy of the entire world is done by Jews lobby of  billionaires, influencing, powerful and effective people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts,the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is in front of everyone.
Even for a while, after Pakistan was formed, the managing of Swat was left to the Ruler of Swat, which had it's own army and law.
They surrendered their rule to the government of Pakistan according to a treaty.
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a step mother.
There has been no increase in the number of schools in Swat, since the rule of the Ruler of Swat was finished.
Nor was there any interest in the construction and development over there.
The number of girls receiving education in the present rule is many times less than their number in the previous rule.
Targeting of educational institutes is continued by local Talibans in NWFP Province of Pakistan.
Most schools are destroyed in Swat majority of those are of girls.
Not only this Taliban has announced a ban on girls education.
Thousands of students (boys and girls) are unable to get education.
What do you think Talibans wants to achieve by stopping women education.
Why the government has failed to stop these illegal actions?
In your opinion what government should do.
Question must be this that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
Because Swat people has understand the game that army is there to serve Taliban not to kill them otherwise how five schools can be destroyed in a single night during curfew, how people can be butchered and hanged in the square.
When government writ is unable to implement in Swat in these circumstances how the government will succeed in eliminating these illegal activities.
Now the question is when government has every thing like armed force, latest weapons, latest technology and spy system then why these Taliban can;t be controlled?
The only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught.
The essence is that these Taliban are paving the path for 'International Imperialism' by their bad deeds.
fifteen years before the war was continued in Afghanistan.
ISI used to control the Taliban when there was the opposition from the Northern Alliance, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then, suddenly the situation changed and Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of Dollars from America, so the previous friend became an enemy.
Now the situation has changed but the war is still going on and those supporting them in Pakistan are still Russia, India and Iran.
Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.
For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play Holi with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings
The question is that, is war, armed resistance and terrorism the solution to problems?
If not, then what is the magic recipe that will bring out a solution to the problems?
This is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but rather it puts 'blessings' in them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development, that Nelson Mandela had used in South Africa.
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
From the Kashmiris taking part in the elections, it looks as if they have accepted this view point.
It is the third week of Israeli attacks on Gaza and the number of deaths have gone close to a thousand.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date, a ceasefire was not possible.
According to another report, since the start of attacks, on the 27th of December, 90,000 Palestinians have left their homes and moved towards safer locations.
Here, aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, and said that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victim of grave psychological and emotional difficulties.
What do you say?
What should happen?
how is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Taliban should be given a chance
basit, Peshawar
Please wakeup, if the Taliban start doing the real Jihad, then who will kill the innocent people.
Who will burn down the girls' schools?
who will do kidnapping for ransom or if ransom not paid then blame people of being American agents and hang them on the towers?
these Taliban have brought such damage to Islam that no nation or religion has ever brought.
Pashtoon Rore
Kohat, Pakistan
If the whole Islamic world just threat Israel for launch of attack you will see that in how much pain father of Israel America will be in
and not only talks about real ceasefire rather ceasefire will be accomplished.
But what to do our Muslim leaders lack the courage greatly.
Some one ask Ahmadinejad to take the initiative because your bravery is very popular in BBC Forum.
the responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on Arabs and the Muslim world but its and obligation on the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny.
this unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
Just like in Pakistan and India before 30th June or the end of the fiscal year, the government institutions are looted, the American regime just before its end have given a green signal to Israel to do what ever it wants.
on one hand America says that effort will be made for ceasefire.
On the other hand, the United Nations is accepting petitions and more petitions, but in reality it's nothing. This means only one thing, that even the United Nations is in on the conspiracy against muslims.
All Muslim nations should disregard the United Nations, and unite under their own weight.
We have a lot of examples in front of us. Where America and United Nations are only passing petitions, the Muslims are bearing the brunt of it.
What is the use of these vain efforts if BBC does not want to publish anything?
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically of Muslims, is spilled, the monster of unbiasedness gets onto BBC's back.
which considers itself the standard bearer of truth.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments
from Muslims
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, and the likes of you stay among Muslims, call yourselves Muslims and cause Muslims..
[syja786]
For a long time on BBC forums, sometimes suicide bombing and other times terrorism in India was used to target a certain sect.
The favorite word of these Anti-Islamic discussions was Extremism.
You can get a very good idea, about who an extremist is, from the above discussion in which, writing against Iran was almost considered blasphemy.
When will our muslims understand that Anti Christ can not be fought with swords.
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what shall one do other than crying?
But the basic fault is of this turmoil and massacre which by naming Jihad, we try to blacken the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of Palestinians accepted the existence of Israel then why did Hammas need to fire those rockets on Israel and made suicide attacks?
Attitude of the both the sides is against humanity.
The role of UN and the USA was again seen as favoring towards the injustice of Israel.
May Allah give muslim nation the understanding of becoming  united. Ameen!
and the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism, after all they are doing the real work.
otherwise, is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are.
so in this situation, in common terms it is called DADAGEERI which means do what ever you can.
That it even hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry.
medicines for injured, and coffins for the dead are being supplied by the Arab leaders and asked that
Should the Israeli attacks take place?
this is the actual problem that the leaders of Muslim countries including Saudi crownprince are in a false sleep, neither they have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
they should take immediate measures against Israel.
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Salam to All brothers and sisters!
In my opinion, telling Hamas to quit in the name of peace now, would be an injustice to thousands of widows and orphans.
If the Israelites and their supporters are at a rise, then soon Moses shall be born, as this is the law of nature. America and Israel work as gunpowder amongst suicide bombers in Muslims.
The power drunk elephants do not understand this.
Abu Abdulla: Pakistan.
Israel and Hamas should enter a truce so that the death and destruction can come to an end.
Mohammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France
Absolutely correctly stated
Supposing that Hamas is 100% on the truth, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah. Even then, they should know that if a good deed is resulting in the destruction of an established house, it is no more a good deed.
Those who claim to love God, love the messenger and love their religion, loving mankind is a part of their faith.
As if it is the order of Allah to evacuate all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than the Muslims.
Najibur Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
no there are no orders to destroy but to invite them to come to Islam.
but Jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion.
these people should be fought with unless they stop these conspiracies - but this doesn't mean at all that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering.
brothers, the only end to the killer of innocent children is destruction.
but I ask my friends that the Israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past have become so strong today that they don't listen to any one, this is because the Jews are united.
there are no Shea's and Sunnis, there are all just Jews and they have developed everything in every field.
in contrast, what is the condition of 55 Islamic countries?
they are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death.
it is essential that all Muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
and there is no better strategy, that recognize Israel, learn modern education and means of progress and let the world live in peace and harmony.
The Muslims have plenty of land and means as well.
the need is of proper use.
this first most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque and this was impossible without removing Yasin and Arafat from the way.
the world is witnessing that how Palestine had been scattering  after the death of these two leaders.
and how the Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
In 1974 a Pakistani Prime Minister was of such an International trust that first time in history he united all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance.
Today on his 81st birthday is it hard enough for the nation to promise for unity with each other
but by eliminating the differences between other Muslims will accomplish its (establishment of Islamic Common Wealth) incomplete mission.
its a monster that has gripped Palestine for half a century.
this monster has many faces.
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
and its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
this monster is most unhappy with Islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through Islam, Muslims, the perfect religion of Muslim and Practical Islam as the history tells that Islam has put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since 27th of December.
more that 3 hundred Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
after the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
however the Israeli authorities say that they will continue operation in Gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
in your opinion, is this claim of Israel true that it's doing all this for defending the sovereignty of Israel?
is the world community playing its role in such situation?
does this aggression has an indirect relation with the coming elections in Israel?
can any improvement be expected in the situation in Middle East after the succession of the newly elected American president Barak Obama.

Palestine will forever remain a sacred place for Muslims and its protection is a must for us.
and we should also remember that it is also our Qibla e Awwal.

"when the night of loneliness can be passed by tearing down
when an affliction can be avoided with only prayers" (Nawabzadah Nasrullah Khan)
Such reviews are anxiously telecasted by BBC.
After all the image and prestige of neutralism has to be kept.
Though BBC news are often true but the real thing is the delivery.
What to highlight and which news is given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
Now In this regard our Pakistani print and electronic media, specially few Urdu newspapers and columnists etc. are not behind in the trade who in the coverage or writing of increasing terrorism exaggerate to hell.
has said that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. how long this hypocrisy will continue.
Why is so much oppression being done on the Muslims? If people such as America stop supporting these Jews, then Allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support, and then see what kind of life they get.
All these world renowned leaders and people who murder innocents in the name of peace should realize that peace in the world can only be achieved by justice, and not through injustice or wiping entire races.
If killing a particular race off completely is the answer, then Hitler's plan would not have seen any jews survive, and definitely not seen their rise.
Says a poet
Injustice is injustice. If it breeds, it dies.
Blood is blood. If it bleeds, it dries.
How can anyone define terrorism?
Isn't all this terrorism too? Why does only ones pain seem painful?
Aren't other people human too? So why is only Muslim blood so important? Wasn't all the innocent people's blood red too?
So why are there no disapproval messages now?
I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.
Dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood, how shall we condemn, I can not find words!
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims that on one side people are being killed in India so the rest of the world comes over Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations otherwise we will do it ourselves!
And on the other side, Israel is killing generations of muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent. This is unbearable!
There is delay but not NEVER in the house of God and only then will this darkness shed. Then
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Considering elections, the rulers should do such activities for people's support. There is no doubt in this specially when countries like Israel exist. Rest talking about Barrack Obama, then history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy and nor will do it. Regime, whether black or white, is a regime.
It appears from the conversation of forum that everyone is grieved over Benazir death but as politician her mistakes are not forgotten.
It is debatable that Benazir died for democracy or for power.
If she sacrificed for democracy then why she left democracy in the dictatorship of Musharraf for 10 years till she got a deal and American clearance?
Benazir did not return Pakistan when dictatorship affected people needed her she returned Pakistan when she has the assurances of free from cases and of power.
when each and every historic personality is being accused, there is no one to say any thing over this.
Sana Khan
few things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done of them.

Sir/Sir probably you should not only study Pakistan's history but that of 4 friend and 7 other countries, may be you would agree with Psycho's point of view.

Britain never let them unite and established the Hindu-Muslim conflict which was later on brought up by Sir Syed.
psycho
how brutal is our nation, not only we are blind while writing odes on ourselves and our parties but now we are picking, accusing and criticizing every historical scholar and no body is there to say any thing over this.
enough of development that we have made.
Sana Khan
few things are ignored just by thinking that nothing can be done of them. Just like a donkey can not become a scholar by just loading books over it.
although after the Mumbai attacks, there has been a setback in the dialog between Pakistan and India, however Pakistan and India should continue these dialogs.
if we talk of war then it will bring loss of humans from both sides.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu but on the other hand when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader; point to be noted.
First of all Mary Christmas to Mr. Bhana and to all the Christian brothers of the forum.
greeting to all friends of the Forum: Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, sister Sana, sister Shahida and Mr. Akram.
we do not want the flames of fire but flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
will war give solution to problems.
it will bless with fire and blood.
will give hunger and exigence.
therefore wise humans
its better to avoid war
in yours and ours yards
its better that the glim keeps lightened
the India-America relations have deepened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
this is also the old history of America.
in case of and Indian attack, America would get its goals and the expense would be on India as well.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation and ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
this is the Islamic history.
Before this resolution Pakistani people and army has delivered their message.
Indian struggle for having unusual diplomatic and military benefits in compensation of Mumbai attacks are proving her cunning party then affected. Therefore the world has reduced its pressure on Pakistan contrasting to its initial hard reaction.
UN has expressed faith on Pakistani efforts ignoring the unnecessary lamentation of India and Interpol's appreciation of Pakistani efforts is the 'side effect' of unwanted Indian diplomacy.
there are no two opinions over this that it is a heinous act.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past one year?
Every day, how many Taliban die due to the firing of the thousands of mortar and canon shells they fire?
I appeal to the ICI that they stop their guardianship of the Taliban, for Gods sake, and let us live peacefully in paradise like Swat.
And they stop this fixed operation.
The day is not far when in UN resolution of Army intrusion in Pakistan will be approved just like the one against Jamat Aldawa.
Riaz Ahmed Farooqi
First our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in UN,
and suppose if this resolution took time to approve then considering the example of America any country will launch the attack at her own.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
As the bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are deathless even after being dead.
But here an international game is being played. Here ferrocity and animosity is created to do the ruling.
So there can be reason created that if we are not here then these vandals and animals can come take over the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
America sees the torture of these extremists but instead of being sad on these faithless activities, they easily name them as tribal culture.
The reason for these faithless activities, sometimes given in the name of tribal culture and other times in the name of Islam, is not something done by a person with a heart.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so brave that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also men of God and so is our army.
It is very clear that there is fishy.
instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and lesson gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell,
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Who burnt the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on the refusal of oath after the Prophet (PBUH) passed away and how took her husband by the rope in his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
without accepting reality neither the motives can be diminished nor correction can be made.
O' BBC please stop this dual-headed policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
please show some modesty, a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office.
For the success of Operation Sherdil and across the border the success of Operation Lion Heart depends on the favor of people.
It is carried out by American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahib is a victim of conspiracy.
In this forum all reviews will be against Taliban, Agencies have been successfully indulged in Taliban and are applying the policies which might change public opinion.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public. They even report something like this 'Bombing on Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000, in Swat went there to do.
That the bodies of the Taliban who helps the army is left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake stop this drama.
These Talibans have tarnished the Muslim image.
If in the whole world true Muslims don't call these terrorists as Muslims then how come these elements are able to live in the lands of true Muslims.
Those who become shameless, can't do hard labor they pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
There is no allowance of this in any religion or family traditions.
Including BBC all the media present their views in different styles on Taliban or the tribal people.
But no one is aware of the ground realities or what the truth is. It is us the tribal people who know what rally is the matter.
In short, its a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a talib or a tribal. Who made these institutions? Warmongers who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions.
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute the leader of MQM, Althaf Husain, and the leaderships of ANP and PPP, as they have spoken against this cancer, i.e. the Taliban.
This cancer was given birth to by Zia-ul-Haqq. He has gone, but he has destroyed Pakistan as he went.
But I have hope that the present government will eradicate this cancer.
After Mumbai attacks India said that few extremist groups are involved in these attacks.
Pakistan denied these blames and said that she will fully cooperate in the investigation.
India said that she has provided Pakistan a list of 20 extremists, who are wanted to India.
Noe Pakistan said that leader of Jaish e Muhammad Maulana Masud Azhar present in this list is not detained and Government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before this President Asif Ali Zardari has denied the impression that Western Secret Agencies and Indian Government have provided Pakistan the proves of Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said about Ajmal Qasab that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
During this Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that Indian relation with her can't get better till the time her soil is used for terrorism.
And in recent updates Indian Cricket team has canceled its tour of Pakistan.
Should these political incidents affect sports?
How do you see the future of Pakistan and India relations?
Neither America will break Pakistan nor India.
Pakistan will be broken by Pakistanis themselves.
what do you expect after so much provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism.
although Jinnah also did not do good to the Muslims of India and it has been proven with time.
Yasmin, Chicago.
Madam, if Mr. Jinnah's vision was followed, neither the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism had spread in Pakistan nor the Muslims in India had undergone such behavior.
but it's our fault that we could not bring up a leader like his stature.
if we can not care for our heroes, then
this region has great capabilities.
god knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
in both countries the enemies to peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv sena, RSS have been raised.
and the evil powers don't want this region to progress therefore these countries are controlled like puppets.
can you imagine what status will this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world.
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
may Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
but Sir, open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
moreover, the internal affairs don't seem to be good, as you can see the circumstances in NWFP, Balochistan and in Karachi in Sindh.
in this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
O Allah bestow your mercy upon us.
Account to my understanding, a final war is inevitable.
this is enough of it.
now it should be do or die.
this problem can not be solved through these acts of insincere dialogues.
and not through small scale terrorism in each other's country.
after all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
and if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all of our political parties agree on this matter that these terrorist and denominational activities should be terminated from the country.
But our army rule does not seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, American and Europe are made to believe that we are with you on this war against terrorism and the other hand, we also help Taliban secretly.
We have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way. Thank you.
There is no doubt in this that majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are the members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined  the party  named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.
Although these members preferred subsidiary activities and now after India's great persistence, The United Nation has invalidated it also and Government of Pakistan is continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it is better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
Terrorist groups present in Pakistan, who support professional criminals and the heads of those Mullahs are those who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.
And now they are doing everything to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called Human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan from these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous or not?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose work is only to kill.
Heart is breaking into pieces on this news.
What world is this where it is hard to survive for the one who names an important part of Allah's religion Islam.
Non Muslims can kill Muslim, but if Muslim even tries to take revenge then along with the whole non Muslim world our hypocrite leaders also treat the ones sincere with true and sincere religion like they are treating our great leader Hafiz Saeed now a days.
As a penalty of Mumbai attacks India.
Pakistan relations are affected, and the recent improvement of relations between two countries is enormously shocked.
India has been continually blaming active armed and unarmed groups in Pakistan
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the action against these groups.
Whereas Indian Security agencies has directly blamed Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks
, in this regard Jamat Adawa has also been nominated.
It is not the first time that because of any terrorist attack the relation of these two countries are worsen.
In December 2000 after the attacks on Indian Parliament both countries were at the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashkr e Taiba was banned and was included in terrorists list.
Now Jamat Adawa, to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of Lashkr e Taiba, is demanded to be banned.
What do you think, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against active extremist groups on her soil?
Can by banning Jamat Adawa present India,
Pakistan crisis will vanish and to what extent it is vital to ban armed groups for establishing forever peace between the two countries.
Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly?
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful state.
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salam- Please do it with pleasure but act at your own.
do not do it under American pressure.
if India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
And why it accuses us of every thing?
there are extremist groups and organizations in India as well, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the world?
What India is doing in Kashmir, what is that?
What Israel is doing, what is that?
the truth is; we are the first Nuclear Muslim State and why; this is the main issue.
Pakistan is now in it's last stages.
Kamran Hassan: Abu Dhabi
Your words touch the heart, and the situation seems so.
Now in American publications, the new map of Pakistan is being printed, and all these restrictions are now apparent in the series of events.
The Americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over Pakistan.
In this situation, if we do not stand together and show our unity, then remember, if Bangladesh can be made, then anything can happen.
More the terrorism is condemned lessor it is , whether it is in a Hotel at Mumbai or it is in Marriott Hotel Islamabad or it is in Palestine.
Like wise irrespective of the origin of the terrorist, these should be eliminated, no matter these are Pakistanis or Indian or American or Israelite.
Now the question is that why the whole world including the Pakistani officials are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack carried out on Marriott Hotel was not a terrorist attack?
then why-
Appreciation for Interior Advisor Rehman Malik, Masha Allah he has become very brave!
According to BBC on one hand (a committee of) Security Council of UN has banned Jamat Aldawa, on the other hand Mr. Malik says we didn't impose the ban and if it is to be done will be after through research.
Not this, according to BBC Mr.Malik has strongly denied the impression that arrest of terrorists are taking place because of 'someone's instructions'
Highly appreciated!
whether having the ability or not or to say that I don't want.
We, the Pakistanis are fighting whose war.
and why we have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect.
No one has  a right to interfere anyone's national affairs.
The colonial system is apparently not there.
If people expect justice, or demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan, which I think is not acceptable by those calling for unity.
Pakistan is always following European and American purposes.
This goes on without the approval of many of its citizens.
And it invokes hostile sentiments.
If you believe in the United States of America, then why not just give up your place and leave honorably?
Pakistan has the ability to be armed or unarmed.
Security forces raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
Pressure is being increased on Pakistan for taking rapid action against extremist organizations after Mumbai attacks.
India blames Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Secretary Condolisa Rice asked Pakistani leadership to take practical measures for instant and transparent action against the responsible s of Mumbai attacks.
She says that no doubt the extremists responsible for Mumbai attacks used Pakistani soil.
During this Peshawar Government says that unknown armed persons has set another truck stand for supply of goods to Allied Forces deployed in Afghanistan on fire, due to which more then fifty vehicles are destroyed.
It is the second attack on Neto and American supplies during 48 hours in Peshawar.
During this Pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from Karachi to Tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action.
It is revealed that during the reign of General Zia ul Huq because of the invasion of the ex USSR in Afghanistan and its resistance started by the American and Saudi funding resulted in the birth of armed groups of which Pakistan unable to terminated could not get back herself to the era before 1980s.
The question is does Pakistan want to do it?
Is Pakistan capable of doing this?
What do you think?

I have only one question for the standard bearers of the world.
If you kill their children, will they come to garland you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill innocent public, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in negative, then you really need to fix your viewpoint.
Peoples were armed at that time it was feared that after Afghanistan, Russia will attack Pakistan so people were armed.
Now when there is the danger of American attack via Afghanistan of which current American President clearly expressed in his presidential campaign then why should we disarm these people?
Only for this that after defeating Pakistani Army America or India may not face any public resistance?
Yes, if any of them is involved in sabotage activities then only Pakistan should take action against him.
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
And another question is that were these terrorists not supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As for as Lashkr e Taiba is concerned ongoing terrorism is not linked to it.
It must be recalled that Hafiz Saeed was the first 'Militant Leader' who declared activities of Taliban 'revolt'.
I am quite sure that Taliban agitation is a vital part of American plans so every person or organization must be eliminated who challenges Taliban in any aspect.
Despite the cooperation of the whole nation action against Lashkr due to the pressure of India indicates the nervousness and flatterness of Zardari and Co.
To terminate the expedition started by the American and Saudi funding, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society.
Also protest them that by what ethics American and Saudis are spreaded dangerous arms and so called Jihadi but in fact the virus of  loathsome literature and culture, due to which human butcher houses established in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly. And tried its best that India should attack Pakistan.
This shattered the confidence of America in the area.
Although India did not even threatened nor it has the guts to.
And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of Taliban or American posts.
Thus it was proven that without the support of Pakistan and its army, America can not do anything.
Karachi Business Financial Center of Pakistan is Dubai of underdeveloped areas.
Hundreds of thousand never return empty pocket from here, but since the grip of law has weekend in Western Frontier areas all eyes are on Karachi.
Now they are about to kidnap this city.
First time Pathans are named Pakhtoon, residents of a city are involved in fighting like strangers, although need of the time is unity.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speaking learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu, or its better that everybody learns English.
You must be thinking its a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
that the cause of the torture would be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir in my childhood I had actually given the same suggestion many times to my friends ,which included people from every religion and rhetoric groups, but my friend people used to laugh over these suggestions.
at that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not that live and powerful but they were boiling inside.
Can't understand what and why it is happening?
Are these the indicators of Dooms day.
By what reason innocents are dieing?
Every one knows the causes those who want to destroy Pakistan are involved and those who commit all this have no religion or country.
Either Karachi or Mumbai it is an inside job.
Every upcoming government gets herself involved in changing the names of places, like now a days airport, roads, buildings all Benazir.
Is this the meaning of Benazir which is happening in Karachi and to the peoples of Pakistan?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awaken sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
Where reaction full of patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties have taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time they have also given American planners one more chance to think.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the worse situation in Karachi and administration is not neutral.
Administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately
, police and rangers don't take action because of political parties pressure.
To unite is only expressed in speeches, political parties should have to quit their interests and work for common people.
Till the end administration is under political pressure such incidents will increase, Allah bless Pakistan.
I think these people are the biggest terrorists.
and foreign powers are definitely involved in this but no one knows who they are?
but alas that if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there, but since its not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
the government should operate here and save a large and very important city of the country from terrorism
otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
BBC Urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure and Pakistani media's condition is already weak.
the whole truth is there on BBC English.
one solution to the problem is that either Urdu speakers should learn Pushto or Pushto speaking learn Urdu or better if every body learns English.
you will definitely take is as a funny suggestion but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
that language is the reason of violence?
There was another story of cruelness recorded in Karachi, terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
Wherever one could do something, he did everything. Reports on the media are 50% of what has happened here in four days.
Stayed awake in the last four nights and still afraid.
Who evacuated hotels, killed cobblers peanut sellers.
causing depredation on Super highway and cutting off ears of the innocents are all not aware of the punishment of Allah, which will catch them one day.
In your opinion, what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
Placing in front of us the heart struck attacks of Bombay, we certainly do not have to dive to find the reasons for this disturbance in Karachi. But there is one simple and easy reason that this disturbance was the result of spilling of blood subconsciously.
It is evident that if some one will knock kneed with the father, it is not unusual for the son to get out of control.
Liaqat Ali Khan and many devotees also belonged to there,for correcting the misunderstanding of Mr. Psycho I am quoting a verse
We also will follow our ancestors
sacrificed for her existence and will sacrifice to save her.
Faizan Taufiq Siddiqui
It is very sad, the whole country is at stake while we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui for your kind information if Wikipedia.
org is searched for Liaqat Ali Khan, you will know that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family of an area of Punjab Karnal.
Due to his services for Muhajirs, they consider him their leader.
there is always a reaction to every action.
one can afford on oneself but.
Ejaz Aiwan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan, they did not face any reaction.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
Only Muslim League (N) was left, she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to Peoples Party.
Before this MQM and Muslim League (Q) has already submitted the draft of 18th amendment in assembly and senate.
Till now it appears that 18th amendment was a political move and none of the party is sincere in its approval.
This is why nobody has raised voice in the favor of this amendment in senate or assembly and neither forced the House to approve the amendment.
It seems that by submitted the draft of 18th amendment these parties has beaten around the bushes means they can claim that we had submitted the amendment but the ruling party's speaker did not proceed.
MQM an ally of government, Muslim League (N) secret friend and Muslim League (Q) has approved the 17th amendment, then how is it possible that they are sincere in removing 17th amendment.
It is like painting red to be counted amongst martyred.
Peoples Party is not what so ever in a hurry to remove 17th amendment.
Nobody can think of cutting his own hands.
As long Zardari is President 17th amendment will be there.
It was majority's opinion in our one survey and a fact too.
If 17th amendment ought to be removed then Zardari wont become president.
Now he is more powerful then President Pervez as along with the President he is the Chairman of Peoples Party.
Till he is president 17th amendment is there.
For removing 17th amendment political parties has to depart President Zardari from President house first.
Neither MQM wants it nor the other parties.
most of the elders from our family belonged to the labor community.
in our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor work, we used to pray to Allah: that please save us from this hard labor work.
to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what should we do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor work.
the editor wrote in reply that we should select certain subjects and become doctors or engineers.
right from beginning my trend was towards engineering and I had selected technical drawing instead of Biology in metric as well.
but at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.
I studied Biology for hardly a month and then when nothing worked out, I took maths as an alternate subject.
means that the fear from labor work made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.
I remembered that when I along with my two sons were trying to remove the carpets from our old house.
It was not even 30 minutes for us working that our younger son said “Dad it feels like I am not born for this job.
We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.
Son started saying that I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work .
Three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home.
What it means is that when a man decides the destination no matter what were the motives behind this no one can stop him from getting it.
But if you don’t even know what you have to do then God be with you.
It is said that don't accuse the dead, but can't help it as we see only evils in her on the first anniversary of Benazir.
On one side Benazir crushed independence movement of Sikhs by handing over the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India for her own sake and on the other hand provided India an opportunity to fully concentrate in Kashmir after crushing the movement in Punjab.
The greed of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years.
During her exile Benazir continued to give negative statements on Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir made a deal with Pervez Musharraf while betraying the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif.
During her reign Benazir provided her husband the opportunity of making money and because of this he popularized as Mr. 10 percent.
Benazir brother was killed during her reign whose assassins are still safe.
Though a woman still Benazir avoided to fight for the rights of women.
Just like Benazir politicized her father's dead body similarly his widower husband politicizing her dead body.
Benazir reigned twice but not only she failed to punish her father's political murder but could not file a case against them.
it has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
what should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated 16th December as a didactic day and take such measures that this kind of incident don't take place again.
on this day we could send greeting to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again.
the rulers would reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Bahari's stuck in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines of life from the next day.
Only if East and West Pakistan could be one together just like East and West Germany was united once again.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be granted in the near future.
Today when it was told in the news that Governor of American State Illinois has been arrested for charges of corruption
and to remove him from governorship provincial Congress is preparing for his rapid accountability, our American friend who has a keen interest in Pakistani affairs exaggeratedly said to me 'see this is democracy'.
No one is beyond the law in America.
and here is your country Pakistan whose president was dropped of the corruption charges before sworn in.
My sense of humor rouse and I said what's strange if a governor has been arrested in America, in our Pakistan prime minister was arrested overnight and once was hanged and second time was exiled.
Tell me, has it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan the country law breaker has been departed from President House with guard of honor, tell me has it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan Chief Justice has been dismissed as despite of public support he is not reinstated yet, has this ever happened in America?
In Pakistan fake degree holder has become the Health Minister, did this happen in America?
By hearing this American laughed like mads and also accepted his defeat.
in this picture, president Zardari is smiling despite of being surrounded by the Americans from all four sides.
it looks from his smile
He is thinking that America is supporting his government but he is forgetting that a year ago they were with Pervez Musharaf.
This picture was passed on, as if it was of some family.
Previously, such a photo was never printed in newspapers before, i.e. one president with three American agents.
It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.
It is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.
If it was a smart ruler, at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo, and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting.
If the rules of democracy are implemented on this photo, President Zardari is in minority.
According to democracy, the majority are the rulers of the country, and the photo is speaking for itself who that is?
Paradise-like Swat is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
According to the government tactic so far, along with force, discussions have been going on.
But the use of force is not giving any benefit other than increasing the force of the Taliban and increasing the public favor for them.
what needs to be done is that the government, instead of using the power, should eliminate the causes of the issue.
by eliminating the causes Fazlullah and Taliban will automatically finish.
the Sharia bill proposed by ANP will become the solution of the problems of Swat to a great extent.
But besides implementation of the Sharia, the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues.
from the early steps of General Musharaf, it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians, but the lust of power changed all his plans.
all the hopes were from the participation in the "war of terror", he had started considering himself as immortal.
those steps which were expected, all broke-off.
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, he made a deal with the thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army but never know what's happening to the present government.
Either its Bajor or Swat, the army does not control terror but bombs the "Enemy" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy a mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy.
In Swat, the strongly affected part of Sarhad state, despite the continuity of military action for over one year, the situation is still going from bad to worse.
On one side, the government is only reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly. On the other side, the Taliban's illegal radio FM channel is having much more influence in the region.
On the third side, the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region.
During the action of the security forces, there were claims of destroying the fundamentalists by the bombing of gun ship helicopters and cannon houses, but despite these destructions, the Taliban only became more powerful, and according to an estimation, their control over Swat increased that much percent more.
As a result, on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat, and on the other hand the Taliban is stronger.
Who is stuck in  between? The poor civilians.
It is said in Swat, that someone asked what kind of people are the Taliban were, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of Allah and the religion'.
Then he asked how the army was, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country'.
He then asked who the enemies of the religion and the country were, so he got the answer, 'We civilians'.
I am wondering how the Pakistani Army will fight the Indian Army, when they couldn't control a small faction of the Taliban.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
But still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
After the girls schools, now boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfews are called so that the Taliban can move around easily.
During curfew tonight, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
The question arises as to how they got there despite the curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone explain to the army to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the Army can defeat any enemy.
He says, maximum bloodshed has been done on the base of religion, you tell me in the absence of any religion wont bloodshed occur?
Punjabi, Pathan. white and black, Mehsud and other tribes, are all these created by religion?
Not at all, sir, religion preaches us that there is no white, black, Punjabi or Muhajir, if there is no religion then half of the world would have been destroyed by the war of black and white and remaining half by the war of cast.
Actually religion nourishes human morally and restricts him that he is not here at his own rather is sent by The Creator of Universe and he has to live by God's rules.
As a Muslim I believe that Islam is true religion and a complete code of life.
After living in London, for many years I used to ask wellness of my family over the telephone every morning. Although many did not even call once to find out how we were. Then I realized that they do not even tolerate our phone calls so we stopped calling.
Living here in France for the last two years, I have also felt the same thing.
Do not know why people expect us to call.
A resolution passed about Iraq in a few hours, Darfar has absolutely no problem in sending peace army.
Bombay attacks were condemned in no time and banning dubious groups is only a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are doing consensus.
O caretakers of international peace! life is finishing here!
is it really being waited to diminish.
so that any again no aggrieved could even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights.
when a father is running carrying his beloved sons dead body, even then your hearts don't pinch you with pain?
If not then you don't even deserve to be called human being.
but you are a black mottle over the name of humanity.
so atleast this has been proven that this region has also been a homeland for Jews for centuries.
ideally these two nations should have lived in harmony but since their strings are in Western and Arab hands, so without their will peace can not prevail in this region.
and now even Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
even if the Israeli operation stops temporarily, it will start again any moment after any incident.
The interests of BBC homeland are affiliated to America and Israel and this is why under the wrapper of 'broadmindedness' it has produced a series of blogs consisted of 'Jewish favor' and is conducting one sided and blind 'propaganda'.
BBC is only carrying the 'formality' and its objective is to have sympathies!
It is requested to Mr. Moderator that he must publish this review so that it may be proved BBC has element of realism to some extent.
Thanks.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How could I not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time, including Derah Gahzi Khan, summer showers are taking place throughout the country.
here is a poem according to the weather, enjoy the weather along with this poem.
These rains are with your presence.
if it rains, its spring
if it stays then its peace
sometimes comes without a reason
at times spread over day and night
sometimes very noisy and sometimes very quiet
These rains are with your presence.
in a memory, at a night
to a buried ash
Sometimes it was such, that the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burnt itself.
Sometimes each drop seems sorrowful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What is it to them, whether the country lasts or not.
Whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them.
For one, our media is also corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government, and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday noon strange thing happened.
The whole police was running here and there but was least bothered about illegal parking.
Not this, NYPD traffic was not in the mood of noticing illegally parked vehicles.
What happened was, an airplane of US Air crash landed in the Hudson River.
Till now the only information pulled out was, ""the terrorists"" were of goose breed.
Yesterday it might be the historic cold in New york.
The temperature does not fall to this extent.
My jaw start to ache because of half an hour outside walk.
Just imagine what would have happened with those who jumped of the plane into the river.
A matter of relief as all the people were safe.
The dark side is that the Company's plane crashed in this financial crises.
While watching all this I went to New Jersey by West Side Highway. I Noticed that South Bound is blocked, still what I did?
Yes, I was jammed in it on my way back.
Thanks God,during my an hour trip the road was bit cleared as I get an exit from 56 street.
Otherwise I did not avail the first two exit due to the long lanes of vehicles.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women
Shaguftah: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I have slaughtered two chickens and how they are slaughtered, Jahanzeb has already mentioned.
Apart from this, there is no other way.
At this farm, one has to get his own meat done,, including removing the skin.
Basim: .Net might take some to repair.
what happened on the forum?
Linko
in order to work with Listen to Blog, see it in Fire Fox.
Duffer: same to you, Eid Greetings to you.
Sir please use Fire Fox.
the snow will vanish.
we unnecessarily kept thinking of these Taliban of Swat as indelicate but who were only unhappy over women's education.
they kept expressing their grief by demolishing a women's school and college somewhere every day.
but just like other ideas, this idea did not also come true, according to this report by CNN, today on the sacred day of Monday this Taliban gang of Swat have blasted a boy's school.
Swat, The Taliban has destroyed a boys school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Amen, then Amen.
Masha Allah, up till now, 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom of fixing marriages before birth among Muslims, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See a picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
just a while before this, the wedding of a dog with a girl took place.
look at that groom.
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
Today is the age of computer and computer's interference is growing in every aspect of life.
Lots of people have many reservations about this growing interference of computer like in financial issues.
As you have facilities for using credit cards but by this law enforcement agencies has also firmer grip on your private life.
That just by tracking the record of your credit card you can be exposed.
And in future when use of currency will be minimal its utility will increase.
Similarly in crimes world there is no need to rob the bank, information of credit card are hacked.
Similarly friendship has become computerized
, social networking websites like Orcet, Facebook and MySpace are ranked first in popularity.
But don't you feel that the more closer we are getting of these sites mentally, practically moving further away from people.
Similarly there is the website of match making, where by knowing your choice you are provided with a list of people according to your likings.
Can you spend life with your own cologne (of course not physical)?
I can't do it, that is why a life partner is known as better half.
That he/she may cover my deficiencies.
Perhaps I have got a small share of sense.
I used to believe everything someone elder says.
In the same way, I thought that my father knew the answer to every question on earth.
I used to get laughed at a lot for this.
But only that seems true which can be possible.
It is very troubling, that what is the need to tell lies.
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
That is why I try to lie as less as possible.
that I do not falsely please others, that too with the name of Allah.
And that I say Insha Allah (If God Wills) only when I am asking Allah to complete the work.
As for the intentions, only Allah knows best.
This is a despicable matter that arose due to distance from religion.
According to both our religion and Pakistani law, young children should stay with their mothers.
Their expenses are to be borne by the father, and the father can meet his children.
then when they become mature, they live with whom they wan to live.
You are right that the actual problem are the relatives who misguide.
feudalism has overshadowed our deeds.
Even here is thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in father's property so it is resisted, although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated.
here these restriction regarding making of relations have created many evils in the society.
concept of remarriage of a divorced or a widow is getting rare.
due these unnecessary beliefs and tradition the family system is facing disarray.
in our society, if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarry, then why it is not appreciated?
there is a Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago, now after getting all his children married when he married a widow, his own children have gone against him.
In my opinion, this is religious right, what do you say?
What type of mentality is the 'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place', kind of mentality?
I believe that this persons children should have thought what is wrong if he married a widow, after he married off all his children?
Thereby, this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
As the children would definitely have gotten busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow if their wives refuse to look after them, when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is a curse in our society in which we are sunk since last 40 to 50 years.
Even a wife is agreed on the unethical activities of her husband but does not allow her for second marriage.
If she had the power She wont allow him of this even after her death.
Along with husband spoils her afterlife too and causes an increase in corruption in society.
Nothing happens with singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.
And about your question, when sir instead of bringing his wife home, goes to someone else's wife so the dependents just make a fuss for the show and stay quiet and satisfied. ( yeah, later the relatives of the wife get angry)
In IndopPak we embraced Islam centuries ago but can't get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then Islam.
Second marriage of man as ridiculous, divorce as stigma, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as disgrace and man's marriage with an elder woman as the result of her cunningness is all because of such thinking.
Moreover to copy the western nations we declare veil and worship backward.
It was easy to embrace Islam to get rid of such thinking is very difficult.
Allah bless us all the courage for it.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never that difficult.
Centuries passed in writing this little.
Consider it enough.
Allah Hafiz.
Ameer Taimur in his book "I am Taimur" writes I found the secret in my living time that if the commander of any army is present on the front line then that army will never be defeated.
But here the things are altogether different.
They say the population is by default for getting killed for us.
If anyone dies from the population, it is considered Murder.
May peace and blessing of Almighty be upon you.
I was coming back to my shop after the Isha prayer tonight, a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called.
I thought that probable this man has lost his way or wants to ask something, I stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car.
he asked me if I could speak and understand Arabic, I said no problem, you tell me what's up?
he started telling that he has come from Riyadh and here in Medina someone picked my pocket, kindly help me. I said please go away brother, since such an incident has already taken place with me that I gave this man 12 riyals so that he could reach Riyadh, but he started doing the same after moving a little farther.
I was furious, I cursed him and threatened him of the Police, then he ran away.
this is the situation of Muslims now that even for begging we ride our cars along with our families and make at least 2 to 3 thousand a day.
However there is a clear Hadith (SAAW) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one.
May Allah bless us and make us true Muslims (Amen)
Wassalam

Washington...
top American officials say that president Obama will take strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
in the new American policy over Afghanistan, there is more emphasis on war than development.
officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achievement of American goals Since in his government, there is corruption, drugs business has increased and Taliban are regaining their power.
American officials say that people, who are putting more pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more, include vice president Joe Biden and President Obama's representative for Afhanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke.
He said that this good administration was noticed after the President Bush left, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai after every 2 weeks and used to emphasize on the role of America in Afghanistan and the development of its city departments.
Officials say that Obama management will work with the state leaders as a backup with the main government.
Officials say that they will emphasize Hamid Karzai on fighting against corruption
Hamid Karzai faces new elections this year. And it is not clear as yet that Obama and his companions will favor his presidency or not.
Is this statement, of the American officials, a forecast of change in American policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is this era of Hamid Karzai ending?
What are your thoughts in this matter?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and SriLanka, Srilanka defeated Pakistan with 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Srilanka in the first one-day match although Srilanka won in the next two matches.
In this third one-day match, the nation's team performance was very poor. They worn out in only 75 runs in 23 overs against 309 runs made by the national team of Srilanka.And this is how we faced a lesson learning defeat.
the result of the series proves that the National team has no consistency in its performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
which departments of the game should be addressed more by the authorities?
are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
which department you will hold responsible for the defeat, fielding, batting or bowling?
please provide your feedback.
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish  traditions continue. these feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule, who would call them Muslims?
a Sardar should walk himself over these embers. why the present government do not act against them?
when the judicial justice will come in handy.
the Srilankan cricket team has arrived Karachi to play One Day internationals.
besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
upon reaching the Karachi airport, the Srilankan team was very warmly welcomed.
two one days between Pakistan and Srilanka in Karachi whereas the third one day will be played in Lahore.
both teams have there claims over bowling, batting and fielding.
if the Srilankans are proud of their spinners, the Pakistanis trust their fast bowlers.
Srilankan Captain Mahela Jayvardena has said that not a single player from Pakistan team but the whole team is dangerous.
Murli dharan and Mendis will be the trump cards whereas the Pakistan Captain says that it will be a tough competition.
Shoaib Malik has said that we have played Murli dharan and we'll see Mendis as well. we have prepared a secret game plan and we shall implement that in the ground.
will the Pak-Srilanka Series be really as interesting and exciting as the claims are?
who will be dominate the series between Pakistan and Srilanka?
Who will win the series?
Who will be man of the series?
Inform us of your suggestions.
Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.
Malik Yusuf, Dubai.
How is all this is double for these people, when the Kashmiri people have been fighting for independence for the last 60 years?
No, no one asked, and they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism, so they start talking about making up.
First they openly killed the Muslims, now they are in the efforts of setting things right.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies.
Asad Khan: London
India is creating such a situation that the world's attention can be diverted from Kashmir.
but Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now the British Government is also understanding that the Indians are taking cover from their occupation over Kashmir by blaming Pakistan of terrorism.
and they hesitate to talk to Pakistan over this issue.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that by resolving the issue of Kashmir will bring an end to extremism, the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
it should be clear that the newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister while talking to media in Mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Is India using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialog?
Let us know of your opinion.
Usman Aftab.
I think Super powers don't want to destroy Pakistan
rather they are thinking of certain policies to control her they are familiar that Pakistan is an atomic power
want to bring some sort of revolution
Foreign countries believe that by cornering Pakistan few hurdles may generate want to support Pakistan and also wish to achieve their goal
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn Pakistan.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.
Faheem Siddiqi
Ras al Khaima, This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is in how deep waters.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers movement not played any role?
What do you have to say about this statement of the Prime Minister?
Make us aware about your opinion.
American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference advised newly elected President Barack Obama saying that he had made many mistakes in his presidency, and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
'I did, as a president, whatever I felt was appropriate, according to the situation, and the American law and constitution, giving preference to American interest over my own acceptance'.
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him, and considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this is my last press conference, and I thank the journalists and other friends who are present in the press conference.
Do you think Obama will not repeat the mistakes that Bush made?
Did Bush delay accepting his mistake?

It is extremely sad that the Israelis are openly killing Palestinians. Over here, Kashmir is in the same situation but the Peace Council does not even turn a ear over it.
All the groups that are in Kashmir and Palestine, should keep the war going for freedom, and unitedly fight any force that opposes them. One day their martyrdom will bear fruit, God willing.
Israeli air attacks are still continued on Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
The important leader of Hamas Nazaar Rayyan and family has been martyred.
The Security Council session ended without any decision.
America has opposed the censure resolution against Israel submitted by Lebia and other Arab countries in the session.
Israeli airplanes bombardment is continued since many days on Palestinian civil population.
The whole world reacted on Mumbai attacks but no country including America and England can see bloodshed caused by Israeli attacks.
Why the major countries of Muslim world are silent?
What will you wish to say on this double standard of the world.

I think that actually, most of our people are illiterate. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties, the electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The crisis of electricity and gas has worsen in whole of the Pakistan
, on the other hand gas prices have been raised by average 8, while in few cities unavailability of petrol created immense worry for people.
Intense reactions, riots and torturous demonstration are continued in the industrial and business circles of Pakistan against the crisis of electricity and gas.
Industrialists have threatened a shutdown ultimatum.
In Karachi people are worried due to 8 to 10 hours load shedding.
Industrial sector is almost paralyzed.
Government Institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other.
Increasing the prices of electricity and gas is not a joke with people?
Why the solutions of the problems are not considered?
Is government not seeing the full stop on national development?
What steps you will instantly recommend for managing this crisis?

the Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, in an interview with Jeev News said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour, but due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step? Should sports not be separated from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision not harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that the security condition in India is bad, the England cricket team is continuing its tour, so why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?

Salman, Karachi
Those people who are proud about going to India
and they make their films and videos over there, their eyes should open now, as to how much the people of India respect you.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami should return to Pakistan first chance he gets because respect did not suit you there either.

Indian's attitude has changed after Bombay Attacks.
Jagjit Singh has showed his reaction in this way that he hates Pakistan and Pakistani.
One should know that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsley. How is he a bad singer now? Adnan Sami Should stay in India, there is not need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshaad Alam
Karachi, On the statement of Jagjit Singh, I would only say that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Bombay incident, there hateful statements have increased. The same people are now saying evil against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to foreign news agency the situation has become funny when President Bush along with Prime Minister Noor Almalki in press conference at his office in Baghdad when an Iraqi journalist said to President Bush, ""Dog, this is farewell kiss"".
After this journalist removed his shoe and threw it at Bush, President bush expertly moved his head out of the way and saved himself.
Second shoe hit the American flag.
Security officials dragged him out of there.
On this occasion President Bush said I don't know why he did this, shoe was of size 10, I was not bothered.
Do you think that this action by the journalist depicts the anger of Iraqi people against President Bush.
What will you say about this?

It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she changed totally.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party, and made her son the representative of Peoples Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi, This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
But until the iron ax is not fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are just like this, that they are adopting secretive ways. This is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations have included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed as well as two other Pakistani citizens and that of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organisations into the list of terrorists.

Apart from this, a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organisations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organisations, they will be restricted from traveling and will be under arrest.
They will have to face cases.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India blaming these parties for the Bombay attacks without any proof?
Aren't there any terrorist groups in India?
Are International groups not aware of the tortures being done on the minorities in India?

Karachi, our leaders should understand this that people, they are doing the operation against, are the true valuers of Pakistan, who are tolerating all kinds of tortures but they love Pakistan.
If there would be war then they will fight for Pakistan.
When their love would be felt, just condenming politics will not work. I think between both, there might be going a resulting war.
