   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reid who has worked in the Lever national laboratory of America as a Weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the Ex director of technical intelligence at Las Elmos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.</seg>
    <seg id="3">this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">in an interview with US news, Thomas Reid said that in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's rule, China experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reid said that based to many reasons, he has a belief that China had experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">the reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">he further added that this was the reason that in 1998 only in a span of two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments as a reply to Indian nuclear experiments.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that in May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with a lot of care and Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reed was asked this question that China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan so he said in his answer that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that its evidence is also present that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan has used the Chinese model. Later the documents received from Libya also confirm this.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Another question that is it common to do nuclear experiments mutually. Then he said that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that we also predict that Israel also has access to the results of this experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reeds was also asked if China is continuing nuclear proliferation?</seg>
    <seg id="15">On this Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and the design to a nuclear facility of Iran in its city Asfahan.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.</seg>

On the other side, Germany has also sent its special ambassador to Middle East. European Union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Its evidence is the reaction of Israel who does not pay an importance to the conciliation efforts of the EU.</seg>

     <seg id="1">most of the elders from our family belonged to the labor community.</seg>
     <seg id="2">in our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor work, we used to pray to Allah: that please save us from this hard labor work.</seg>
     <seg id="3">to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what should we do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor work.</seg>
     <seg id="4">the editor wrote in reply that we should select certain subjects and become doctors or engineers.</seg>
     <seg id="5">right from beginning my trend was towards engineering and I had selected technical drawing instead of Biology in metric as well.</seg>
     <seg id="6">but at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.</seg>
     <seg id="7">I studied Biology for hardly a month and then when nothing worked out, I took maths as an alternate subject.</seg>
     <seg id="8">means that the fear from labor work made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.</seg>
     <seg id="9">I remembered that when I along with my two sons were trying to remove the carpets from our old house.</seg>
     <seg id="10">It was only half an hour since he started working that the little boy said " Daddy, I am not born to do this"</seg>
     <seg id="11">I said that if this is true then study a lot like us and get rid of the physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="12">The son said, "I am studying and I will get through it also but it is the work that I can not do"</seg>
     <seg id="13">Whatsoever we did that work in three hours  and came back home.</seg>
     <seg id="14">The point of saying is that if a person picks his destiny, whatever is the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving that destiny.</seg>
     <seg id="15">Here if you do not know what you have to do then God help you!</seg>

     <seg id="1">It is said that do not say bad about the dead. But what shall we do, we see only bad things in Benazir even on her first death anniversary.</seg>
     <seg id="2">Benazir, for her selfish purpose, crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs after giving the list of their names who were fighting for freedom on one hand and on the other gave India the chance to keep its full attention on Kashmir after them helping to suppress Punjab Movement.</seg>
     <seg id="3">Tug of war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history, which has pushed the country back many years.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Benazir continued to give negative comments on Kashmir and the nuclear program after being exiled.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.</seg>
     <seg id="6">during her rule, Benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make as much money that is why he is known as Mr. Ten percent.</seg>
     <seg id="7">during Benazir's rule his brother got killed but his murderers are still safe from any punishment.</seg>
     <seg id="8">besides being a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.</seg>
     <seg id="9">just like Benazir did her politics over her fathers dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.</seg>
     <seg id="10">Benazir came into power twice but she could not punish her the culprits of her father's political murder even she couldn't register a case against them.</seg>

     <seg id="1">it has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.</seg>
     <seg id="2">what should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated 16th December as a didactic day and take such measures that this kind of incident don't take place again.</seg>
     <seg id="3">on this day we could send greeting to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again.</seg>
     <seg id="4">the rulers would reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.</seg>
     <seg id="5">They used to make arrangements to bring back the Bahari's stuck in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.</seg>
     <seg id="6">But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.</seg>
     <seg id="7">We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.</seg>
     <seg id="8">Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines of life from the next day.</seg>
     <seg id="9">Only if East and West Pakistan could be one together just like East and West Germany was united once again.</seg>

     <seg id="2">all the hopes were from the participation in the "war of terror", he had started considering himself as immortal.</seg>
     <seg id="3">those steps which were expected, all broke-off.</seg>
     <seg id="4">as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, he made a deal with the thieves.</seg>

     <seg id="4">The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.</seg>

     <seg id="6">In between who got grinded, the poor citizens.</seg>
     <seg id="7">It is said that in Swat somebody asked, which type of people are the Taliban's are? The answer was  "very good people because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country".</seg>
