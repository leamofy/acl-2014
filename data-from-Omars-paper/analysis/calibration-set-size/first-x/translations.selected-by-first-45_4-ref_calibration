First nuclear test was done in 1990
Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.
In this book, called 'Nuclear Express', the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.
Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News, that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Thomas Reid said that due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Among the factors are the design of the bomb, and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.
He further added that that was the reason that Pakistan was able to reply to India's Nuclear test with a nuclear test in just 2 weeks and 3 days.
Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961, Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test, in response to which America took 17 days to preform a test, despite having this bomb for a long time.
He added that the atom bomb that was tested on May 19th 1998 by Pakistan was made very carefully and that Pakistani scientists had complete reliance on it.
When Thomas Reid was asked whether China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said because India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.
He said that there was proof available that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and later on the documents which were received from Libya also verify this fact.
Upon another question, as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.
He said that we also believe that Israel also has access to the results of this testing.
Thomas Reid was also asked about China's nuclear distribution program which is going on.
Upon that Thomas Reid said that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Asfahan, Iran since 1991.
Apart from this, China provided Iran with the nuclear enrichment plant in Kheraj.
He said that China has been providing Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt and Libya with nuclear technology through North Korea.

Protest against the removal of journalists
On Tuesday the organization of journalists, RIUJ held protests in front of the Islamabad Press Club of journalists and newspaper workers against media owners and the government about the news channel and newspapers removing many of their employees.
Speaking to the protesters, senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, Federal Union of Journalists,  C.R. Shamsi said that the politicians who used to protest with us till yesterday on the streets, today they have become rulers and are sitting in the parliament. Fearing a certain lobby of the media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of the journalists.
He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of Rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.
An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.
He said that there should be firm steps taken against the TV and newspaper owners, and the journalists should put a protest camp in front of the parliament to get their rights.
C.R. Shamsi criticized the governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, saying that employees were removed from his Urdu Newspaper 'Aaj Kal' staff, without prior notice.
Wheras Junah daily, Khabrein daily, Channel 5, Burns Plus TV and Aaj TV have removed dozens of workers.
Speaking to the protestors, the General Secretary of PUFJ said that today, throughout the country, journalist organizations are observing a black day against the removal of journalists and newspaper workers, whereas journalists will go to the parliamentary session wearing black bands on their arms to get back their rights.
According to Mazhar Abbas, in 50% of the Pakistani newspapers and TV channels the workers and journalists were being exploited, where they work without any agreement.
He said that till now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been removed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is being feared that the owners will remove hundreds more in the present year, making an excuse of the present financial crisis.
Mazhar Abbas said that the journalist movement will continue, until removed employees are not reinstated, the newspaper workers wages fixed by the seventh Wage board award is not enforced, and the salaries for many months payable to TV channels and newspaper workers is not paid.

Simon said that Gaza's calamity is not Israel, but Hamas, who have established a dangerous dictatorship over there.
A BBC journalist from Davos said that he had never seen such a scene in an global economic forum before.
However, Erdogan later stated that he respected the Israeli president and his age, which is why he did not scream at him, but whatever he was saying was very far from the truth
Turkey is one of the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, but for the last few years there has been tension between them.

The role of European Union for the peace in Middle East
Officially European Union plays a decisive role in the mediatory efforts taken for stopping the war in Middle East.
According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of Sarkozy are helping hands in this process.
European Union spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said every single step which may help in delivering the conjoint message of European Union to fighting parties is appreciable.
Officially everything seems fine.
But in fact European Union is portraying a picture of internal tension, stress and strain.
The role of Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak
plus internal affairs has made her helpless.
On the other hand the course of action of French President Sarkozy depicts that France is still the President of European Union.
Although 6 months Presidency tenure of France is over.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role which he is capable of, but he isn't the authority.
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner is facing the funniest side.
He is in the delegation which is led by Schwarzenberg the Foreign Minister of Czech Republic.
In addition to that, the two foreign ministers are giving different statements on the war in Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend herself, while according to Kouchner war is not the defense. Germany has also sent a special ambassador to Middle East. As long as European Union does not show unanimous stand, she can not be successful on diplomatic front.
The prove is the no lift conduct of Israel to mediatory efforts of European Union.
This is the best time for European Union to prove herself, as America has failed in Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.
Financial crisis: German millionaire industrialist's suicide
Adolf Marclay, resident of Swabia in south Germany has left behind a huge industrialist group.
But he was not known to German public a while back.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks for weeks regarding his debts towards industrial groups, he became the hot news and could see the dark future for Marckay group.
Marclay Group had to bear the loss of hundreds of million euros after it bought the shares of one of known industry Folks Wigan.
then the financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed 100 Million and 1 billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on Marclay.
Recently the same banks accepted to provide loan to Marclay group on urgent basis but Adolf Marclay who started as a small industrialist to reach a place where his industrial group's annual income reached 30 billion euros, couldn't bear the the loss in his financial strength.

He named his company Ratiopharm which is now Germany's most successful and biggest pharmaceutical company.
Till recent times this phamasutical company had a budget of around 5 to 6 billion euros and even now it is earning around 8 billion euros annually. After the great success of Rasue farm the Marclay Group bought many big industries like Hi-Del Barag Cement a manufacture of construction equipment. Kassbohrer and other good car maker
Marclay Group has a employee number of around 100 thousand around the world and among its industries, Rasue Farm has always been given special importance.
Adolf Marclay has said this many times in his life. ""We have been in pharma business since four generations"".
Now the industry is handled by the children and i hope that it continues to work for few hundred years by our family.
After the suicide of Adolf Marclay,the banks have given approval of temporary loan of 400 million euro for his group VEM but on this condition that VEM have to be sold to  Rasio Farm so that the financial position of this group is improved on long term basis.

According to recent statistics the crime rate of foreigners between 2004 to 2007 .22
9 percent has reduced to .21
4 percent.
According to Joachim Herrmann the Interior Minister of Bavaria it is only an apparent positive change.
He said: It must be considered that foreigners having the German citizenship are increasing.
So it must be added in the statistics that though the criminal is a German citizen but his background is foreigner.
Herrmann said that from 2010 his state will keep this fact in mind while collecting the data of criminals.
Other than Bavaria, Hemberg is also working on same pattern.
Senator Christoph Ahlhaus of Interior ministry from CDU said:"" When the scientific research is conducted one can not draw results of his own rather they depend on the data which is calculated after research.
Ahlhaus presented an analysis report of provincial office of crime management prepared in 2006, according to which in the Bergdorf area of Hemberg the percentage of foreigners in the crimes committed there was calculated.
Results indicate that here foreigners
crime rate is less then the crimes committed in the whole province.
On the contrary during 2006 when youth crime rate in Berlin was observed revealed that the youth having the foreign background was .44
7 percent.
Other political parties of Germany like SPD, clean atmospherics party Greens, and leftist party Linkspartei are against the of gathering information whether the background of a German citizen is foreign while collecting the data about crimes.

Arabic sub-titles of this video message are also there.
on the side of the screen is the logo of Al-Qaida and the date written in the video is October 2008.

introducing himself as Abu Talha, this man however did not threaten to directly attack Germany.
the number of German troops amongst the Allied NATO forces in Afghanistan is around 3500.
last year the German parliament has approved a bill to send one thousand more troops to Afghanistan.
this is the first message to Germany from Al-Qaida.
having a critical eye on terrorism related issues, the famous expert Mikhail Luders says regarding this message: "the recent suicide attack on the German embassy in Kabul is a proof of the fact that we should take it seriously in any case.
for the past few years Al-Qaida has been issuing video messages on internet and there have been attacks as well after such messages.

In these regards, German Chancellor, Angela Merchel also expressed reliance on the new American President.
"I believe that the Joint Republic of Germany and the United States of America will be able to get together on the basis of strong relationships and partnership, to solve the problems facing us".
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that Obama seems a serious and open hearted person, and this is definitely something good.
As such, the previous American president's policies were subject to criticism.
However, his government is definitely credited with arousing China into playing a more constructive role on the international level, whereas, with regards to the new president, China has said that he will have to work for strong military ties between the countries.
Expert on Chinese politics, who is active in Bokhum, Germany, Gosuwe Hu, says:
From this viewpoint, I am certain that Obama and his economic team will, within the coming weeks and months, pressurize the Beijing government into pegging the Chinese currency to a stable and market representing exchange rate.
The previous American government also increased ties with India.
About where Obama might take those ties, Professor Christopher Raj, expert on American sciences in New Delhi, says that we are now closer to a strategic partnership, but Obama cannot make any change overnight.
In a message sent to Obama by Pope Benedict, he also stressed upon the need to create an environment of peace and mutual help in the world.

Tea: an effective cure for breast cancer
According to a new research, three cups of tea a day,
if taken, can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age, by more than a third.
In a research carried out by the Moffitt Cancer Institute, in the American state of Florida, it was revealed that the risk of occurrence of breast cancer tumors, in such women below the age of 50 years
who drink at least three cups of tea a day, is reduced by up to 37%.
It was also revealed in the research that there was no significant benefit, in these regards, in the woman aged above 50, who drank three or more cups of tea a day.
Experts believe that the reason for this is that tea has such ingredients in it, which are more effective against specific tumors which generally occur in women below the age of 50.
In Moffitt Cancer Center, in the city of Tampa, Florida state, a research was conducted on over 5000 women, who had undergone treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles with women who were safe from breast cancer.
The experts also found out that on a specific type of cancer called lobular cancer, the drinking of tea has shown clear effects, and has decreased its occurrence by 66 percent.
A tenth of every breast cancer patient suffers this type of cancer.
This type of cancer is more dangerous because it is deeper and is usually only known after it spreads quite a bit.
Experts say that regular tea consumption, at least three cups a day, can drastically reduce the occurrence of breast cancer in young women.
They say that making tea a regular beverage taken on a daily basis and included in ones daily activities causes the suitable defense required against cancer in the body.
In Britain, every year, approximately 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer.

why reduce exercise with the age?
new research
exercise at any age is good for health.
it energizes your heart, reduces the cholesterol level, helps in keeping the weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer or dementia.
unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.
experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.
Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.
She lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.
The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart.
In which the pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.
The experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood.
They learnt that as people grew old, there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.
Dr. Patricia says that as age increases, the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear, and this affects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garwin  Cain was also a part of this study.
He says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this. And this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.
If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart, they can achieve the benefits of excercise, despite the increase in age.
A detailed report of this has been published in the magazine of the American Medical Association.

May Allah bless the tongues of the world and may Barack become a blessing for the world.
Though it was not expected, still we shall see how this change  will work out in our favor with regards to Pak-American relations.
And what Barack Obama, who is the result of Martin Luther Kings dreams, gives to the world.
Obama's (whose name has Hussein also), oath as a President of America on one hand is historical while on the other hand is a hard test too
not only for him but for all those people who has supported him heartily.
This will also be a test for white people majority as it is not easy for them to accept heartily the presidency of black on them.
Here in Southern Asia specially Muslims who have developed expectation from him must remember that he has been elected as President of America and Obama must remember that President of America is Practically the president of the whole world.
A little while from then, a person whose real brothers were brought to America from their own countries, wearing the neckband of slavery,and whose blood and sweat watered the roots of the strongest country of the new era, today the a representative of that very same targeted lineage will be called the 44th President.
Many people have many expectations from this man.
It is necessary for those who admire him that they do not make unrealistic expectations about him.
If Obama is even successful in somewhat reducing the hate that is spread on lineage and religion based lines, it will be a victory for his admirers.
What effect will this change have on South Asia, and what considerable change can be expected in the American policy in this regards?
How will these changes affect Pakistani-American relations?
?
My Sir, whether it be Obama or someone else, the type of policies with regards to the whole world is decided by the multi-billionaire, influential, strong Jewish lobby.
As for Pakistan, with regards to the recent Mumbai blasts, the injurious actions taken by India, Israel and America has been seen by the whole world.
Even for a while, after Pakistan was formed, the managing of Swat was left to the Ruler of Swat, which had it's own army and law.
They surrendered their rule to the government of Pakistan according to a treaty.
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a step mother.
There has been no increase in the number of schools in Swat, since the rule of the Ruler of Swat was finished.
Nor was there any interest in the construction and development over there.
The number of girls receiving education in the present rule is many times less than their number in the previous rule.
Targeting of educational institutes is continued by local Talibans in NWFP Province of Pakistan.
Most schools are destroyed in Swat majority of those are of girls.
Not only this Taliban has announced a ban on girls education.
Thousands of students (boys and girls) are unable to get education.
What do you think Talibans wants to achieve by stopping women education.
Why the government has failed to stop these illegal actions?
In your opinion what government should do.
Question must be this that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
Because Swat people has understand the game that army is there to serve Taliban not to kill them otherwise how five schools can be destroyed in a single night during curfew, how people can be butchered and hanged in the square.
When government writ is unable to implement in Swat in these circumstances how the government will succeed in eliminating these illegal activities.
Now the question is when government has every thing like armed force, latest weapons, latest technology and spy system then why these Taliban can;t be controlled?
The only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught.
The essence is that these Taliban are paving the path for 'International Imperialism' by their bad deeds.
15 years ago, the war was on in Afghanistan.
ISI used to control the Taliban when there was the opposition from the Northern Alliance, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then, suddenly the situation changed and Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of Dollars from America, so the previous friend became an enemy.
Now the situation has changed but the war is still going on and those supporting them in Pakistan are still Russia, India and Iran.
Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.
For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play Holi with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings
The question is that, is war, armed resistance and terrorism the solution to problems?
If not, then what is the magic recipe that will bring out a solution to the problems?
This is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but rather it puts 'blessings' in them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development, that Nelson Mandela had used in South Africa.
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
From the Kashmiris taking part in the elections, it looks as if they have accepted this view point.
It is the third week of Israeli attacks on Gaza and the number of deaths have gone close to a thousand.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date, a ceasefire was not possible.
According to another report, since the start of attacks, on the 27th of December, 90,000 Palestinians have left their homes and moved towards safer locations.
Here, aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, and said that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victim of grave psychological and emotional difficulties.
What do you say?
What should happen?
how is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Taliban should be given a chance
basit, Peshawar
Please wakeup, if the Taliban start doing the real Jihad, then who will kill the innocent people.
Who will burn down the girls' schools?
who will do kidnapping for ransom or if ransom not paid then blame people of being American agents and hang them on the towers?
these Taliban have brought such damage to Islam that no nation or religion has ever brought.
Pushtun force
Kohat, Pakistan
If the whole Islamic world just threat Israel for launch of attack you will see that in how much pain father of Israel America will be in
and not only talks about real ceasefire rather ceasefire will be accomplished.
But what to do our Muslim leaders lack the courage greatly.
Some one ask Ahmadinejad to take the initiative because your bravery is very popular in BBC Forum.
The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights falls not only upon the Arabs, or the Muslims of the world, but rather it is the duty of all the nations in the world that they speak up against oppression.
This troubling incident is one of the worst misdeeds of Bush yet.
Similar to how, in Pakistan and India, on the 30th of June, that is before the close of the financial year, the government institutions are looted, in the same way, before the winding up of the American government, Israel was given the green signal to do whatever it wants.
On one hand, America says that it will try for a ceasefire.
On the other hand, the United Nations is passing resolution after resolution, but action-wise, neither have done anything. There is only one meaning of this, and that is that the even the United Nations is openly in favor of destroying the Muslims.
All Muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the United Nations, and should establish their own global organisation.
We have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations are seen, but the harm is only done to the Muslims.
What is the use of these vain efforts if BBC does not want to publish anything?
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically of Muslims, is spilled, the monster of unbiasedness gets onto BBC's back.
which considers itself the standard bearer of truth.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments
from Muslims
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, and the likes of you stay among Muslims, call yourselves Muslims and cause Muslims..
[syja786]
For a while, BBC forums have been making a certain point, sometimes while discussing suicide attacks and other times, terrorism in India.
The most used word in these anti-Islamic comments is extremism.
But, who is extremist, that you can easily figure out from the above comment.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal can not be fought with the sword?
Looking at the helpless people facing the Israel bombings, if the heart does not cry tears of blood what coes it do?
But the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that we try to use the name of Jihad to disfigure the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existece of Israel, then what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks.
The conduct of both sides is misanthropist.
The action of the United Nations and the United States seem to be supporting the Israeli wrongdoings.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
And we should think about giving the real terrorists an anti-terrorism Nobel prize for their painstaking efforts against terrorism, as after all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, would it be possible for terrorism to take place at such a large scale without the support of some big leader? And everyone knows who is controlling the strings.
In easy words, such gangsters are told to do whatever they want.
What a forceful act, hit on the head, and do not allow to cry.
The medicines for the injured, the shroud and compensation for  the dead are being given by the Arab rulers, and the question is,
Israeli attacks, what should happen?
The actual problem is that the leaders of all the Muslim countries, including the Saudi king are in a deep sleep. They neither have an army nor any protective plans. They think they can support and fulfill their responsibility.
They should take immediate action against Israel.
such as stopping the sale of petrol to Europe and America, but unfortunately..
Salams to all sisters and brothers.
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is similar to considering them defeated.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature, as the steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Israel and Hamas should enter a truce so that the death and destruction can come to an end.
Mohammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France
Absolutely correctly stated
Supposing that Hamas is 100% on the truth, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah. Even then, they should know that if a good deed is resulting in the destruction of an established house, it is no more a good deed.
Those who claim to love God, love the messenger and love their religion, loving mankind is a part of their faith.
As if it is the order of Allah to evacuate all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than the Muslims.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
No, not to kill them, but rather the order is to invite them to Islam.
But those people who plan against the religion, there is the order to perform Jihad against them.
To fight them until they stop their plans, but this does definitely not mean that you wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the end result of killing innocent children is destruction.
But I would like to tell my friends that yesterday the Israelis did not have any place for shelter, but today they have become so strong that they do not listen to anyone. This is because the Jews are one.
They do not have Shia, Sunni. They are all just Jews, and they have made everything for development.
On the other hand, what is the state of the 55 Islamic countries?
They are behind in every field, and now the situation is that they have become so helpless that the enemy is killing them and they are waiting to die.
The need is for all the Muslim countries to get togetherand prepare an action plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better action plan than this, to accept Israel and to learn modern science and developmental ways from it, and allow the world to live in peace and calm.
Muslims have a lot of land and resources.
The need is for proper utilisation.
First, the part that hurts the most is that there could not be unity between Hamas and Al-Fath.
Great leader like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were systematically killed to weaken the brave nation of the only region which is still fighting for Masjid Aqsa, and this was not possible as long as Yasin and Arafat were in the way.
The world is watching how Palestine is getting scattered, second by second, after the death of these two leaders.
And how the Jewish lobby is increasing its reach, second by second.
In 1974 a Pakistani Prime Minister was of such an International trust that first time in history he united all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance.
Today on his 81st birthday is it hard enough for the nation to promise for unity with each other
but by eliminating the differences between other Muslims will accomplish its (establishment of Islamic Common Wealth) incomplete mission.
This is a Jinn, which has entered Palestine for half a century.
That Jinn has many mouths.
Many a times, this Jinn calls itself bad names from one of its other mouths to divert the attention and reduce the pressure of the world from it.
It is another mouth of this Jinn whichis eating people in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This Jinn fears Islam the most, as it knows that whenever it is removed, only Islam, Mulsims and the complete religion of Islam being followed practically, in its followers can remove it, as history proves that Islam has brought many Abu Jahls to the path.
The series of bombings of Gaza by Israeli war planes and missile strikes has been going on since the 27th of December.
More than three hundred Israeli citizens have died so far in these attacks.
Now, after the air strikes, Israeli tanks have reached the Gaza border, completely prepared to launch a land offensive.
The Security Council of the United Nations, through an agreed upon resolution passed in an emergency meeting, have demanded that Israeli and Palestinian authorities stop extremist activities immediately.
However, Israeli officials claim that they will continue their action in Gaza until they are convinced that Israel will be safe from rocket attacks.
In your opinion, is the statement by Israel, that this is an Israeli struggle for safety, acceptable?
In this situation, is the global brotherhood doing its job?
Can this inhumane action have a direct relation with the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can there be any expectation of improvement in the Middle East situation, after newly elected president Barack Obama takes office?

Palestine is a holy land for the Muslims, all over the world, and protecting it is a necessary duty for us.
We should also remember that it was our first Qiblah.
And Israel, America and India have to disappear one day, as they are made only to be destroyed, and Allah will definitely destroy the disbelievers. Sajid Sadiq, Lahore.
"When has the night of loneliness been spent shedding tears,
When has a calamity been averted only by supplication" (Nawab Zadah Nasrullah Khan)
Such reviews are anxiously telecasted by BBC.
After all the image and prestige of neutralism has to be kept.
Though BBC news are often true but the real thing is the delivery.
What to highlight and which news is given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
Now In this regard our Pakistani print and electronic media, specially few Urdu newspapers and columnists etc. are not behind in the trade who in the coverage or writing of increasing terrorism exaggerate to hell.
He said that the United Nations which speaks of human rights and peace, but though the Muslims ar being oppressed greatly, you hear them say that until Hamas does not stop it's attacks, this unfair policy will continue.
Why is so much oppression being done on the Muslims? If people such as America stop supporting these Jews, then Allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support, and then see what kind of life they get.
The famous just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.
In the words of a poet
Oppression is oppression, that the more it's done the more it is erased.
Blood is blood, that the more it falls, the more it gathers.
Now who can tell who did terrorism?
Is all this not included in terrorism? Why does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocent not red?
And why is there no one to send a mourning message from anywhere?
I watched the progress of the Mumbai incident, as if my own house was on fire. The sorrow of humans can not be watched, and who can not see this sorrow? If only Muslims would think a bit, together.
How can words derogate the bodies strewn on the streets, helpless innocent faced people, injured and soaked in blood?
I feel like crying about the helplessness of Muslims, that on one side, people are dying in India, and the whole world is climbing onto Pakistan, without any proof and saying, take action or else we will.
And on the other side, Israel is ruthlessly killing Muslims and the whole world is silent. This is unbearable.
There is delay, but no darkness, with God. That too, when this darkness comes to pass.
Danger to Israel, with America present, is a joke.
As for elections, there is no doubt, to gain public support, such actions will have to be taken for the sake of power, especially in a state like Israel. As for Barack Obama, history is witness that no American ruler has been able to go against the American policy and nor will they go. Whether the ruler is white or black, he is still a ruler.
It appears from the conversation of forum that everyone is grieved over Benazir death but as politician her mistakes are not forgotten.
It is debatable that Benazir died for democracy or for power.
If she sacrificed for democracy then why she left democracy in the dictatorship of Musharraf for 10 years till she got a deal and American clearance?
Benazir did not return Pakistan when dictatorship affected people needed her she returned Pakistan when she has the assurances of free from cases and of power.
when each and every historic personality is being accused, there is no one to say any thing over this.
Sana Khan
few things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done of them.
another reader.
Sir/Sir probably you should not only study Pakistan's history but that of 4 friend and 7 other countries, may be you would agree with Psycho's point of view.
Tariq Ayaz
'those who don't have a good nature can't be corrected through training'
living green in the water made the reflection of the wheat plant look like a cypress.
Britain never let them unite and established the Hindu-Muslim conflict which was later on brought up by Sir Syed.
psycho
how brutal is our nation, not only we are blind while writing odes on ourselves and our parties but now we are picking, accusing and criticizing every historical scholar and no body is there to say any thing over this.
enough of development that we have made.
Sana Khan
few things are ignored just by thinking that nothing can be done of them. Just like a donkey can not become a scholar by just loading books over it.
although after the Mumbai attacks, there has been a setback in the dialog between Pakistan and India, however Pakistan and India should continue these dialogs.
if we talk of war then it will bring loss of humans from both sides.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu but on the other hand when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader; point to be noted.
First of all Mary Christmas to Mr. Bhana and to all the Christian brothers of the forum.
greeting to all friends of the Forum: Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, sister Sana, sister Shahida and Mr. Akram.
We do not want the flames of war, we want the flowers of peace.
War is in itself, a problem.
What problems can war solve?
It will give fire and blood today.
It will give hunger and need tomorrow.
Therefore, O intelligent people,
If war keeps getting postponed, it's better.
In your and our porch,
If the candle keeps burning, it's better.
Indo-American relations have now gotten quite deep, and India knows with certainty, that America will openly betray Pakistan, when the time comes.
This is that old history of America.
Because in the case of an Indian attack, America's goals will also be fulfilled and the expenses will be India's.
Pakistan should clearly announce that it will not start, but if injury is caused, there will be no talks of peace or truce, and the war will not stop until India is completely destroyed or captured, even if it involves our destroying ourselves.
This is Islamic history.
Before this resolution Pakistani people and army has delivered their message.
Indian struggle for having unusual diplomatic and military benefits in compensation of Mumbai attacks are proving her cunning party then affected. Therefore the world has reduced its pressure on Pakistan contrasting to its initial hard reaction.
UN has expressed faith on Pakistani efforts ignoring the unnecessary lamentation of India and Interpol's appreciation of Pakistani efforts is the 'side effect' of unwanted Indian diplomacy.
There is no two opinions about this being a very beastly action.
But the question is, that when thousands of Taliban were attacking Pir Samiullah's town, where was the Pakistani Army, and what were they doing?
Should the army not be taken into account, as to what they did there for one year?
Every day, how many Taliban die due to the firing of the thousands of mortar and canon shells they fire?
I appeal to the ICI that they stop their guardianship of the Taliban, for Gods sake, and let us live peacefully in paradise like Swat.
And they stop this fixed operation.
The day is not far when in UN resolution of Army intrusion in Pakistan will be approved just like the one against Jamat Aldawa.
Riaz Ahmed Farooqi
First our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in UN,
and suppose if this resolution took time to approve then considering the example of America any country will launch the attack at her own.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
As the bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They command even after they die.
But there is an international game being played over here. Here, they are ruling by scaring the public about beastliness and terror.
So that it would be permissible for them, saying that if we are not there, beasts and wild people will come and capture the government.
Such actions of the so called Islam lovers, in the name of religion is extremely disagreeable.
The supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of America, but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions, give it the name of tribal traditions, and clearly avoid it.
Any person with a heart can never accept these beastly actions, which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of Islam.
I think the people of our army have joint these people.
This is because, when these people move around, at least some time will be taken. To catch them will only take so much time. But, forget about getting to that spot, even if they were there, they escape from there.
Are these people so brave that they take 50 or 70 people hostage and our army watches like an audience, with hand on hand.
They are also servants of Allah and so is the army.
It is clear that something is sinister.
Malaiyat. In the dictator of the age, Ziya-ul-Haqq's dictatorship, instead of presenting the Noble and Merciful characters of God, an atmosphere of religio-phobia was created by the use of many types of narrations of punishments and incidents apart from the incident of the body hanging. Even the literature and books like 'what will happen when we die?' created fear and terror.
And these people are only using this fear as a tool or a weapon to gain worldly pleasures and honor.
preachers!
As you have preached against the fire of Hell
that you have yourself become the face of fear.
It is surprising when it is said that this can not be a work of a Muslim
We are either unaware of our own history, or we ignore it for some reason.
Upon the death of the Prophet, upon refusing to pledge alliegance, who burnt the door of the daughter of the Messenger and pulled her husband out with a rope around his neck?
Had they come from somewhere outside?
was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
without accepting reality neither the motives can be diminished nor correction can be made.
O' BBC please stop this dual-headed policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
please show some modesty, a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office.
For the success of Operation Sherdil and across the border the success of Operation Lion Heart depends on the favor of people.
It is carried out by American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahib is a victim of conspiracy.
In this forum all reviews will be against Taliban, Agencies have been successfully indulged in Taliban and are applying the policies which might change public opinion.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public. They even report something like this 'Bombing on Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000, in Swat went there to do.
That the bodies of the Taliban who helps the army is left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake stop this drama.
These Talibans have tarnished the Muslim image.
If in the whole world true Muslims don't call these terrorists as Muslims then how come these elements are able to live in the lands of true Muslims.
Those who become shameless, can't do hard labor they pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
There is no allowance of this in any religion or family traditions.
Including BBC all the media present their views in different styles on Taliban or the tribal people.
But no one is aware of the ground realities or what the truth is. It is us the tribal people who know what rally is the matter.
In short, its a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a talib or a tribal. Who made these institutions? Warmongers who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions.
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute the leader of MQM, Althaf Husain, and the leaderships of ANP and PPP, as they have spoken against this cancer, i.e. the Taliban.
This cancer was given birth to by Zia-ul-Haqq. He has gone, but he has destroyed Pakistan as he went.
But I have hope that the present government will eradicate this cancer.
After Mumbai attacks India said that few extremist groups are involved in these attacks.
Pakistan denied these blames and said that she will fully cooperate in the investigation.
India said that she has provided Pakistan a list of 20 extremists, who are wanted to India.
Noe Pakistan said that leader of Jaish e Muhammad Maulana Masud Azhar present in this list is not detained and Government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before this President Asif Ali Zardari has denied the impression that Western Secret Agencies and Indian Government have provided Pakistan the proves of Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said about Ajmal Qasab that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
During this Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that Indian relation with her can't get better till the time her soil is used for terrorism.
And in recent updates Indian Cricket team has canceled its tour of Pakistan.
Should these political incidents affect sports?
How do you see the future of Pakistan and India relations?
Neither America nor India will break Pakistan.
Pakistan will break itself.
With so much regionalism, factionism and infiltration, what else can you expect?
Time has proved that Jinnah did not do good to the Indian Muslims.
Yasmin, Chicago
Madam, if work was continued in Jinnah's manner, neither would the tumors of regionalism, factionism and infiltration have spread in Pakistan, nor would the Indian Muslims been treated in this way.
but it's our fault that we could not bring up a leader like his stature.
if we can not care for our heroes, then
this region has great capabilities.
god knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
in both countries the enemies to peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv sena, RSS have been raised.
and the evil powers don't want this region to progress therefore these countries are controlled like puppets.
can you imagine what status will this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world.
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
may Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
but Sir, open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
moreover, the internal affairs don't seem to be good, as you can see the circumstances in NWFP, Balochistan and in Karachi in Sindh.
in this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
O Allah bestow your mercy upon us.
Account to my understanding, a final war is inevitable.
this is enough of it.
now it should be do or die.
this problem can not be solved through these acts of insincere dialogues.
and not through small scale terrorism in each other's country.
after all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
and if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be finished.
But our military leadership does not seem to be sincere in these regards. On the one hand, America and Europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism, and on the other hand we secretly help the Taiban.
We should think and fix our direction and choose only one way. Thanks.
There is no doubt that majority of the workers of Jama'athud Da'wah are the previous members of Lashkar-e-Taiba who joint the group called Jama'athud Da'wah Pakistan, after Lashkar-e-Taiba was rendered inexistent.
However, after that, the members gave preference to social work, and now even Jama'athud Da'wah was rendered inexistent by the United Nations, due to the pressure applied by India and the crackdown being enforced by the Pakistani government.
I believe that if Jihadi groups leave religious fundamentalism and take up social efforts, that would be better.
The present terrorist groups that bring up criminals in the name of Jihad, and the elders of these Mullas, are the same people who used to call 'Pakistan' 'Palidistan', and who knows what else.
Now they are not leaving any stone unturned in destroying Pakistan.
Actually, these are not even fit to be called human beings, let alone 'Muslims'.
Without cleaning Pakistan of these mischief mongers, the national security will remain at risk.
Can we still think about whether or not to put a ban on these mischief mongers?
There is no place on earth for extremist Mullahs whose only work is to cause killings.
Heart is breaking into pieces on this news.
What world is this where it is hard to survive for the one who names an important part of Allah's religion Islam.
Non Muslims can kill Muslim, but if Muslim even tries to take revenge then along with the whole non Muslim world our hypocrite leaders also treat the ones sincere with true and sincere religion like they are treating our great leader Hafiz Saeed now a days.
As a penalty of Mumbai attacks India.
Pakistan relations are affected, and the recent improvement of relations between two countries is enormously shocked.
India has been continually blaming active armed and unarmed groups in Pakistan
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the action against these groups.
Whereas Indian Security agencies has directly blamed Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks
, in this regard Jamat Adawa has also been nominated.
It is not the first time that because of any terrorist attack the relation of these two countries are worsen.
In December 2000 after the attacks on Indian Parliament both countries were at the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashkr e Taiba was banned and was included in terrorists list.
Now Jamat Adawa, to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of Lashkr e Taiba, is demanded to be banned.
What do you think, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against active extremist groups on her soil?
Can by banning Jamat Adawa present India,
Pakistan crisis will vanish and to what extent it is vital to ban armed groups for establishing forever peace between the two countries.
The Security Council of the United Nations has passed the ban on Jama'athud Da'wah. However, what proof did the Security Council have based on which it showed such urgency.
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful state.
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salute, sir, salute happily, but get your work done on your own.
Do not do it under the pressure from America.
If India is in difficulty, let them prove it, no?
Why does it not give?
And why do they accuse us with everything?
There are fundamentalist groups and organisations, even in India. Why does no one put any restrictions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the whole world?
What is it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What is it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the first Islamic Nuclear State. Why, is what the fight is about.
Pakistan is now in it's last stages.
Kamran Hassan: Abu Dhabi
Your words touch the heart, and the situation seems so.
Now in American publications, the new map of Pakistan is being printed, and all these restrictions are now apparent in the series of events.
The Americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over Pakistan.
In this situation, if we do not stand together and show our unity, then remember, if Bangladesh can be made, then anything can happen.
Terrorist attacks should be condemned to the maximum, whether they are on the Mumbai Hotel or the Marriot Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine.
Similarly, terrorists should be hunted down irrespective of their nationality and whether they are Pakistani, Indian, American or Israeli.
Now the question is that every day terrorist attacks take place in Pakistan, hundreds of people die but the Pakistani officials along with the rest of the world stay silent.
Wasn’t the attack on the Marriot Hotel an act of terrorism?
Then why?
Appreciation for Interior Advisor Rehman Malik, Masha Allah he has become very brave!
According to BBC on one hand (a committee of) Security Council of UN has banned Jamat Aldawa, on the other hand Mr. Malik says we didn't impose the ban and if it is to be done will be after through research.
Not this, according to BBC Mr.Malik has strongly denied the impression that arrest of terrorists are taking place because of 'someone's instructions'
Highly appreciated!
Whether the ability is there or not, or whether it should be said that it is not needed.
We, i.e. Pakistan, are fighting somebody else's war
And why are there our own interest which we are trying so hard to save?
No one has the right to interfere in any country's affairs.
This does not seem to be the era of new populations.
If people expect justice, or demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan, which I think is not acceptable by those calling for unity.
As such, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
And this causes more opposing feelings.
If they trust America and the United republics, then let them leave the style of new populations, and let them work on those lines, upholding the sovereignty of the state.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
Security forces raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
Pressure is being increased on Pakistan for taking rapid action against extremist organizations after Mumbai attacks.
India blames Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Secretary Condolisa Rice asked Pakistani leadership to take practical measures for instant and transparent action against the responsible s of Mumbai attacks.
She says that no doubt the extremists responsible for Mumbai attacks used Pakistani soil.
During this Peshawar Government says that unknown armed persons has set another truck stand for supply of goods to Allied Forces deployed in Afghanistan on fire, due to which more then fifty vehicles are destroyed.
It is the second attack on Neto and American supplies during 48 hours in Peshawar.
During this Pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from Karachi to Tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action.
It is revealed that during the reign of General Zia ul Huq because of the invasion of the ex USSR in Afghanistan and its resistance started by the American and Saudi funding resulted in the birth of armed groups of which Pakistan unable to terminated could not get back herself to the era before 1980s.
The question is does Pakistan want to do it?
Is Pakistan capable of doing this?
What do you think?

I have only one question for the standard bearers of the world.
If you kill their children, will they come to garland you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill innocent public, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in negative, then you really need to fix your viewpoint.
Peoples were armed at that time it was feared that after Afghanistan, Russia will attack Pakistan so people were armed.
Now when there is the danger of American attack via Afghanistan of which current American President clearly expressed in his presidential campaign then why should we disarm these people?
Only for this that after defeating Pakistani Army America or India may not face any public resistance?
Yes, if any of them is involved in sabotage activities then only Pakistan should take action against him.
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
And another question is that were these terrorists not supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As for as Lashkr e Taiba is concerned ongoing terrorism is not linked to it.
It must be recalled that Hafiz Saeed was the first 'Militant Leader' who declared activities of Taliban 'revolt'.
I am quite sure that Taliban agitation is a vital part of American plans so every person or organization must be eliminated who challenges Taliban in any aspect.
Despite the cooperation of the whole nation action against Lashkr due to the pressure of India indicates the nervousness and flatterness of Zardari and Co.
To terminate the expedition started by the American and Saudi funding, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society.
Also protest them that by what ethics American and Saudis are spreaded dangerous arms and so called Jihadi but in fact the virus of  loathsome literature and culture, due to which human butcher houses established in our country.
After facing the risk of attack from India, the Pakistani Army's announcement that it would remove forces from the Afghan border and post them at the Indian border, and the announcement of the Taliban that it would handle the Afghan border, caused America to stumble, and pressurize India not to attack Pakistan.
This showed the strength of America in the region.
Though India did not warn that they would attack, and nor do they have that much courage.
The Taliban attacked and finished most of the remaining American supplies.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and tha Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi Business Financial Center of Pakistan is Dubai of underdeveloped areas.
Hundreds of thousand never return empty pocket from here, but since the grip of law has weekend in Western Frontier areas all eyes are on Karachi.
Now they are about to kidnap this city.
First time Pathans are named Pakhtoon, residents of a city are involved in fighting like strangers, although need of the time is unity.
One solution to this problem is that either the Urdu speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun speaking people learn Urdu, or better yet, both learn English.
You might think that this is a funny proposal, but does the cause of the conflict not seem funny?
That the cause of extremism be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, I actually shared this proposal many times in my childhood with my friends, which included people from all religious and linguistic groups, but these people used to laugh at me.
At that time, the religious and linguistic hate, which was not as lively and strong as they are today, were still developing within.
Can't understand what and why it is happening?
Are these the indicators of Dooms day.
By what reason innocents are dieing?
Every one knows the causes those who want to destroy Pakistan are involved and those who commit all this have no religion or country.
Either Karachi or Mumbai it is an inside job.
Every upcoming government gets herself involved in changing the names of places, like now a days airport, roads, buildings all Benazir.
Is this the meaning of Benazir which is happening in Karachi and to the peoples of Pakistan?
At the height of the Mumbai attacks, the fact that the efforts to cause mischief on linguistic and racial lines in Karachi failed is proof that those politicians working on racial parole have resigned from their jobs.
The taking of the lives of innocent Pushtu speaking labourers and the Indian warnings have awakened the sleeping Pakistani feelings from Karachi to Khyber.
The identical country loving reaction of all the political, religious, linguistic and national parties has not only taught India the manners of diplomacy but it has also given the American policy makers a chance to think again.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the worse situation in Karachi and administration is not neutral.
Administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately
, police and rangers don't take action because of political parties pressure.
To unite is only expressed in speeches, political parties should have to quit their interests and work for common people.
Till the end administration is under political pressure such incidents will increase, Allah bless Pakistan.
I believe these people are the biggest terrorists.
And there are definitely some foreign forces at work here, but I do not know whose?
And the sad thing is that if such a situation was prevalent in any border town, the government would take care of that place, but as this is far from the border, the government looks helpless.
The government should set up an operation here, and save a big and important town from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth due to fear, and as for the local media, it is even thinner.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that either the Urdu speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun speaking people learn Urdu or even better, both learn English.
Definitely, you might think this is a funny proposal, but do you not think the reason for the clashes is funny?
that the cause of extremism be language?
They spilled blood in Karachi and the story that each citizen was fearing for a long time was finally written.
No one left any stone unturned, and the reports that surfaced in the media was 50% of what actually happened here in four days.
I stayed up the last three nights and I am still afraid.
The people who killed the cobblers and peanut sellers who evacuated the hotel
The people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of Allah's punishment which can catch them anytime.
What do you think are the reasons for this sudden violence?
(BBC)
Keeping the heart rendering Mumbai attacks in view and diving to search for a cause for the violence in Karachi is not at all needed, rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in 'blood'.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control.
Liaqat Ali Khan and many devotees also belonged to there,for correcting the misunderstanding of Mr. Psycho I am quoting a verse
We also will follow our ancestors
sacrificed for her existence and will sacrifice to save her.
Faizan Taufiq Siddiqui
It is very sad, the whole country is at stake while we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui for your kind information if Wikipedia.
org is searched for Liaqat Ali Khan, you will know that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family of an area of Punjab Karnal.
Due to his services for Muhajirs, they consider him their leader.
Every action has a reaction.
One can bear ones self, but..
I'jaz A'wan
Sir, before you get a large number of people with proposals, I shall tell you that the open signs of this mischief is also found on the walls of Karachi, in the form of posters and wall chalking.
We have been bearing both types of mischief.
Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan. They did not have to face any reaction.
Contrary to that, they are pecking at the chest of Pakistan.
Only Muslim League (N) was left, she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to Peoples Party.
Before this MQM and Muslim League (Q) has already submitted the draft of 18th amendment in assembly and senate.
Till now it appears that 18th amendment was a political move and none of the party is sincere in its approval.
This is why nobody has raised voice in the favor of this amendment in senate or assembly and neither forced the House to approve the amendment.
It seems that by submitted the draft of 18th amendment these parties has beaten around the bushes means they can claim that we had submitted the amendment but the ruling party's speaker did not proceed.
MQM an ally of government, Muslim League (N) secret friend and Muslim League (Q) has approved the 17th amendment, then how is it possible that they are sincere in removing 17th amendment.
It is like painting red to be counted amongst martyred.
Peoples Party is not what so ever in a hurry to remove 17th amendment.
Nobody can think of cutting his own hands.
As long Zardari is President 17th amendment will be there.
It was majority's opinion in our one survey and a fact too.
If 17th amendment ought to be removed then Zardari wont become president.
Now he is more powerful then President Pervez as along with the President he is the Chairman of Peoples Party.
Till he is president 17th amendment is there.
For removing 17th amendment political parties has to depart President Zardari from President house first.
Neither MQM wants it nor the other parties.
Most elders of our family belonged to labor class.
And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.
To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.
Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.
From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.
But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.
We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.
It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God
This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.
It was not even 30 minutes for us working that our younger son said “Dad it feels like I am not born for this job.
We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.
Son started saying that I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work .
Three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home.
What it means is that when a man decides the destination no matter what were the motives behind this no one can stop him from getting it.
But if you don’t even know what you have to do then God be with you.
It is said that don't accuse the dead, but can't help it as we see only evils in her on the first anniversary of Benazir.
On one side Benazir crushed independence movement of Sikhs by handing over the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India for her own sake and on the other hand provided India an opportunity to fully concentrate in Kashmir after crushing the movement in Punjab.
The greed of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years.
During her exile Benazir continued to give negative statements on Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir made a deal with Pervez Musharraf while betraying the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif.
During her reign Benazir provided her husband the opportunity of making money and because of this he popularized as Mr. 10 percent.
Benazir brother was killed during her reign whose assassins are still safe.
Though a woman still Benazir avoided to fight for the rights of women.
Just like Benazir politicized her father's dead body similarly his widower husband politicizing her dead body.
Benazir reigned twice but not only she failed to punish her father's political murder but could not file a case against them.
It is 37 years since East Pakistan was separated from us, and look at the height of insensitivity on the part of the public and the rulers, that no one ever mourned or expressed sorrow over their mistakes.
We should have been observing 16th December as a day of reflection, and made plans to prevent the re occurrence of such incidents.
We should have been sending greetings to the people of Bangladesh on this day and been trying to bring them closer to ourselves.
The ruler should have opened the Jamudur Rahman commission file and pondered over the causes of separation of West Pakistan, mentioned therein.
He would plan on bringing back the people of Bihar who were stuck in Bangladesh and he would send them gifts to keep their spirits up.
We have become so insensitive that if someone dies in our neighborhood, we are not even aware of it.
We do not care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
A huge calamity can pass by, but the next day we are lost in our day-to-day routine of life.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again, like East and West Germany became one.
We can become one again, if we sacrifice a little for each other and leave our selfishness behind us.
But this wish does not look like it will be fulfilled in the near future.
Today when it was told in the news that Governor of American State Illinois has been arrested for charges of corruption
and to remove him from governorship provincial Congress is preparing for his rapid accountability, our American friend who has a keen interest in Pakistani affairs exaggeratedly said to me 'see this is democracy'.
No one is beyond the law in America.
and here is your country Pakistan whose president was dropped of the corruption charges before sworn in.
My sense of humor rouse and I said what's strange if a governor has been arrested in America, in our Pakistan prime minister was arrested overnight and once was hanged and second time was exiled.
Tell me, has it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan the country law breaker has been departed from President House with guard of honor, tell me has it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan Chief Justice has been dismissed as despite of public support he is not reinstated yet, has this ever happened in America?
In Pakistan fake degree holder has become the Health Minister, did this happen in America?
By hearing this American laughed like mads and also accepted his defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded on all four sides by Americans.
It seems from his smile that
he thinks that America is with his government. He is forgetting that one year ago, they were with Pervez Musharraf.
This picture was passed on, as if it was of some family.
Previously, such a photo was never printed in newspapers before, i.e. one president with three American agents.
It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.
It is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.
If it was a smart ruler, at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo, and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting.
If the rules of democracy are implemented on this photo, President Zardari is in minority.
According to democracy, the majority are the rulers of the country, and the photo is speaking for itself who that is?
Paradise-like Swat is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
According to the government tactic so far, along with force, discussions have been going on.
But the use of force is not giving any benefit other than increasing the force of the Taliban and increasing the public favor for them.
It is required that the government finish the causes of this problem, rather than use force.
By finishing the causes, Fazlullah and the Taliban will be finished themselves.
The proposed Shariah bill of the ANP government will become a moderate solution to the problems in Swat.
But alongside the establishment of the Shariah, the government will also have to take care of economic problems.
From General Musharraf's initial few steps, it looked as if the nation would be freed of useless politicians, but the love for power changed all his plans.
Whatever expectations were, after joining the 'war of terror', he began to consider himself irremovable.
And whatever steps were expected were no more.
Just as Bush's rule began to close, he started to worry about the end of his own rule, and he struck a deal with thieves in the dark.
Even then, General Musharraf could have commanded the army, but the present government does not even know what is happening.
Whether in Bajod or Swat, the army cannot control terror, and instead they bomb the 'enemy', i.e. the public. Apart from loss of life and money, if they are making the 'enemy' psychologically ill, then we are the enemies, aren't we?
In Swat, the strongly affected part of Sarhad state, despite the continuity of military action for over one year, the situation is still going from bad to worse.
On one side, the government is only reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly. On the other side, the Taliban's illegal radio FM channel is having much more influence in the region.
On the third side, the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region.
During the action of the security forces, there were claims of destroying the fundamentalists by the bombing of gun ship helicopters and cannon houses, but despite these destructions, the Taliban only became more powerful, and according to an estimation, their control over Swat increased that much percent more.
As a result, on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat, and on the other hand the Taliban is stronger.
Who is stuck in  between? The poor civilians.
It is said in Swat, that someone asked what kind of people are the Taliban were, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of Allah and the religion'.
Then he asked how the army was, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country'.
He then asked who the enemies of the religion and the country were, so he got the answer, 'We civilians'.
I am wondering how the Pakistani Army will fight the Indian Army, when they couldn't control a small faction of the Taliban.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
But still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
After the girls schools, now boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfews are called so that the Taliban can move around easily.
During curfew tonight, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
The question arises as to how they got there despite the curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone explain to the army to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the Army can defeat any enemy.
He says, maximum bloodshed has been done on the base of religion, you tell me in the absence of any religion wont bloodshed occur?
Punjabi, Pathan. white and black, Mehsud and other tribes, are all these created by religion?
Not at all, sir, religion preaches us that there is no white, black, Punjabi or Muhajir, if there is no religion then half of the world would have been destroyed by the war of black and white and remaining half by the war of cast.
Actually religion nourishes human morally and restricts him that he is not here at his own rather is sent by The Creator of Universe and he has to live by God's rules.
As a Muslim I believe that Islam is true religion and a complete code of life.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France, for two years, I also felt the same way.
I do not know why people only expect us to call.
A resolution about Iraq, passed in a few hours, to send a 'peace' force to Darfur is not at all a problem.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where there is a matter of death, we are still holding meetings about that.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
Is the wait really going on for it to finish?
So that some oppressed person would not even be able to think about using some mass destruction weapon like ill will to obtain their right?
When a father is running around holding the corpse of his son, even then a small wave of sorrow does not arise from any part of your heart.
If not, you have no right to be called a human.
Rather you are a black spot on the name of humanity.
OK, this was proved that this area was also the home of the Israelis for thousands of years.
Ideally, these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection, but since their strings are in the hands of the western and Arab countries, therefore peace is not possible without their will.
Rather, now even Iran wants to fight a proxy war from here.
Even if Israeli action has stopped for a while, it will start again after some incident.
The interests of BBC homeland are affiliated to America and Israel and this is why under the wrapper of 'broadmindedness' it has produced a series of blogs consisted of 'Jewish favor' and is conducting one sided and blind 'propaganda'.
BBC is only carrying the 'formality' and its objective is to have sympathies!
It is requested to Mr. Moderator that he must publish this review so that it may be proved BBC has element of realism to some extent.
Thanks.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How could I not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time, including Derah Gahzi Khan, summer showers are taking place throughout the country.
Presented is a poem according to the season. Enjoy the rain along with this poem.
These rains are also from you
which when fell brings spring.
When it stops there is no movement
sometimes it came just like that, without a reason.
Sometimes it spread day and night.
sometimes loudly, sometimes silently.
These rains are also from you
in some remembrance some night
on some suppressed ashes
Sometimes it was such, that the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burnt itself.
Sometimes each drop seems sorrowful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What is it to them, whether the country lasts or not.
Whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them.
For one, our media is also corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government, and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday noon strange thing happened.
The whole police was running here and there but was least bothered about illegal parking.
Not this, NYPD traffic was not in the mood of noticing illegally parked vehicles.
What happened was, an airplane of US Air crash landed in the Hudson River.
Till now the only information pulled out was, ""the terrorists"" were of goose breed.
Yesterday it might be the historic cold in New york.
The temperature does not fall to this extent.
My jaw start to ache because of half an hour outside walk.
Just imagine what would have happened with those who jumped of the plane into the river.
A matter of relief as all the people were safe.
The dark side is that the Company's plane crashed in this financial crises.
While watching all this I went to New Jersey by West Side Highway. I Noticed that South Bound is blocked, still what I did?
Yes, I was jammed in it on my way back.
Thanks God,during my an hour trip the road was bit cleared as I get an exit from 56 street.
Otherwise I did not avail the first two exit due to the long lanes of vehicles.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.

Shaguftah: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I have slaughtered two chickens and how they are slaughtered, Jahanzeb has already mentioned.
Apart from this, there is no other way.

what happened on the forum?

Sir please use Fire Fox.
the snow will vanish.
we unnecessarily kept thinking of these Taliban of Swat as indelicate but who were only unhappy over women's education.
they kept expressing their grief by demolishing a women's school and college somewhere every day.
but just like other ideas, this idea did not also come true, according to this report by CNN, today on the sacred day of Monday this Taliban gang of Swat have blasted a boy's school.
Swat, The Taliban has destroyed a boys school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Amen, then Amen.
Masha Allah, up till now, 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom of fixing marriages before birth among Muslims, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See a picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
just a while before this, the wedding of a dog with a girl took place.
look at that groom.
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
Today is the age of computer and computer's interference is growing in every aspect of life.
Lots of people have many reservations about this growing interference of computer like in financial issues.
As you have facilities for using credit cards but by this law enforcement agencies has also firmer grip on your private life.
That just by tracking the record of your credit card you can be exposed.
And in future when use of currency will be minimal its utility will increase.
Similarly in crimes world there is no need to rob the bank, information of credit card are hacked.
Similarly friendship has become computerized
, social networking websites like Orcet, Facebook and MySpace are ranked first in popularity.
But don't you feel that the more closer we are getting of these sites mentally, practically moving further away from people.
Similarly there is the website of match making, where by knowing your choice you are provided with a list of people according to your likings.
Can you spend life with your own cologne (of course not physical)?
I can't do it, that is why a life partner is known as better half.
That he/she may cover my deficiencies.
Perhaps I have got a small share of sense.
I used to believe everything someone elder says.
In the same way, I thought that my father knew the answer to every question on earth.
I used to get laughed at a lot for this.
But only that seems true which can be possible.
It is very troubling, that what is the need to tell lies.
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
That is why I try to lie as less as possible.
that I do not falsely please others, that too with the name of Allah.
And that I say Insha Allah (If God Wills) only when I am asking Allah to complete the work.
As for the intentions, only Allah knows best.
This is a despicable matter that arose due to distance from religion.
According to both our religion and Pakistani law, young children should stay with their mothers.
Their expenses are to be borne by the father, and the father can meet his children.
Then when the child becomes of age, he or she can stay with whomever they will.
You rightly mentioned that the actual problem is that of the relatives who mislead.
Possessiveness is present in all our actions.
It is this very factor in effect over here, that there will be new shareholders in the father's property born, and they will go against him. Otherwise his fathers action is commendable.
These restrictions have caused social evils, even in our marriages.
The concept of the marriage of a divorced woman or a widow has become obscure.
It is these wasteful ideologies and baseless traditions that have made the family structure a mess.
In our society, if the wife of a 50-55 year old man or the husband of such a wife passes away, why are they not looked at in a nice manner?
Near us, there is a Pakistani uncle, whose wife passed away 10-12 years ago. Now, after marrying off all his children, he has married a widow, so even his children have gone against him.
I believe this is his legitimate right. What do you say?
What type of mentality is the 'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place', kind of mentality?
I believe that this persons children should have thought what is wrong if he married a widow, after he married off all his children?
Thereby, this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
As the children would definitely have gotten busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow if their wives refuse to look after them, when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is a curse in our society in which we are sunk since last 40 to 50 years.
Even a wife is agreed on the unethical activities of her husband but does not allow her for second marriage.
If she had the power She wont allow him of this even after her death.
Along with husband spoils her afterlife too and causes an increase in corruption in society.
Chanting Islam, Islam does not mean anything. In reality, we like only our culture and traditions.
For instance keeping girls  from gaining education and fearing marrying the girl of ones choice.
As for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house, so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax, (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt).
In IndopPak we embraced Islam centuries ago but can't get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then Islam.
Second marriage of man as ridiculous, divorce as stigma, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as disgrace and man's marriage with an elder woman as the result of her cunningness is all because of such thinking.
Moreover to copy the western nations we declare veil and worship backward.
It was easy to embrace Islam to get rid of such thinking is very difficult.
Allah bless us all the courage for it.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never that difficult.
Centuries passed in writing this little.
Consider it enough.
Allah Hafiz.
Ameer Taimur in his book "I am Taimur" writes I found the secret in my living time that if the commander of any army is present on the front line then that army will never be defeated.
But here the things are altogether different.
They say the population is by default for getting killed for us.
If anyone dies from the population, it is considered Murder.
AsSalaamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu (greeting)
Today, as I was returning to my shop, after Isha prayer, when a man sitting in a car at the circle raised his hand and diverted my attention towards him.
I thought this man might have lost his way, or he might want to ask something, so I stopped, and his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked whether I could understand Arabic well or not. I said no problem, tell me what you want.
He started to say that I have come from Riyadh, to Madinah, but someone has pick-pocketed me, so please help me out. I asked him to excuse me, as such an incident had taken place with me previously, that I had given the person 20 Riyals to buy petrol to reach Riyadh, but he went a little ahead and started to ask somebody else.
I got very angry and scolded him and warned him that I would call the soldiers, so he got very frightened.
Now the situation  has become, that we Muslims come on cars, with our families to beg throughout the day and gain at least two or three thousand illegally.
Whereas there is a clear Hadith of the Prophet (SAWS) that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand; the lower hand being the begging hand and the upper hand being the giving one.
May Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims (Amen, Amen)

The wife of famous singer Adnan Sami reached went to police station for blaming him of torturing her
, police has advised her to consult the court.
Saba Galadari wife of Adnan Sami has filed an application against him that Adnan Sami continuously tortures her
and behaves inhumanly,
Now she is fed up of this therefore case must be filed against him
, in place of filing case police asked her to consult the court by saying that this case is not under the jurisdiction of police.
In your opinion the blame of Adnan Sami's wife on him is true?
Is it not an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Do inform us with your opinion in this regard.
Adam, Sanghad, Mehr
As far as accusations go, any person can accuse the other.
To get enraged for honor is not sensible.
Whatever be the case between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he had left his honorable life and went to India to earn money. Now that fame has fallen around his neck.
This is the result of his own actions.
Washington...
High ambassadors of America say that President Obama will take a strong stand against Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
In America's new policy for Afghanistan, instead of development, war has been given more importance.
The envoys say that Hamid Karzai is being considered a barrier in the achievement of American goals in Afghanistan, as there is corruption in the government and the business of middlemen has increased and the Taliban are once more gathering strength.
The American envoys say that among the people in the American government who are stressing upon Hamid Karzai to do something more are Vice President Joseph Biden and President Obama's representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Hallbrooke.
He said that this policy appeared after President Bush, who used to video conference with Hamid Karzai every two weeks, left. He used to stress upon the American role in rebuilding Afghanistan and its civilian institutions.
Officials say that the Obama government would work with the State leaders rather than the central government.
The officials say that it will pressurize Karzai to step up the war against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing fresh elections this year, and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his group will support Karzai for presidency or not.
This statement of the American officials is not a precursor for a change in the American policy towards Afghanistan, is it?
Is Hamid Karzai's rule coming to an end?
What is your opinion about this?
In a series of three one day matches between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2-1.
Pakistan had defeated Sri Lanka in the first match, but Sri Lanka was victorious in the remaining two matches.
In the third one day match, the national cricket team's performance was very poor. In reply to Sri Lanka's 309 runs, it only managed to hit 75 runs in 23 overs before going all out. As such, it had to face a humiliating loss.
From the results of the series, it becomes evident that the performance of the national cricket team is not consistent.
Despite home ground and all claims, the national team suffered defeat. What do you think are the reasons?
Which aspects of the game should experts focus on?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
Which part do you place the responsibility of the loss on, fielding, batting or bowling?
Let us know of your opinion.
Malik Babar Husain, Jeddah. It is very sad that even in todays modern age, such ignorant traditions are prevalent. If the landlord or the property owner targets innocent people with his harsh dictatorship, who will call them Muslims?
Let any big shot walk on these burning coals. Why does the government allow them to do that?
When will court justice come into play?
Sir Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan for playing one day international series.
Visit of a foreign team to Pakistan, in spite of Pak India tension is a good sign.
On reaching Karachi Airport the Sir Lankan team was given a warm welcome.
Two matches will be held between Pakistan and Sir Lanka in Karachi while the third one will be played in Lahore.
Both teams are asserting highly regarding their batting, bowling and fielding.
If Siri Lanka venerates its spinners, Pakistan’s reliance is on its fast bowlers.
Sir Lanka’s captain Mahela Jayawardene says that no one player but the whole Pakistan cricket team is dangerous.
Muralidharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, while Pakistan’s captain says that this competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik has said “we have played Murali Dharan before and will take care of Mendis as well. We have made a secret game plan and will reveal it on the ground”.
Will the Pakistan and Sir Lanka series live up to claims of being interesting and thrilling?
Which side will dominate in the Pakistan and Siri Lanka series?
Who will win the series?
Who will be man of the series?
Inform us of your suggestions.
Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.

How is all this is double for these people, when the Kashmiri people have been fighting for independence for the last 60 years?
No, no one asked, and they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism, so they start talking about making up.
First they openly killed the Muslims, now they are in the efforts of setting things right.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating such a situation that the world's attention can be diverted from Kashmir.
but Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now the British Government is also understanding that the Indians are taking cover from their occupation over Kashmir by blaming Pakistan of terrorism.
and they hesitate to talk to Pakistan over this issue.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that by resolving the issue of Kashmir will bring an end to extremism, the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
it should be clear that the newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister while talking to media in Mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Is India using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialog?

I think Super powers don't want to destroy Pakistan
rather they are thinking of certain policies to control her they are familiar that Pakistan is an atomic power
want to bring some sort of revolution
Foreign countries believe that by cornering Pakistan few hurdles may generate want to support Pakistan and also wish to achieve their goal
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn Pakistan.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.

Ras al Khaima, This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is in how deep waters.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers movement not played any role?
What do you have to say about this statement of the Prime Minister?
Make us aware about your opinion.
American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference advised newly elected President Barack Obama saying that he had made many mistakes in his presidency, and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
'I did, as a president, whatever I felt was appropriate, according to the situation, and the American law and constitution, giving preference to American interest over my own acceptance'.
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him, and considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this is my last press conference, and I thank the journalists and other friends who are present in the press conference.
Do you think Obama will not repeat the mistakes that Bush made?
Did Bush delay accepting his mistake?
Will Obama be able to follow Bush's advice?

America is ambitious on the arrest of Usama and the search of Usama is on.
Will Dick Cheney's wish of arresting Usama be accomplished?

This is a sad calamity that Israeli is massacring the Palestinians and the same situation is prevalent in Kashmir, but there is no effect on the Security Council.
All the organisations present in Palestine and Kashmir should keep their war going until they gain independence, and they should form unity among themselves and keep facing any type of harm, and one day or the other their martyrdom will give fruit, God Willing.
Israeli air attacks are still continued on Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
The important leader of Hamas Nazaar Rayyan and family has been martyred.
The Security Council session ended without any decision.
America has opposed the censure resolution against Israel submitted by Lebia and other Arab countries in the session.
Israeli airplanes bombardment is continued since many days on Palestinian civil population.
The whole world reacted on Mumbai attacks but no country including America and England can see bloodshed caused by Israeli attacks.
Why the major countries of Muslim world are silent?
What will you wish to say on this double standard of the world.
Saeed, New York
I think that actually, most of our people are illiterate. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties, the electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The crisis of electricity and gas has worsen in whole of the Pakistan
, on the other hand gas prices have been raised by average 8, while in few cities unavailability of petrol created immense worry for people.
Intense reactions, riots and torturous demonstration are continued in the industrial and business circles of Pakistan against the crisis of electricity and gas.
Industrialists have threatened a shutdown ultimatum.
In Karachi people are worried due to 8 to 10 hours load shedding.
Industrial sector is almost paralyzed.
Government Institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other.
Increasing the prices of electricity and gas is not a joke with people?
Why the solutions of the problems are not considered?
Is government not seeing the full stop on national development?
What steps you will instantly recommend for managing this crisis?
Let us know your opinion.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that they are giving difficulty to the public who called for a democratic government.
The unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a torture.
There is no control over government institutions.
The law and order situation is getting worse, day to day. May Allah have mercy on this country.
The New Year started.

After ruling over America for eight years, President Bush left the White House, for presidential camp office, Camp David, so that the White House can be decorated and prepared for new President Barack Obama, according to his wishes.
In Bush's eight year presidency, the historic World Trade Center attack, the attack on the Pentagon, the action against Afghanistan and Iraq in the name of a global war against terrorism, in which armies of many countries were pulled into the war, and American resources were completely exhausted, were some of the memorable events of the Bush era.
As a result of this war, America had to face the worst economic and financial crisis in history.
What do you think the world got and what do you think they lost, as a result of this war?
Were the policies of President Bush successful?

The Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from touring Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, in an interview with Jeev News said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour, but due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step? Should sports not be separated from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision not harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that the security condition in India is bad, the England cricket team is continuing its tour, so why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this?
Salman, Karachi
Those people who are proud about going to India
and they make their films and videos over there, their eyes should open now, as to how much the people of India respect you.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan at the first opportunity, because he did not get honor there either.

After the Mumbai attacks, the mode of the Indians have changed.
Jagjeet Singh reacted by expressing that he hates Pakistan and Pakistanis.
It should be known that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsle and how has he become helpless now? Adnan Sami should stay in India. There is no need for him to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Aalam,
Karachi. I will only say so much about Jagjeet Singh, that he too changes colors like a chameleon,
and speaks on the occasion. Pakistanis, open your eyes and see how much you are respected in India. Do not be dull minded.
After the Mumbai incident, their hate filled speech has increased. Now they are spreading poison about famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to foreign news agency the situation has become funny when President Bush along with Prime Minister Noor Almalki in press conference at his office in Baghdad when an Iraqi journalist said to President Bush, ""Dog, this is farewell kiss"".
After this journalist removed his shoe and threw it at Bush, President bush expertly moved his head out of the way and saved himself.
Second shoe hit the American flag.
Security officials dragged him out of there.
On this occasion President Bush said I don't know why he did this, shoe was of size 10, I was not bothered.
Do you think that this action by the journalist depicts the anger of Iraqi people against President Bush.
What will you say about this?

Pakistan Army resources declared this incident as crucial.
Do you think India really intends to launch an air attack on Pakistan?
Is India's claim is correct that this violation was a mistake or it was objected to measure the capability of Pakistan Air Force.
Not this incident will increase tension between the two countries?

On this occasion, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Abdullah Husain Harun and other senior embassy agents were present.
What do you say about the former martyr Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto receiving this award?
Samir

It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she changed totally.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party, and made her son the representative of Peoples Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi, This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
But until the iron ax is not fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are just like this, that they are adopting secretive ways. This is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations have included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed as well as two other Pakistani citizens and that of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organisations into the list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaidah and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, practically non-existent organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba Operation Chief, Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organisations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organisations, they will be restricted from traveling and will be under arrest.
They will have to face cases.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India blaming these parties for the Bombay attacks without any proof?
Aren't there any terrorist groups in India?
Are International groups not aware of the tortures being done on the minorities in India?
Please inform us with your suggestions.

Karachi, our leaders should understand this that people, they are doing the operation against, are the true valuers of Pakistan, who are tolerating all kinds of tortures but they love Pakistan.
If there would be war then they will fight for Pakistan.
When their love would be felt, just condenming politics will not work. I think between both, there might be going a resulting war.
