     <seg id="1">First nuclear test was done in 1990</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.</seg>
    <seg id="3">In this book, called 'Nuclear Express', the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News, that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reid said that due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Among the factors are the design of the bomb, and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He further added that that was the reason that Pakistan was able to reply to India's Nuclear test with a nuclear test in just 2 weeks and 3 days.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961, Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test, in response to which America took 17 days to preform a test, despite having this bomb for a long time.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He added that the atom bomb that was tested on May 19th 1998 by Pakistan was made very carefully and that Pakistani scientists had complete reliance on it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reid was asked whether China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said because India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that there was proof available that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and later on the documents which were received from Libya also verify this fact.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Upon another question, as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that we also believe that Israel also has access to the results of this testing.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reid was also asked about China's nuclear distribution program which is going on.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Upon that Thomas Reid said that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Asfahan, Iran since 1991.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Apart from this, China provided Iran with the nuclear enrichment plant in Kheraj.</seg>

    <seg id="4">when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.</seg>
    <seg id="5">The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 to one Billion Euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle went into deep pressure.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had got to this position from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic powet.</seg>
    <seg id="8">After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quick, putting it on new lines.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm, Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm always had special importance.</seg>

    <seg id="3">Bush said that the enemy terrorists are waiting patiently to attack America, and they have a strong determination to attack America so America should never be unaware about its security.</seg>
    <seg id="4">The American President ignored the hurts and suffering of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, and defended his policies saying that America is still the biggest supporter country of independence. However commentators do not accept the reality of the unpopular president's remarks, as America is neither a supporter of freedom, nor a supporter of human rights, but rather it is the most mischievous country in the world, which not only supports a blood thirsty country like Israel, but is also directly involved in its crimes.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Israel, openly kills children, women and civilians and the American president is congratulating them. This is the American humanity and freedom which the world is seeing in Gaza and other places.</seg>

   </hl>
    <seg id="2">According to a new research, three cups of tea a day,</seg>
    <seg id="3">if taken, can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age, by more than a third.</seg>
    <seg id="4">In a research carried out by the Moffitt Cancer Institute, in the American state of Florida, it was revealed that the risk of occurrence of breast cancer tumors, in such women below the age of 50 years</seg>
    <seg id="5">who drink at least three cups of tea a day, is reduced by up to 37%.</seg>
    <seg id="6">It was also revealed in the research that there was no significant benefit, in these regards, in the woman aged above 50, who drank three or more cups of tea a day.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Experts believe that the reason for this is that tea has such ingredients in it, which are more effective against specific tumors which generally occur in women below the age of 50.</seg>
    <seg id="8">In Moffitt Cancer Center, in the city of Tampa, Florida state, a research was conducted on over 5000 women, who had undergone treatment for breast cancer.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles with women who were safe from breast cancer.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The experts also found out that on a specific type of cancer called lobular cancer, the drinking of tea has shown clear effects, and has decreased its occurrence by 66 percent.</seg>
    <seg id="12">A tenth of every breast cancer patient suffers this type of cancer.</seg>
    <seg id="13">This type of cancer is more dangerous because it is deeper and is usually only known after it spreads quite a bit.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Experts say that regular tea consumption, at least three cups a day, can drastically reduce the occurrence of breast cancer in young women.</seg>
    <seg id="15">They say that making tea a regular beverage taken on a daily basis and included in ones daily activities causes the suitable defense required against cancer in the body.</seg>

    <seg id="3">exercise at any age is good for health.</seg>

    <seg id="6">experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.</seg>
    <seg id="7">According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="12">In which the pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.</seg>
    <seg id="13">The experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They learnt that as people grew old, there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says that as age increases, the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear, and this affects the ability to exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Garwin  Cain was also a part of this study.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this. And this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="18">Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.</seg>
    <seg id="19">If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart, they can achieve the benefits of excercise, despite the increase in age.</seg>

     <seg id="2">All police are running here and there, but don't ask about illegal parking.</seg>
     <seg id="3">What's more, NYPD traffic was not in the state where it could look at illegally parked vehicles.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Something like this happened, that a plane of the US Air really became a ship and landed in the Hudson river.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Until now, we only now that terrorists are of the descendants of geese.</seg>
     <seg id="6">Yesterday was perhaps historic cold, in New York.</seg>
     <seg id="7">The temperature does not fall this much.</seg>
     <seg id="8">Even my jaws started hurting from my half an hour walk outside.</seg>
     <seg id="9">Imagine, how the people who jumped from the plane into the river would have felt.</seg>
     <seg id="10">It is a matter of happiness that all people were safe.</seg>
     <seg id="11">And it was sad that the companies plane drowned during this financial crisis.</seg>
     <seg id="12">I went by West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I still do?</seg>
     <seg id="13">Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.</seg>
     <seg id="14">Thankfully, in my one hour trip, the way had opened at least a bit, so I was able to get the 56th street exit.</seg>
     <seg id="15">Otherwise, I had not taken the previous two exits, seeing the lines waiting at them.</seg>

     <seg id="2">they kept expressing their grief by demolishing a women's school and college somewhere every day.</seg>
     <seg id="3">but just like other ideas, this idea did not also come true, according to this report by CNN, today on the sacred day of Monday this Taliban gang of Swat have blasted a boy's school.</seg>
