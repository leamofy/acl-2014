     <seg id="1">First nuclear test was done in 1990</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.</seg>
    <seg id="3">In this book, called 'Nuclear Express', the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News, that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reid said that due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Among the factors are the design of the bomb, and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He further added that that was the reason that Pakistan was able to reply to India's Nuclear test with a nuclear test in just 2 weeks and 3 days.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961, Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test, in response to which America took 17 days to preform a test, despite having this bomb for a long time.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He added that the atom bomb that was tested on May 19th 1998 by Pakistan was made very carefully and that Pakistani scientists had complete reliance on it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reid was asked whether China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said because India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that there was proof available that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and later on the documents which were received from Libya also verify this fact.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Upon another question, as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that we also believe that Israel also has access to the results of this testing.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reid was also asked about China's nuclear distribution program which is going on.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Upon that Thomas Reid said that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Asfahan, Iran since 1991.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Apart from this, China provided Iran with the nuclear enrichment plant in Kheraj.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He said that China has been providing Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt and Libya with nuclear technology through North Korea.</seg>

   </hl>
    <seg id="3">exercise at any age is good for health.</seg>
    <seg id="4">it energizes your heart, reduces the cholesterol level, helps in keeping the weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer or dementia.</seg>
    <seg id="5">unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.</seg>
    <seg id="6">experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.</seg>
    <seg id="7">According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="12">In which the pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.</seg>
    <seg id="13">The experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They learnt that as people grew old, there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says that as age increases, the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear, and this affects the ability to exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Garwin  Cain was also a part of this study.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this. And this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="18">Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.</seg>
    <seg id="19">If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart, they can achieve the benefits of excercise, despite the increase in age.</seg>

     <seg id="2">More than three hundred Israeli citizens have died so far in these attacks.</seg>
     <seg id="3">Now, after the air strikes, Israeli tanks have reached the Gaza border, completely prepared to launch a land offensive.</seg>
     <seg id="4">The Security Council of the United Nations, through an agreed upon resolution passed in an emergency meeting, have demanded that Israeli and Palestinian authorities stop extremist activities immediately.</seg>
     <seg id="5">However, Israeli officials claim that they will continue their action in Gaza until they are convinced that Israel will be safe from rocket attacks.</seg>
     <seg id="6">In your opinion, is the statement by Israel, that this is an Israeli struggle for safety, acceptable?</seg>
     <seg id="7">In this situation, is the global brotherhood doing its job?</seg>

     <seg id="2">And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="3">To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.</seg>
     <seg id="5">From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.</seg>
     <seg id="6">But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.</seg>
     <seg id="7">We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.</seg>
     <seg id="8">It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God</seg>
     <seg id="9">This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.</seg>
     <seg id="10">It was not even 30 minutes for us working that our younger son said “Dad it feels like I am not born for this job.</seg>
     <seg id="11">We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="12">Son started saying that I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work .</seg>
     <seg id="13">Three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home.</seg>
