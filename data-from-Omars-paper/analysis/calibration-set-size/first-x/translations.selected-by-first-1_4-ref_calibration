'first nuclear experiment was done in 1990'
Thomas Reid who has worked in the Lever national laboratory of America as a Weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the Ex director of technical intelligence at Las Elmos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.
this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.
in an interview with US news, Thomas Reid said that in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's rule, China experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Thomas Reid said that based to many reasons, he has a belief that China had experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
the reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.

Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.

The Role of EU for peace in the Middle east.
from official point of view, the role of European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
according to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
European Union's spokesman Amadeu Altafaj has said that every such effort is adorable which is helpful in sending the European Union's message to the opponents of the war.
it seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned.
but in reality the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
as the head of the Union, Czech republic's role is even weaker than before.
an on top of that the internal issues have made is helpless.
on the other hand the French president Sarkozy is behaving like if he is still the president of the European Union.
Whereas France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it.
The most ridiculous situation faces the foreign minister of France, Bernard Kouchner.
He is part of the delegation, which is being headed by Schwarzenberg, the foreign minister of Czech Republic.
What is even worse is that both the foreign ministers are giving different statements on the middle east war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself whereas according to Kouchner this war does not come under defense policy. On the other side, Germany has also sent its special ambassador to Middle East. European Union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues.
Its evidence is the reaction of Israel who does not pay an importance to the conciliation efforts of the EU.
EU has a golden chance of getting something done. Because America has lost in the Middle East due to the policies of George Bush.
Economic setback: Suicide of German billionaire industrialist.
Adolf Meerklay, residing in the area of Sawabia in southern Germany, has though left a great business group behind him.
But earlier common German citizens did not know much about him.
Later when he had to conference, about the loan given to his industrial group, with almost 30 banks for many weeks, he also became topic of the headlines. And he could see a dark future of Meerklay groups.
The Merkel Group had to suffer financial losses of many millions of Euro after its investment to buy shares of German auto maker Volkswagen.
Then monetary institutions canceled this groups loan amounting 700 million and another 1 billion Euro that it necessarily required and hence Merkel came into extreme pressure.
Some time back the bank agreed to provide Merkel Group an emergency loan but Adolf Merkel who raised from a small industrialist to the position of a strong industrial group whose annual income was approximately 30 billion Euro, could not bare the loss in his investment capability.
Adolf Merkel, after the death of his parents started managing the business and took to modernize it.The business under his supervision became very popular and became more strong.
He named his company Ratiopharm which is today Germany's very large acclaimed and successful pharmaceutical company.
Some time back the commercial value of this company was in between 5 and 6 billion Euro and still was earning a revenue of 8.1 billion Euro annually. After the great success of Ratiopharm, the Merkel Group acquired many big businesses which included building materials maker Hydelberg cement to modified/special car maker Kassbohrer company.
The workforce of Merkel Group is nearly about 100,000 throughout the world and its assets include Ratiopharm which always was the most important business in the portfolio.
Adolf Merkel during his liftime expressed the view may a time that " It has been four generations that we have been in pharmaceutical business.
Now the management of this institution is with my children and I hope this institution will be for few hundred years be managed by and in possession of my family.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, the banks have provided approval for temporary loans of 400 million Euro for VEM Group but added the condition that VEM should sell off Ratiopharm to improve the financial situation for a long term sustainability.
Like this, after the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain the same as it was.

According to the fresh statistics, crime rate among the immigrants from 2004 to 2007 is
Reduced from 9.22%
to 4.21%
According to Joachim Herrmann, the interior minister of Baweria province, this is apparently a positive change.

Therefore this should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German but his background is foreign.
Herrmann said that his province will take this in to account when gathering statistics in 2010.
Besides Baweria, Hamburg is also thinking in the same lines.
Senator for foreign affairs from CDU, Christoph Ahlhaus has said: "When research is done in a scientific manner, the man can not pre-decide its results but it is based on the facts and figures that come out as a result of the research.
Ahlhaus diverted the attention to a research report from the anti crime's provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamberg, it was investigated that out of all crimes happening there what percentage have the involvement of foreigners.
results showed that the foreigners here have
the crime rate was less as compared to the crimes allover the province.
in contrast when in 2006 a survey was done on crimes in youth in Berlin, it came up that young people having foreign background had a percentage of .44
was 7 percent
However, other political parties of Germany for example, SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei were against this proposal that while collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired that which German citizen has a foreign background.

Tea: Effective cure of Chest Cancer
In a new research it is being told that drinking 3 cups of tea everyday
reduces the danger of chest cancer in women under 50 years of age by 1/3rd.
The research happening in the Moffitt Cancer Center in the American State of Florida, has showed that chances of getting tumor of chest cancer in those women under 50 years of age
is reduced by 37%, who drink at least three cups of tea everyday.
It is also told in the research that it does not help older women even if they drink three or more cups of tea daily.
Specialists think that this is because of the presence of such components in tea that are more effective against such types of cancer tumors, which usually targets women under 50 years of age.
Research was done on 5000 women who had treatment done for Chest Cancer at Moffitt  Cancer Center founded in city Tampa of State of Florida.
Their ages are between 20 and 74 years.
Specialists compared their medical records and lifestyle to those women who are free from chest cancer.

Every 10th chest cancer patient has this kind of cancer.

why reduce exercise with the age?
new research
exercise at any age is good for health.
it energizes your heart, reduces the cholesterol level, helps in keeping the weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer or dementia.
unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.
experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.
Dr. Pattricia P. Leka of Maya clinic Minnesota says that increase in age is a big reason for being handicapped from exercise and less physical activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo clinic.
She headed a research regarding heart diseases and man's ability to do exercise in older age.
Team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart.
In which heart's activity of pumping blood and its contraction and relaxation was studied.
Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.
They came to know that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.
Dr. Patricia says with increase in age, problems occur in the activity of relaxation of heart and with increase in age, this effects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research
He says that we were surprised to see that it has an effect  and it confirmed that bad exercising ability is very much related to the heart relaxing activity.
some times blood pressure can cause disorders in heart's functions and heart diseases.
if the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard, then they can take advantage of the benefits of exercise even with the age.
a detailed report in this matter is published in a magazine of American Medical Association.
No chances of an immediate war with Pakistan: Indian Army chief
Indian Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan how ever we are always ready to defend our country and sacrifice our lives for it.
He has accused that despite of commitments and international pressure on Pakistan as a result of Mumbai attacks, the infrastructure of terrorism is not only existent but also proactive in Pakistan.
he said this while talking to the correspondents in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day tour to the valley of Kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in New Delhi administered Kashmir and preparation of armed forces on the borders.
He was asked a question, that according to the media reports Pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from India regarding the Mumbai attacks, what were his thoughts about it.
General Kapoor said that the decisions of peace or war matters are taken by the political leadership.
Talking about the presence of the skeleton of terrorism on the land of Pakistan,he said allegedly, that India will fight against such circumstances who are ready to destroy peace and weaken India.
He said that there are around 7 to 800 fighters present on the land of Indian Kashmir from which almost 50% are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that only with the betterment in the weather, the efforts of encroachment between Pakistan and Kashmir under its government can be increased.  Although India has increased security on the boarders.
They have refused to the possibility of reduction in the number of army soldiers in Indian Kashmir by stating that one can not compromise over the country's security.
May God answer the world's prayers and may Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, but we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan , effected by this change, are in our favor.
That what will Mr. Barrack Obama give to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams.
The oath taking of Obama as the president of America, whose part of the name is also Hussain, is where historically important in all the ways, is also a great challenge for the history.
Not only for his own self but also for those who supported him with all their hearts.
This challenge will also be for the white majority as it is not easy for them to accept that a colored man is ruling over them.
Here, South Asia, specially Muslims who have expectations from them, should remember that he has been elected as the president of America. And Obama should remember that President of America is actually the President of the entire world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have to have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, so this will be a win for people who love him.
What will be its effect on South Asia and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan.

Dear, whether it is Obama or some one else, the decision of the policy of the entire world is done by Jews lobby of  billionaires, influencing, powerful and effective people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts,the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is in front of everyone.
Even after the creation on Pakistan the governance of Swat was in the hands of its King who even had his own army and law.
With a help of an agreement they transferred the administration of Swat to the Pakistan government.
But it's disheartening to know that our government treated Swat like how a step mother would treat anothers child.
After the end of the governance of the King there were no more schools founded in Swat.
And neither was the areas development given any notice.
Currently the number of girls acquiring education is far less than in previous years.
The Taliban are continuing their attacks on educational institutions in the NWFP.
Swat has suffered the highest number of schools destroyed and the majority of them have been girl schools.
And not just that, the Taliban have also announced a ban on education for girls.
Thousands of students are being deprived of education.
what do you think, by stopping girls' education, what the Taliban want to achieve?
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities so far.
what do you think the government should do.
the question should be that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
because the people of Swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them, otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that during the Curfew. How come people can be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing.
when the writ of the government is not being let implemented, how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities?
now the question arises that having an armed force, armed with modern weapons, modern technologies and intelligence system, why the government can not control these few Taliban.
the only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head, that neither their arms end nor they are apprehended.
result of the discussion is that Taliban with their wrong steps are making it easier for the imperialists.
fifteen years before the war was continued in Afghanistan.
ISI is controlling Taliban when at that time opponent was north coalition who was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly situation changed, actions of Taliban began to appear.
And ISI was also offered Dollars from America so past friends became enemies.
Now situation is this that war continues but helping in Pakistan are still those Iran, India and Russia.
Unless this feeling does not emerge in Human that what is right and wrong till then Human will keep doing mistakes.
As an example a thief when goes to steal if he at that time gets this thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse, there is also punishment in it and he fears from God then that Human will not steal.
Same like this that unless Israel do not gets this apprehension that i am doing wrong and draining blood of innocents and i will get punishment for this, he will keep playing Holi with the blood innocents of Gaza till then.
Respects!
Question is that is war, armed movement, terrorism is solution to problems?
If not then what is the specific prescription which takes to the solution of the problems?
this is right that war, is a destructive way it never solves problems instead it increases it.
Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq should adopt these models in order to get Independence which Nelson Mandela uses in South Africa
to fight more for social , ethical and subjective rather than armed.
kashmiri's participation in election shows that they have accepted this point.
Israeli attacks are going on Gaza from 3 weeks and death toll has reached to 1000.
world diplomacy efforts has till now not resulted in a cease fire
an according to one survey , attacks after 27th December has resulted in 90,000 Palestine leaving there homes and moving towards a safer place
on the other hand, NGOs has accused Israel for not taking care of Palestine Kids and said that one whole Generation of Palestine Kids are in serious cycology and emotional trouble.

Give Taliban a Chance.
Basit, Peshawar
Wake up! If Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down girls schools?
And kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
These Taliban has damaged Islam so much that no other nation or religion has done.
Pashtoon Rore
Kohat, Pakistan
if the whole Muslim world just give a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see that how upset will its father America be.
and immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well.
but what can be done, where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from.
someone tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step as he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
the responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on Arabs and the Muslim world but its and obligation on the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny.
this unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
Just like in Pakistan and India before 30th June or the end of the fiscal year, the government institutions are looted, the American regime just before its end have given a green signal to Israel to do what ever it wants.
on one hand America says that effort will be made for ceasefire.
On the other hand United Nations is passing resolution after resolution but practically both had been futile. This only concludes one idea that  to oppress Muslims the United Nations is also a party to the Muslim oppression.
All Muslim countries should immediately revoke their United Nations membership and lay foundation for a united Muslim Union.
There are many evident examples in front of us,in which America and the United Nations only promises and passes resolutions. It is the Muslims in the end who suffer.
What is the use of this probaganda when BBC is not going to publish it.
Now where are all the journalism principles. When it comes to muslims blood BBC seems to take its eyes off the reality.
By the way self proclaimed leader of rights.
Pubslishing something from their own sounds far, they even din't publish the discussions.
On be half of the muslims
The only difference in you and the Jews is the latter call themselves Jews, they martyr Muslims and living amongst Muslims like you they call themselves Muslims

For a long time on BBC forums, sometimes suicide bombing and other times terrorism in India was used to target a certain sect.
The favorite word of these Anti-Islamic discussions was Extremism.
You can get a very good idea, about who an extremist is, from the above discussion in which, writing against Iran was almost considered blasphemy.
When will our muslims understand that Anti Christ can not be fought with swords.
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what shall one do other than crying?
But the basic fault is of this turmoil and massacre which by naming Jihad, we try to blacken the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of Palestinians accepted the existence of Israel then why did Hammas need to fire those rockets on Israel and made suicide attacks?
Attitude of the both the sides is against humanity.
The role of UN and the USA was again seen as favoring towards the injustice of Israel.
May Allah give muslim nation the understanding of becoming  united. Ameen!
and the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism, after all they are doing the real work.
otherwise, is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are.
so in this situation, in common terms it is called DADAGEERI which means do what ever you can.
That it even hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry.
medicines for injured, and coffins for the dead are being supplied by the Arab leaders and asked that
Should the Israeli attacks take place?
this is the actual problem that the leaders of Muslim countries including Saudi crownprince are in a false sleep, neither they have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
they should take immediate measures against Israel.
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Salam to All brothers and sisters!
i think at this hard time advising hammas to stop struggling in the name of peace would be injustified with thousands of widows and millions of orphans, and it would be similar to prove them wrong.
If israel and its followers are at peak of cruelty then soon a revolution to stop all this is going to show up because this is the law of nature. America and isreal's steps are upbringing suicide bombers.
they can can not understand who are blind in trance of power.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Now hammas and israel should befriended to stop blood shed.
Muhammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France.
very rightly said.
Assumingly if hammas is 100% right and by fighting against malice it gets higher place in the eyes of God even then atleast they should realize if by good deeds peace of others home is shattered then that act is no longer a good deed.
those who claim to love God, His Prophet(P.B.U.H) and their religion, to love humanity is part of their belief.
consequently after muslims confiscation of everybody on earth is Allah's order.
Najeeb-ur-Rahman Psycho *Lahore* [Pakian]
No! It is not decreed to annihilate but it is decreed to invite people to Islam.
But people who do conspiracies against the religion, it is decreed to do Jihad against them.
One should fight with them until they finish their conspiracies. But this certainly does not mean that they can wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the consequence of a murderer of children is disaster.
But its a request to my friends that yesterday Israelis did not have a roof over their heads and today they are so strong that they do not listen to anyone because all Jews are one.
They do not have Shiite nor Sunni, all are just Jews. And they have succeeded in every field and made everything.
Opposite to this, what is the condition of 55 Islamic Countries?
Lagging in every field and now the condition is this that they are so helpless that enemies are killing them and they are waiting for their death.
Point required is that all Muslim countries should get together and should make a plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better course of action than accepting Israel. Learn new technology and ways of success from them and let the world live in peace.
Muslims have great land and resources.
The need is correct usage.
First of all, the most tragic part is that Hammas and Alfatah could not be united.
The only reason to destroy great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin was to weaken the only nation fighting for Aqsa Mosque. And it was impossible until Yasir and Yasin were removed from the way.
The world is watching that how Palestine was falling down every second after the death of these two leaders.
And  how this lobby of jews strengthened their target by every moment.
In 1974, a Pakistani Prime minister was in such world power that he led all the muslim leaders under one roof with 100% attendance first time in the history.
Today, on his 81st birthday, is it hard for this nation to make a promise that whether it will unite itself or not.
also, while eradicating the differences between other Muslims,  its (The formation of Islamic common wealth) mission will be carried forward
its a monster that has gripped Palestine for half a century.
this monster has many faces.
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
and its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
this monster is most unhappy with Islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through Islam, Muslims, the perfect religion of Muslim and Practical Islam as the history tells that Islam has put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since 27th of December.
more that 3 hundred Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
after the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
however the Israeli authorities say that they will continue operation in Gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
in your opinion, is this claim of Israel true that it's doing all this for defending the sovereignty of Israel?
is the world community playing its role in such situation?
does this aggression has an indirect relation with the coming elections in Israel?
can any improvement be expected in the situation in Middle East after the succession of the newly elected American president Barak Obama.

after all a neutral impression is to be maintained.

Zaheer Chughtai
in this art now a days the Pakistani electronic and print media, specially some Urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone, who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the "grudge of Muavia" written on them.
has said that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. how long this hypocrisy will continue.
Why there is so much atrocity on Muslims. If people like America leave backing up of Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So if Americans you have courage then leave backing up of them and see then their fate of life.
So-called writers and murderers in name of peace should understand that peace in the world can only and only be obtained through giving justice not through genocides.
If any nations can be perished through genocide and results of choice can be obtained then after actions of Hitler, existence of Jews and their uprising was impossible.
As poet says.
Atrocity is atrocity, it vanishes when it rises.
Blood is blood, clots when drop.
Now who will tell whom what is terrorism?
Is this comes in terrorism, why? because own pain is only felt.
Other people are not humans or blood of Muslims is so cheap or color of these innocent's was not red?
And now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere?
I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.
Dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood, how shall we condemn, I can not find words!
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims that on one side people are being killed in India so the rest of the world comes over Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations otherwise we will do it ourselves!
And on the other side, Israel is killing generations of muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent. This is unbearable!
There is delay but not NEVER in the house of God and only then will this darkness shed. Then
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Considering elections, the rulers should do such activities for people's support. There is no doubt in this specially when countries like Israel exist. Rest talking about Barrack Obama, then history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy and nor will do it. Regime, whether black or white, is a regime.
The debate going on in the forum makes it clear that every one is sad on Benazir's death but as a politician, one can not ignore her mistakes.
This talk requires debate that whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was so dear then  why was it left in 10 year dictatorship of Musharaf until American clearance and the deal.
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the stratocracised public needed her, unfortunately she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised.
when each and every historic personality is being accused, there is no one to say any thing over this.
Sana Khan
few things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done of them.

Sir/Sir probably you should not only study Pakistan's history but that of 4 friend and 7 other countries, may be you would agree with Psycho's point of view.

Britain never let them unite and established the Hindu-Muslim conflict which was later on brought up by Sir Syed.

How merciless is our nation. We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.
We have succeeded a lot!
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar if you en wreathe him with books.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks but Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.
If they talk about war then both the sides will suffer human loss.
India says that Pakistani citizen is caught in Bombay attacks. And he has written and sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. But earlier, when India caught this extremist, said that he is a smart engineer but later they declared him to have studied only four grades. This is what has to be considered.
First of all, merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and  all christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
we do not want the flames of fire but flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
will war give solution to problems.
it will bless with fire and blood.
will give hunger and exigence.
therefore wise humans
its better to avoid war
in yours and ours yards
its better that the glim keeps lightened
the India-America relations have deepened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
this is also the old history of America.
in case of and Indian attack, America would get its goals and the expense would be on India as well.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation and ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
this is the Islamic history.
even before this resolution the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it more clever that effected and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has relaxed its pressure now.
while ignoring India's unnecessary bobbery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a "Side Effect" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
There seems to be two opinions that it is not a very brutal action.
But the question is, on Monday when thousands of Taliban villages were attacklled by samiuah, and the Pakistani army and was where with them?
The army to should not be accountability that a year, he said there?
Thousands are killed every day, the number of the mortar shells and battery, the number is very uneasy for Taliban .
The ISI, I appeal to the Taliban that only thing and we will give tutelage heaven Benazir Swat to the peace.
And the fake operation.
The day is not far when in UN resolution of Army intrusion in Pakistan will be approved just like the one against Jamat Aldawa.
Riaz Ahmed Farooqi
First our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in UN,
and suppose if this resolution took time to approve then considering the example of America any country will launch the attack at her own.
The Israeli army samiullah adverse, and we achievements and not the information sargarmiya.
A few minutes later he was not revolutionary.
The way kamaridche gawera , nawab akber khan Bugti, Dr.najeebullah  and thousands of protestors bodies were disrespected by the hands of enemies.
They are deathless even after being dead.
But here an international game is being played. Here ferrocity and animosity is created to do the ruling.
So there can be reason created that if we are not here then these vandals and animals can come take over the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
America sees the torture of these extremists but instead of being sad on these faithless activities, they easily name them as tribal culture.
The reason for these faithless activities, sometimes given in the name of tribal culture and other times in the name of Islam, is not something done by a person with a heart.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so brave that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also men of God and so is our army.
It is very clear that there is fishy.
instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and lesson gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell,
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Who burnt the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on the refusal of oath after the Prophet (PBUH) passed away and how took her husband by the rope in his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
The army's pilgrimage to the enemy  and what  Karbala and what the axle?
Without the facts and accept are unsafe, not a check.
O' BBC please stop this dual-headed policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
please show some modesty, a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office.
the success of, operation Sherdil and across the border operation Lion heart, depends on the fact that in whose favor is the opinion of general public.
this act is of American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahab is a victim of this conspiracy.
all discussions on this forum will now be anti Taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined Taliban and they are doing what can change the public opinion.
i have only the question all the day that what will the force doing when the dead body was hanging the hole day,are they sitting in country to kill the normal people those say like this two children and thier mother dead by bombing on Taliban houses.
Were they not know about that chowk?
Or they were seeing a film action?
We say it with excuse that stop this game for Allah sake.
At last there is a commander upon you also.
The BBC, was asked the question is not enough to write to see the superficialness regret, for example, a question did not present in the Swat 30 thousand army has been to what?
The Taliban of army fight the dead bodies are all day bleeding on electric poles there.
The Green sawati step, the Pakistani army has 100, media, including the BBC, the real world and the reality, is not a good ignoramus.
The Pakistani army drama.
The Swat child is that it is a bloody drama.
Only thing bus to drama.
The Taliban has destroyed the name of muslims
if the pure muslims of whole worlds does tell them as a muslim, they wont get any place to leave for the terror
Those are not interested in doing work, and not interested in leaving a peaceful life, and they take guns and join those people
Islam has not came under the pressure of gun or sword
Shame on you
there is no reason for this in any religion or in any families
BBC along with other media's has gathered information about Taliban
but, the reality is not even known to any one, that what is the real situation, we only know because we are tribals
BAsically it is a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD, and our ISI,are involved, there is no one in from taliban or from tribal, the was created by terror from above agencies, who are insulting Taliban, Islam, Madarsa's, Pestos, and Tribals
due to this action Muslims head down with shyness.
i salute MQM Leader Altaf Hussain, ANP and PPP leaders who are against this cancer it means talk against Taliban.
this cancer creates by Ziaulhaq, he left but also destroy Pakistan.
but i am hopeful that percent leadership will end this cancer.
India after Mumbai attack said that behind this attack there was a hand of Pakistani extremest.
Pakistan denies that blames and said he will give all possible help to India in interrogation.
India said that it give one list to Pakistan in which shows suspected names of extremist which India required.
now Pakistan said that listed name of Jaish Muhammad Leader Mulana Masood Azhar hide him self and government did not have any information about him.
before that Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari disapproved that image that western secret agencies and Indian government give evidence to Pakistan about Mumbai attack.
president Zardari said about Ajmal Qasaab that this was not prove that he is Pakistani.
meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned Pakistan that its relation with India can not improve unless its land is being used for terrorism.
and in a latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to Pakistan.
should these political instances affect over the sports?
what do you see as the future of Pakistan and India relations.
Neither America will break Pakistan nor India.
Pakistan will be broken by Pakistanis themselves.
what do you expect after so much provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism.
although Jinnah also did not do good to the Muslims of India and it has been proven with time.
Yasmin, Chicago.
Madam, if Mr. Jinnah's vision was followed, neither the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism had spread in Pakistan nor the Muslims in India had undergone such behavior.
but it's our fault that we could not bring up a leader like his stature.
if we can not care for our heroes, then
this region has great capabilities.
god knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
in both countries the enemies to peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv sena, RSS have been raised.
and the evil powers don't want this region to progress therefore these countries are controlled like puppets.
can you imagine what status will this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world.
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
may Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
but Sir, open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
moreover, the internal affairs don't seem to be good, as you can see the circumstances in NWFP, Balochistan and in Karachi in Sindh.
in this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
O Allah bestow your mercy upon us.
Account to my understanding, a final war is inevitable.
this is enough of it.
now it should be do or die.
this problem can not be solved through these acts of insincere dialogues.
and not through small scale terrorism in each other's country.
after all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
and if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all of our political parties agree on this matter that these terrorist and denominational activities should be terminated from the country.
But our army rule does not seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, American and Europe are made to believe that we are with you on this war against terrorism and the other hand, we also help Taliban secretly.
We have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way. Thank you.
There is no doubt in this that majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are the members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined  the party  named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.
Although these members preferred subsidiary activities and now after India's great persistence, The United Nation has invalidated it also and Government of Pakistan is continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it is better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
Terrorist groups present in Pakistan, who support professional criminals and the heads of those Mullahs are those who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.
And now they are doing everything to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called Human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan from these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous or not?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose work is only to kill.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What kind of world is this where it is hard to live for one who takes the name of one major pillar of Islam,  religion of Allah.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims but when Muslims even try to take revenge, all our hypocrite leaders together with all the non-muslim world treat people with the true and right pain of religion just like our great leader Hafiz Saeed is being treated today.
India in impunity of Bombay attacks.
Pakistan relation are bitter. Better relationship as a result of last few years between the two countries have been jolted  greatly.
India has always held the military and non-military groups in Pakistan responsible.
And bringing relationship back on track is being conditioned by operations against these groups.
For as much, Indian security departments have held Lashkher-e-Tayyaba responsible for the Bombay attacks.
In this case, name of Jamat-ud-Dawa has come in the front many times.
This is the first time that relation between both the countries have worsen due to a terrorist activity in India
In December 2001, after the attacks on Indian Parliament, these two neighbors were on the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
Now Jamat-ud-Dawa, about which Security analysts say that it is in reality a new face of Lashker-e-Tayyaba. Restrictions on the party are being requested.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan do decisive operations against extreme activists on its land?
By banning Jamat-ud-Dawa, can  current Pak-India crisis be over?
crisis be over? and how important is it to close down the armed groups to keep constant peace between both countries?
Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly?
What the Security Council against Muslims endorses such activity is not showned?
To say that the plaintiff slow are witness mercurial!
India, itself has become a failed government!
The army, intelligence  and other security institutions have failed, the terrorists who hands may carry 72 hours of the Defense Department was Round and its failure of India accused Pakistan of put and the entire world.
A pagan killed the should be a noise around the world are bandaged. this song huddled?
Countries only religious and non-political, Welfare Organization.
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
Our prophet (directives for), scholars and all the saints love the people and gave respect to them, Islam remains a  peaceful religion.
The Muslims have also progressed on war grounds.
When this beautiful  anarchy  climed deen started then MOMIN and pagan fulfill their dreams of violence and the opening new chapter started first aware of the 'not.
Salam- Please do it with pleasure but act at your own.
do not do it under American pressure.
if India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
And why it accuses us of every thing?
there are extremist groups and organizations in India as well, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the world?
What India is doing in Kashmir, what is that?
What Israel is doing, what is that?
the truth is; we are the first Nuclear Muslim State and why; this is the main issue.
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart and circumstances also seems to be such
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be the part of this conspiracy.
American are not slowly but now very swiftly tightening there grip over Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances,if we as a nation does not display unity and solidarity then if Bangladesh can be created,anything else can also happen.
More the terrorism is condemned lessor it is , whether it is in a Hotel at Mumbai or it is in Marriott Hotel Islamabad or it is in Palestine.
Like wise irrespective of the origin of the terrorist, these should be eliminated, no matter these are Pakistanis or Indian or American or Israelite.
Now the question is that why the whole world including the Pakistani officials are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack carried out on Marriott Hotel was not a terrorist attack?
then why-
hale to the advisor for interior Rehman Malik, how brave and bold has the gentleman become.
no imgage
not only this, but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under 'someones's pressure'.
wow, all praise to the Almighty!
whether having the ability or not or to say that I don't want.
We, the Pakistanis are fighting whose war.
and why we have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect.
No one has  a right to interfere anyone's national affairs.
The colonial system is apparently not there.
If people are sure to have justice or Allies support the importance of free judiciary and give respect to democratic institutes and dont support the dictatorial governments; peace can be achieved in third world countries including Pakistan. But this is not acceptable for allies
Pakistan is always in line with European and American interests.
Pakistan is forced to do so despite a majority of its population oppose it.
This enhances the opposite or anti sentiments.
If America and its Allies believe in Democracy, they should give up their colonial behavior and leave this region
Pakistan has ability to arm or disarm.
Security forces raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
Pressure is being increased on Pakistan for taking rapid action against extremist organizations after Mumbai attacks.
India blames Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Secretary Condolisa Rice asked Pakistani leadership to take practical measures for instant and transparent action against the responsible s of Mumbai attacks.
She says that no doubt the extremists responsible for Mumbai attacks used Pakistani soil.
During this Peshawar Government says that unknown armed persons has set another truck stand for supply of goods to Allied Forces deployed in Afghanistan on fire, due to which more then fifty vehicles are destroyed.
It is the second attack on Neto and American supplies during 48 hours in Peshawar.
During this Pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from Karachi to Tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action.
It is revealed that during the reign of General Zia ul Huq because of the invasion of the ex USSR in Afghanistan and its resistance started by the American and Saudi funding resulted in the birth of armed groups of which Pakistan unable to terminated could not get back herself to the era before 1980s.
The question is does Pakistan want to do it?
Is Pakistan capable of doing this?
What do you think?

I have got a single question from all of the human right champions.
It is impossible for them to stand infront of you with neclaces if you kill their childeren.
NO TRANSLATION FOUND ON 1184
And now I do have a question for you that if there is any logic,statement or philosphy from the Islamic studies to Eastern and Western studies that permit killing innocent people including Nimazi(prayer offerer Muslim),labourer and job oriented poor workers in revenge of the American attacks?
And if NO,then you need  hard to rectify your point of view.
People were armed, at that time their was a danger that Russia will turn toward Pakistan after Afghanistan, therefore people were armed.
Now when there is danger that America will overrun Pakistan through passage of Afghanistan of which American president had said out in his election campaign then why should we unarm these people?
Only because America or India army don't have to face any civil resistance after defeating Pakistani army?
Yes, if anyone of them is involved in any destructive actions then Pakistan should act against them.
but this is morn, that government against Lashkaray Taiba  that prove right India that Pakistan involve in that.
Najeeb Ul Rehman Saico, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
if accept that Laskaray Taiba involve that still it is wrong to blame Pakistani government.
and one question is also that this terrorist have a either get support of any Government or Indian government personal?
is terrorist only born and made in Pakistan and not made in India and rest of the countries?
as far as Laskaray Taiba has concerned they did not involve to this recent terror.
this has remember that Hafiz Saeed was the first person who called Taliban acts as 'Fitnah'.
this is my firm believe that Taliban acts was a part of American projects so that every that person and group need to clean out from the way who challenge Taliban in any manner.
even support by whole nation, take action against Lashkar due to Indian pressure indicate Zardindco frustration and butter up nature.
American said to end this campagin which start from Saudi's funding ask them godly now clean this dirt as well, which make our society polluted.
One should also protest against them that according to what ethics, America and Saudi Arabia distributed dangerous weapons and named Jihadis but in the reality spread the virus of hateful literature and culture. Due to which slaughter houses were open in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly. And tried its best that India should attack Pakistan.
This shattered the confidence of America in the area.
Although India did not even threatened nor it has the guts to.
And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of Taliban or American posts.
Thus it was proven that without the support of Pakistan and its army, America can not do anything.
Karachi is Pakistan's business and economic center and Dubai of the less privileged areas.
Hundreds of thousands do not return empty handed from here. But since the law was enforced on the western borders, Karachi has taken all the attention.
Now they are looking to kidnap this city.
For the first time Pathan's are called Pashtoons. They are made to fight by making them strangers to each other. Although the need is to be united.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speaking learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu, or its better that everybody learns English.
You must be thinking its a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
that the cause of the torture would be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir in my childhood I had actually given the same suggestion many times to my friends ,which included people from every religion and rhetoric groups, but my friend people used to laugh over these suggestions.
at that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not that live and powerful but they were boiling inside.
its hard to understand that what is happening and why?
are these the signs of the judgement day?
what are these innocent and innoxious people being killed for?
the reason is in front of everyone, ones who want to break Pakistan into pieces are active and those who do all this neither belong to any religion nor a country.
Whether it is Karachi or Bombay, our homes are burnt with their own lamps( we  have destroyed our homes ourselves)
When the government comes, they just change names of the places to build a name for themselves. Just like these days airports, roads, buildings are all named Benazir.
What has happened in Karachi, is this what Benazir means?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awaken sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
Where reaction full of patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties have taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time they have also given American planners one more chance to think.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the turmoil in Karachi and management is showing self interest.
Management can control the situation in 1 hour but it is being given wind on purpose.
Pressure of political parties on police and rangers keeps them from doing the operation.
Talks of getting united are only limited to statements, political parties should let go of their self interests and work for the interest of a common man.
These kinds of situations will happen until political pressure stays on the management. Allah keep Pakistan safe.
In my opinion, they are the biggest terrorists.
And of course there are external powers active in this. But no one knows who they are?
But what is sad the most is if this kind of situation occurred in some city of Sarhad, government would have done what not but now when it is not in Sarhad, the government is so helpless.
Government should do an operation here and save country's big and an important city.
Otherwise, Pakistan will face a big economic setback.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth being scared. On the other hand Pakistan's media's condition is even worse.
The complete truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is this that Urdu speaking people should learn Pashto or Pashto speaking people should learn Urdu or it is even better if everyone learns English.
You will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but don't you think the reason for collision is ridiculous?
that language is the reason of violence?
There was another story of cruelness recorded in Karachi, terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
Wherever one could do something, he did everything. Reports on the media are 50% of what has happened here in four days.
Stayed awake in the last four nights and still afraid.
Who evacuated hotels, killed cobblers peanut sellers.
causing depredation on Super highway and cutting off ears of the innocents are all not aware of the punishment of Allah, which will catch them one day.
In your opinion, what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
Placing in front of us the heart struck attacks of Bombay, we certainly do not have to dive to find the reasons for this disturbance in Karachi. But there is one simple and easy reason that this disturbance was the result of spilling of blood subconsciously.
It is evident that if some one will knock kneed with the father, it is not unusual for the son to get out of control.
the blood of the loyalists of Liaqat Ali Khan also belonged to the same place but to eliminate Mr. Psycho's misunderstanding I am writing this verse.
we will also repeat our elders' traditions
we made it by sacrificing lives and will save it by doing the same
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
it is very disappointing that whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
see Liaqat Ali Khan, you will will find out that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family from Karnal in Punjab.
due to his steps for the migrants, today the migrants consider him as one of them.
there is always a reaction to every action.
one can afford on oneself but.
Ejaz Aiwan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan, they did not face any reaction.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
One Muslim League N was left, even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q have made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment in the National Assembly and the Senate.
Till now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why  no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part that is they will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft, government speaker did not take any action.
MQM the government, Muslim League N in the opposition and Muslim League Q was the party who passed 17th amendment so how is it possible that these parties will be sincere in finishing the 17th amendment.
This is what is called getting credit for nothing.
People's party is already not in a hurry about finishing 17th amendment.
How can someone think of cutting their own hands?
17th amendment will not be canceled until Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of the majority in our survey and it is also true.
If 17th amendment was to be discarded then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf. Because with being the president, he is also the chairman of the People's Party.
17th amendment is valid until he is the president.
In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to bid Zardari farewell from the president house.
neither MQM wants this nor other parties.
Most elders of our family belonged to labor class.
And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.
To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.
Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.
From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.
But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.
We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.
It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God
This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.
It was only half an hour since he started working that the little boy said " Daddy, I am not born to do this"
I said that if this is true then study a lot like us and get rid of the physical labor.
The son said, "I am studying and I will get through it also but it is the work that I can not do"
Whatsoever we did that work in three hours  and came back home.
The point of saying is that if a person picks his destiny, whatever is the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving that destiny.
Here if you do not know what you have to do then God help you!
It is said that do not say bad about the dead. But what shall we do, we see only bad things in Benazir even on her first death anniversary.
Benazir, for her selfish purpose, crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs after giving the list of their names who were fighting for freedom on one hand and on the other gave India the chance to keep its full attention on Kashmir after them helping to suppress Punjab Movement.
Tug of war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history, which has pushed the country back many years.
Benazir continued to give negative comments on Kashmir and the nuclear program after being exiled.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
during her rule, Benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make as much money that is why he is known as Mr. Ten percent.
during Benazir's rule his brother got killed but his murderers are still safe from any punishment.
besides being a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
just like Benazir did her politics over her fathers dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came into power twice but she could not punish her the culprits of her father's political murder even she couldn't register a case against them.
it has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
what should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated 16th December as a didactic day and take such measures that this kind of incident don't take place again.
on this day we could send greeting to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again.
the rulers would reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Bahari's stuck in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines of life from the next day.
Only if East and West Pakistan could be one together just like East and West Germany was united once again.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be granted in the near future.
When it was announced in the news today that the Governor of the American State Illinois was arrested for corruption charges
and when the State Congress started getting ready to remove him from the position of the governor as soon as possible, then there is this one American companion who has a close watch on the circumstances of Pakistan, boastfully claimed to us that this is what we call democracy.
In America, even the higher level people can not transcendence the law.
And there is your country, whose president was made after he had the corruption charges dropped.
we felt our nerve of wit and said that what if a governor was arrested in America,in our Pakistan once our prime minister was arrested during the night and was hanged and the other time was exiled.
Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
Pakistan awarded guard of honor and bid farewell from the president house who broke the law of the country. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
Chief Justice of Pakistan was laid off in such a way that even after nations support, he has yet not reinstated. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
In Pakistan, fake degree holder was appointed as health minister, Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
After listening to this, poor American could not stop laughing and also accepted defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by Americans from all sides.
It seems from his smile
that America is with his government. But he is forgetting that last year the same people was with Parvez Musharaf.
the picture look like a picture of Family
before that no picture as such has been published in which President is with 3 American authorities
Look like that America's work has been increased in Pakistan and one and more Authorities are working on it or they might not believe that person as compared to the first one.
it might possible that they have planned also this, keeping in mind the nature of President Zardari promise fulfillment.
if there would any intelligent Politician than there would be atleast not smiling in this picture and his face should show some Embarcement
if Democracy principle applied on this picture than President Zardari is in Minority
According to Democracy, Majority is the ruler of Nation and who are they picture is showing
Heaven like Swat of Pakistan is also known as Switzerland.
till now, according to Government Policy, cross talks are also going along with the power use
but power use is resulting in increase power of Taliban and increasing sympathy for Taliban among people beside that it is not providing any benefits
what needs to be done is that the government, instead of using the power, should eliminate the causes of the issue.
by eliminating the causes Fazlullah and Taliban will automatically finish.
the Sharia bill proposed by ANP will become the solution of the problems of Swat to a great extent.
But besides implementation of the Sharia, the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues.
General Musharraf, the rights that his aches that this nation diagonal scientists have activity will be rid of the power, but those who has the intention of changing the interview with CNN
He also to the amadein
The expected actions and the steps arranged was end
When the rule of Bush  was at an end he was scared and he started dealing with theives
General Musharraf, the army had to control, but the present Government not only to what is the.
If it was Bajaur, or Swat the terror was uncontrollable by army.

I'am afraid that pakistani millitary is unable to controll a small group of taliban from entering in there country then how can they fight with india
They are unable to track the non-juduicial F.M channel which is running by taliban,according to me that is very easy.
Then also they didnt took any action against taliban's illegal F.M channel which is spreading poison all over the country or  ruining their country with the help of that channel
After closing the girls schools now they are closing the boys schools too.
They order curfew because talibans can move easily or proceed easily.
Today at night during curfew eight turcks, during curfew they entered  mangora's environ and ENTRENCHED them.
Now the question raises that after being curfewed  then how the talibans entered in .
The Army can kill Akber bagdi at his home but they given salami to taliban
For god sake can anyone make then understand that  help the helpless people of SWAT and release them from the talibans army and prove that pakistani army is strong enough to take action against any one of his enemy.
He says, maximum bloodshed has been done on the base of religion, you tell me in the absence of any religion wont bloodshed occur?
Punjabi, Pathan. white and black, Mehsud and other tribes, are all these created by religion?
No! No way! Sir, religious is what teaches that no one is black or white, punjabi or muhajir otherwise if religion was not present, then half world would have vanished for the war between white and black and other half fighting over the status and sect.
Actually, religion gives moral teachings to the man. And binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here. And he should spent his life according to his rules.
As a muslim, I have total faith that Islam is complete way of life and a true religion.
After living in London, for many years I used to ask wellness of my family over the telephone every morning. Although many did not even call once to find out how we were. Then I realized that they do not even tolerate our phone calls so we stopped calling.
Living here in France for the last two years, I have also felt the same thing.
Do not know why people expect us to call.
A resolution passed about Iraq in a few hours, Darfar has absolutely no problem in sending peace army.
Bombay attacks were condemned in no time and banning dubious groups is only a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are doing consensus.
O caretakers of international peace! life is finishing here!
Is it for real that every one is waiting for its end?
So that no other victim will even think about using a great damage causing weapon like a sling shot to fight for his rights?
Doesn't your hear ache even when a father is running holding his son's dead body?
If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
But you are a shame to the name of humanity.
At least this was proven that this area was also Israel's country for thousands of years.
What should happen is that both the nations should live together happily and with love but since they are controlled by the west and arab countries, therefore peace can not be formed here with out their consent.
But even Iran wants to fight its proxy war here now.
Even if operations in Israel are stopped for the time being, they will start again after some other incident.
The interest of BBC's country is subject to the bestowing of America and Israel. And this is the reason why in the name of "enlightenment", they have come with a series of blogs based on "darkness" and doing one-way and a blind propaganda.
BBC is just doing formality and to gain sympathy is their only purpose and wish!
mr moderator is requested that he may publish the commentry by this humble soul so that one can guess BBC still has some integrity left.
Thankyou.

At this time along with Dera Ghazi Khan, in whole country winter rains are goin on.
here is a poem according to the weather, enjoy the weather along with this poem.
These rains are with your presence.
if it rains, its spring
if it stays then its peace
sometimes comes without a reason
at times spread over day and night
sometimes very noisy and sometimes very quiet
These rains are with your presence.
in a memory, at a night
to a buried ash
Sometimes we blew out the flames.
Sometimes we burnt ourselves.
Sometimes every drop is like pain.
And these rains are only because of you.
All these things in the right to take the country, those people, or in a.

Yesterday a strange incident took place.
All together police running here and there but not ask on illegal parking
and moreover that NYPD traffic was also not in a mood to look at illegal parked cars.
it happened like this that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in Hudson river.
Till now it is just known this that "Terrorists" relation was with birds race Goose.
Yesterday was maybe New York's historic cold
Temperature do not drop to this degree
Me my own jaw is beginning to hurt after half hour of stroll outside.
Imagine that what would have happened to those people who jumped from plane in the river.
Happy news is that people all together stayed safe
and sad news is that ship of company sank in this financial crisis.
While watching all this I went to New Jersey by West Side Highway. I Noticed that South Bound is blocked, still what I did?
Yes, I was jammed in it on my way back.
Thanks God,during my an hour trip the road was bit cleared as I get an exit from 56 street.
Otherwise I did not avail the first two exit due to the long lanes of vehicles.

For no reason, we thought that the Taliban group from Sawat was non religious, who were only against women education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
But like majority of the ideas, this was not proven right also. According to this news of CNN, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a Boys school with gunpowder.
In Swat,the Taliban pulled down the school of students.
The schools of girls were pulled down first in the cause of famous English school Ladies First and I do not that the people why did not consider Talibab free of crimes.
It is also known that it is wrong that Taliban are only against the education of girls.
not this but the wonderful that they are against total education.
These freedom fighters are gifted more power and the Devil
which is commanding us and he is helped to abolish it.
Amin after it Amin.
Wonderful,120 school have been pulled down yet.
The Muslims first thing to strong tradition in the name of gather, property from the Quran, married, and the custom of his many of the girl israr eight years old and adult in and was not, to India, with the girl in the marriage, news.

From on before a dog married a girl which is also freshed
They saw the groom too
Humanity in 21st century is extinguished
it is the era of computers and its involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life.
many people have many reservation over this increasing involvement of computer, for example, in financial matters.
where use of credit card bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
so now only through your financial matters like through your credit card, you can be located.
and in future when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent, its benefits will increase more and more.
similarly in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, the credit card information is stolen.
similarly computers have become the source of friendship.
Social Networking sites like Orkut, Facebook and my space comes in first tear when compared according to popularity.
But don't u feel Psychologically  that the more we are accustoming ourselves to social networks we are physically getting away from people.
Like Match making websites which match your choices to other peoples choices to find similarities and you get a list of such matches.
Now can you spend your life with a person exactly like you ?
I can't, that's why we can compromise of a life partner who is half or partly similar to you.
So the lacking of mine can be compensated by the partner.
I guess i got a lesser part of intelligence
Since childhood when ever an elder said anything to me that was the truth for me.
This is how I got to believe that dad has the answer to every question in the world.
People used to make a lot of jokes about me on this.
But only that saying seemed true which could be possible.
Become much irritation because what was the reason to tell lie?
Bore loss on that saying even at this age
So it is my effort to say lie the very least.
Do not misguide someone by lieing and that also by attaching Allah's name.
and Allah willing say only when there is pray to Allah that work completes.
Remaining Allah knows better the state of intention.
This is a disgusting problem which is created due to reason of distance from religion.
According to law of both our Pakistan and religion, minor child should stay with mother.
Their expense is due to their father and father can meet with children.
Then when the kids get mature, they can live with anyone they want.
You have rightly said about the misunderstandings relatives create.
Our behavior is over taken by feudal thinking
Ever here this way of thinking is working that new co-sharers will be born in father's property and this is where the opposition is shown. Otherwise their father's this behavior is worth praise and pursuance.
With reference to relationships, these forceful affiliation has created evil in our society.
Concept of marriage of a divorced or a widow is ending.
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason family breakups.
In our society, if wife of a 50-55 year old man or husband of a woman goes to the next world and he marries again, why is he not respected?
There is a Pakistani uncle living close to us, his wife passed away around 10-12 years ago. Now after all his children got married, he married a widow, for which his kids have turned against him.
In my point of view, it is their religious right, what do you say?
In my opinion,being alive as her children no one can take the place of our mother we cant tolerate it..like this how many of us believe in this  type of thinking!!!
According to my thinking his sons should thik that what did he done wrong when he married with widdow after the merriage of children?
By this that widdow got a helper and he got a person to manage his home.
Because his sons and daughters engaged in their life and will not care him.
The reason behind this is ignorence.
In future what if their wives refused to work for the old man?
This is the outcome of the social pressure.
Childeren feel ashamed on the second marriage of their father when people make jokes of such family on this action.
Where as they must face the circumstances and say that what their father did,it was just according to Islam.
This is a curse in our society in which we are sunk since last 40 to 50 years.
It is acceptable for a wife that her husband does unlawful actions but she does not let him marry another woman.
If its in her power, she will not let him do so even after she dies.
Destroys her afterlife along with her husbands'.And also lets spreading of the immorality in the society.
Nothing happens with singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.
And about your question, when sir instead of bringing his wife home, goes to someone else's wife so the dependents just make a fuss for the show and stay quiet and satisfied. ( yeah, later the relatives of the wife get angry)
In the Indian subcontinent, we accepted Islam centuries ago but we could not let go of this illiterate thinking and always thought of culture and tradition as more valuable than Islam.
Considering man's 2nd marriage as ridiculous, divorce as denigration, divorced as untouchable, love marriage as dishonor and considering a man marrying an older women is dissimulation of the women is only the result of this way of thinking.
And over all, by copying the western world, we are declaring the religious and veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam was easy, getting rid of this way of thinking is very hard.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Amen
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.

Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes that i found this secret in my life that if leader of any Army is in front line then that Army will never lose.
But here situation is else.
To say that Common people are there to die for us if we die then martyr
if someone from common people dies then murder
May Allah bless and have mercy on you.
When I was coming back to the shop after Isha prayer tonight, one man who was sitting in  car, raised his hand and asked me to come.
I thought may be this man has forgotten his way or may be he wants to ask something. I stopped so his whole family was in his car.
He asked if I can understand Arabic very well or not. I said that there is no problem. You tell me what is the matter.
He started saying, I have come from Riyadh but here some one in Medina picked my pocket if you please help me. I said forget about it.Because  this has happened with me earlier also as I gave this man 20 riyals to pay for gas and go back to Riyadh but he started doing the same thing after moving forward a little.
I got really angry and when I told him and threaten him of a cop, he vanished from there.
So now this is the condition of us Muslims that even when we come to beg money, we come with families riding in cars and daily manage to get at least 2 to 3000.
Although there is an evident saying of the Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the hand above is better than the hand below and the hand above is the giving hand the lower is the taking hand.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims ( Amen)

Wife of famous singer Adnan Sami, reached a police station in Bombay accusing him of torturing her.
The police station suggester her to contact Court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Guladari submitted a plea against her husband that Adnan Sami tortures her continuously.
and treats her inhumanely.
Now this has exceeded her tolerance limit therefore a case should be recorded against Adnan Sami.
Police instead of recording a report suggested that she should contact the court by saying that this matter is not what comes under police control.
In your opinion, is the accusation of Adnan Sami's wife on him is correct?
What if this accusation is an attempt of tarnishing the name of Adnan Sami?
Let us know of your comments regarding this matter.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
as far as allegations are concerned, anyone can post it on someone else.
nothing comes before prestige.
however may be the relations between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he left his respectful life and went to India to make money and now this fame has caught him badly.
this is a consequence of his own deeds.
Washington...
top American officials say that president Obama will take strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
in the new American policy over Afghanistan, there is more emphasis on war than development.
officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achievement of American goals Since in his government, there is corruption, drugs business has increased and Taliban are regaining their power.
American officials say that people, who are putting more pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more, include vice president Joe Biden and President Obama's representative for Afhanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke.
He said that this good administration was noticed after the President Bush left, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai after every 2 weeks and used to emphasize on the role of America in Afghanistan and the development of its city departments.
Officials say that Obama management will work with the state leaders as a backup with the main government.
Officials say that they will emphasize Hamid Karzai on fighting against corruption
Hamid Karzai faces new elections this year. And it is not clear as yet that Obama and his companions will favor his presidency or not.
Is this statement, of the American officials, a forecast of change in American policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is this era of Hamid Karzai ending?
What are your thoughts in this matter?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and SriLanka, Srilanka defeated Pakistan with 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Srilanka in the first one-day match although Srilanka won in the next two matches.
In this third one-day match, the nation's team performance was very poor. They worn out in only 75 runs in 23 overs against 309 runs made by the national team of Srilanka.And this is how we faced a lesson learning defeat.
the result of the series proves that the National team has no consistency in its performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
which departments of the game should be addressed more by the authorities?
are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
which department you will hold responsible for the defeat, fielding, batting or bowling?
please provide your feedback.
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish  traditions continue. these feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule, who would call them Muslims?
a Sardar should walk himself over these embers. why the present government do not act against them?

Sir Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan for playing one day international series.
Visit of a foreign team to Pakistan, in spite of Pak India tension is a good sign.
On reaching Karachi Airport the Sir Lankan team was given a warm welcome.
Two matches will be held between Pakistan and Sir Lanka in Karachi while the third one will be played in Lahore.
Both teams are asserting highly regarding their batting, bowling and fielding.
If Siri Lanka venerates its spinners, Pakistan’s reliance is on its fast bowlers.
Sir Lanka’s captain Mahela Jayawardene says that no one player but the whole Pakistan cricket team is dangerous.
Muralidharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, while Pakistan’s captain says that this competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik has said “we have played Murali Dharan before and will take care of Mendis as well. We have made a secret game plan and will reveal it on the ground”.
Will the Pakistan and Sir Lanka series live up to claims of being interesting and thrilling?
Which side will dominate in the Pakistan and Siri Lanka series?
Who will win the series?
Who will be man of the series?

It is all these people's doing Kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years.
No, no one  asked, now they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism so they have started talking about peace and settlement.
First they generally massacred Muslims now they are perplexedly settling the matters.
In any way Pakistan has to understand their duplicitous policies.
Asad Khan London
India is creating such a situation that the world's attention can be diverted from Kashmir.
but Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now the British Government is also understanding that the Indians are taking cover from their occupation over Kashmir by blaming Pakistan of terrorism.
and they hesitate to talk to Pakistan over this issue.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that by resolving the issue of Kashmir will bring an end to extremism, the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
it should be clear that the newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister while talking to media in Mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Does India wants to use terrorism as a means to avoid a dialogue ?
Let us know about you opinion
Usman Aftab
I think it is the big powers (countries) that want to harm Pakistan.
In fact are thinking of means to control Pakistan. They know Pakistan is an atomic power.
They want to create an environment of a revolution.
Foreign counties are thinking that if Pakistan is cornered that will pose more political and geographical problems. They want to help Pakistan and want to achieve their vested interests.

Hindus always hit hard and then start speaking sweet.
I think that they get problems often in a while and they start threatning Pakistan.
We are ready from each aspect.Indian army chief should better shut his mouth up else we are capable to cross attacking.
Faheem Siddique
Raas Al Khaima, It is due to America that wrong statements are being given , America is out of its mind but now India is also doing the same, India should try attacking , then it will become crystal clear that who stands where.
Israel is attacking Hammas but nobody has that much integrity to stop them. India also want to follow Israel's foot steps
Prime Minister Syed YOusaf Raza Gillini said that the newly elected vice president Joe Biden had played an important role in steping down of previous president musharraf as army cheif and restoring crippled democracy, thats why the government of pakistan has awarded him with Sitare-e-Imtiaz (honour medal)
No political party shoud get credit of his  giving up of uniform and restoration of the democracy , Parliment is not a mere rubber stamp
All decisions will be taken in the parliment
Prime minister said that the chapter of Doctor Qadeer has been closed

This is very hurtful incident that Israel is publicly massacring the Palestinians, same situation is here in Kashmir but Security Council do not even bother by it.
As many organizations who are in Palestine and Kashmir should continue their fight till freedom and by creating unity between themselves keep fighting every kind of aggression, one of these days their Martyr will bring result. By the will of Allah
Israeli air attacks still continues in Gaza, since now several Palestinian Men, Women and children have been martyred.
Important political leader of Hamas Nazarian have been martyred with wife and kids.
There meeting of Security Council ended without any decision.
The condemning resolution presented by Libia and other Arab countries against Israel is facing American opposition in the meeting.

In my opinion, the basic fact is that most of our people are uneducated and they don't even know where their money is actually going. Government is interested in doing it's job properly by applying and collecting taxes. Shortfall of electricity and gas will continue in the same manner.
Because everyone knows about the character of those who have been elected by our own nation.
Crisis of electricity and gas all over Pakistan has become a critical state.
On the other hand the GAS tariff has been raised to 8% where as in some cities due to the non availability of the petrol is increasing the difficulties and miseries of the masses.
Due to the long load shedding of electricity and gas crisis in Pakistan's industrial and business sector, there is a severe reaction. Riots and violent protests are taking place.
Industrialist have given an ultimatum before closing the factories.
Here there is growing anxiety among those dwelling in  Karachi because of eight to ten hours electricity load shedding
Industrial activities have almost paralyzed.
Government department are playing a blame game on each other
isn't under these circumstance the proposals for increasing electricity and gas tariff a joke with the people?
Why is attention not being given in resolving the issues?
Can the government see the failing of the country's economy?
To counter these problems for the short term, what suggestions do u have?
Please inform us about your opinion.
Imran Khokar from Madina Munawara Saudi Arabia, I want to say the way the people are, they get similar leaders.
I am surprised that government carrying slogan of public service is itself hurting them.
unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a persecution.
Government has no control over the institutions.
Law and order situation is deteriorating every day, may Allah bestow his mercy on this country.

the Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The India cricket team is scheduled to play three tests, five one day and one twenty twenty match on its Pakistan tour.
Vice president of Indian cricket board Mr. Ragiv Shukla told Geo News that he has sought permission for the tour of Pakistan from Indian government but due to current tensions between the two counties the tour has been canceled.
Is the Indian Governments initiative not to allow the cricket team to visit Pakistan on grounds of political reasons justified? Can't sports be kept aside from politics?
Is the Indian Government's decision counter productive for cricket?
Despite security concerns English team visited India then why can't the Indian team continue its tour of Pakistan.

Salman from Karachi
Those people who feel proud of visiting India
and direct or produce their videos in India should open their eyes that what response India is giving.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami in which he said that he is not Pakistani national but a British.
Adnan Sami should return to Pakistan first chance he gets because respect did not suit you there either.

Indian's attitude has changed after Bombay Attacks.
Jagjit Singh has showed his reaction in this way that he hates Pakistan and Pakistani.
One should know that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsley. How is he a bad singer now? Adnan Sami Should stay in India, there is not need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshaad Alam
Karachi, On the statement of Jagjit Singh, I would only say that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Bombay incident, there hateful statements have increased. The same people are now saying evil against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
according to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said "You dog this is a farewell kiss"
after that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards Bush. president Bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself.
second shoe hit the American Flag.
Security personnels dragged the journalist away from there.
at this point, president Bush said that he didn't know why he had done so , Shoe was of number 10, I had no problem.
do you think this reaction of the journalist wasn't an expression of deprecation or President bush from the Iraqi people?
what would you say on this incident?
The tension between Pakistan and India's relations after the terrorism in Mumbai got further intense when the fighter planes from the Indian Air force violated the Pakistani airspace in Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
as a result of retaliation from Pak Air force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
sources say that both Indian planes were loaded with ammunition.
This is the first of its kind incident in the current tensed situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that Air Force is all set for country's air defense.
Information Minister Sherry Rahman says that Indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed. Although, this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
In your opinion, does India really have an intention of air strike on Pakistan?
Is this statement of India correct that this violation was a mistake or this was to find out the ability of Pakistan Air force.
Is this incident not going to aggravate the current estrangement among the two countries?

Its true that they were killed but we feel sorry that they killed many innocent people in Karachi,at which they feel proud that Naseer Ullah Baber did a good job
But later,changed at all.
But it's also true that they ignored the seniors of their party and nominated their own son as the representative of People's Party.What sort of democracy is it?
Jimmy Noor,Karachi,This news has proved Quran's statement that a non Muslim will actually help an other non Muslim.
But if the iron axe doesnt contains the handle,it can' cut any thing.
Our leaders own these styles,they are adopting secret ways,that's why our country is suffering with hardships.
May Allah Almighty show the right path to our leaders.

Why is India blaming these parties for the Bombay attacks without any proof?
Aren't there any terrorist groups in India?
Are International groups not aware of the tortures being done on the minorities in India?

Karachi, our leaders should understand this that people, they are doing the operation against, are the true valuers of Pakistan, who are tolerating all kinds of tortures but they love Pakistan.
If there would be war then they will fight for Pakistan.
When their love would be felt, just condenming politics will not work. I think between both, there might be going a resulting war.
