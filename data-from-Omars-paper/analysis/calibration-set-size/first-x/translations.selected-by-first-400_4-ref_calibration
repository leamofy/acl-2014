First nuclear test was done in 1990
Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.
In this book, called 'Nuclear Express', the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.
Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News, that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Thomas Reid said that due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Among the factors are the design of the bomb, and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.
He further added that that was the reason that Pakistan was able to reply to India's Nuclear test with a nuclear test in just 2 weeks and 3 days.
Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961, Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test, in response to which America took 17 days to preform a test, despite having this bomb for a long time.
He added that the atom bomb that was tested on May 19th 1998 by Pakistan was made very carefully and that Pakistani scientists had complete reliance on it.
When Thomas Reid was asked whether China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said because India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.
He said that there was proof available that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and later on the documents which were received from Libya also verify this fact.
Upon another question, as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.
He said that we also believe that Israel also has access to the results of this testing.
Thomas Reid was also asked about China's nuclear distribution program which is going on.
Upon that Thomas Reid said that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Asfahan, Iran since 1991.
Apart from this, China provided Iran with the nuclear enrichment plant in Kheraj.
He said that China has been providing Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt and Libya with nuclear technology through North Korea.

Protest against the removal of journalists
On Tuesday the organization of journalists, RIUJ held protests in front of the Islamabad Press Club of journalists and newspaper workers against media owners and the government about the news channel and newspapers removing many of their employees.
Speaking to the protesters, senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, Federal Union of Journalists,  C.R. Shamsi said that the politicians who used to protest with us till yesterday on the streets, today they have become rulers and are sitting in the parliament. Fearing a certain lobby of the media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of the journalists.
He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of Rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.
An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.
He said that there should be firm steps taken against the TV and newspaper owners, and the journalists should put a protest camp in front of the parliament to get their rights.
C.R. Shamsi criticized the governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, saying that employees were removed from his Urdu Newspaper 'Aaj Kal' staff, without prior notice.

Speaking to the protestors, the General Secretary of PUFJ said that today, throughout the country, journalist organizations are observing a black day against the removal of journalists and newspaper workers, whereas journalists will go to the parliamentary session wearing black bands on their arms to get back their rights.
According to Mazhar Abbas, in 50% of the Pakistani newspapers and TV channels the workers and journalists were being exploited, where they work without any agreement.
He said that till now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been removed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is being feared that the owners will remove hundreds more in the present year, making an excuse of the present financial crisis.
Mazhar Abbas said that the journalist movement will continue, until removed employees are not reinstated, the newspaper workers wages fixed by the seventh Wage board award is not enforced, and the salaries for many months payable to TV channels and newspaper workers is not paid.

It was the saying of the Republican parties, that this economic plan was very expensive and that it would not be successful.
Among the representatives of the houses, 240 votes were given in favor of the plan, while 188 votes were given against it.
This economic reform plan has to be produced in the Senate next week, where the ruling Democratic party has a very normal majority.
It is being feared that due to opposition from the republican party, it's passing in the senate may not be easy.
After the passing of the economic reform plan among the representatives of the houses, Barack Obama said to the members, forcing them, that they should not let political differences get in the way of this important plan.
The President said that plan, which he hoped would become law by next month would prove helpful in creating a suitable environment in the country, because of which business would prosper in the country.
According to this plan, the common man and the businessmen would be relieved of 275 trillion Dollars of debt, and 540 trillion Dollars would be given for fixing roads, bridges and ten thousand schools and for unemployment allowance and research on new technology.

The Republican party members, among the representatives of the senate, called the proposed bill a waste of government money, and they said that it will not help in creating new employment opportunities.
They stressed upon the bill passed by their party, in which more importance was given to tax cuts.
They said that more employment opportunities could be formed with less capital through their bill.
They said that compared to constructive plans, more employment opportunities could be formed through tax cuts.
Bitterness between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Israeli president, almost screaming, that the blood of many humans were spilled in Gaza, and it saddened him to see that people could watch this armed killing from Israel and clap in agreement.
Mr. Erdogan said that "I believe that you are using such words to erase your guilty feeling, and outloud, that too. But you killed those people, and I am remembering those children who were killed near the shore."
Simon said that Gaza's calamity is not Israel, but Hamas, who have established a dangerous dictatorship over there.
A BBC journalist from Davos said that he had never seen such a scene in an global economic forum before.
However, Erdogan later stated that he respected the Israeli president and his age, which is why he did not scream at him, but whatever he was saying was very far from the truth
Turkey is one of the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, but for the last few years there has been tension between them.
The attacks were not planned in Pakistan.
Speaking to Indian news channel, NDTV, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said that the report of the Pakistani investigations into the Mumbai blast will be prepared soon.
In the attacks that took place in Mumbai, last Novemeber, more than 170 persons were killed.
India claims that the responsibility for the attacks belongs to the extremist group, Lashkar-e-Taiba.
India also said that Pakistani 'state factors' were guilty in the Mumbai attacks.
After the Mumbai attacks, the relations between the two countries were affected.
The high commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan gave his first statement about the report of the Pakistani investigations, from which it becomes evident as to what is within the report.
Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that as far as investigation has gone, Pakistani land has not been used.
It must be some other place, not England either.
These were the two places (Pakistan and Britain), about which I was in doubt.
India and the global brotherhood has put considerable pressure on Pakistan, to take action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan says that it has arrested dozens of people during the action against groups which were clearly involved in the Mumbai attacks.
Wahid Shamsul Hasan said: We are not trying to cover this up.
We believe in acting upon facts.
Our investigations will be accepted by the world.
We will try to satisfy India with the results (of the investigation).
Defending the delay in the Pakistani investigations, he said that to gather, understand and verify such matter takes time.
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that India took 45 days to hand over its dossier.
Black person chosen as Republican leader as well.
In the sixth round of elections of the Republican party, Michael Steele,who got 91 votes out of 168, won.
In the selection for the post of Chairman, the candidate opposing Steele, Katon Dawson got 77 votes, whereas the ex-Chairman Duncan withdrew from the competition in the second stage.
Newspaper writers say that among the five candidates who stood for the chairmanship of the Republican Party, Michael Steele was considered the most moderate leader.
After winning, Michael Steele said in his speech, 'We are going to tell our friends and foes together, that you can join with us, but whoever wants to spoil this, they should be ready to be separated from us'. Michael Steele is from Maryland, where he was Deputy Governor.
He rose to fame in 2006, when he stood in the voting for a seat of the senate.
But after losing in the voting for the senate seat, he became the chairman of the Political Conservative Committee of the party.
Now, after being selected the chairman of the party, the country wide projects of the party will be under his supervision.

The Indian claim of the presence of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaysh-e-Mohammad in Jammu
There are reports of the presence of militants in the Ponch province of Jammu
According to government sources, upon receiving secret reports, the police and the army have surrounded the region and have started searching.
In this period small fights ensued in which four militants, two soldiers and one police agent were killed.
According to sources these fights were going on until the last reports received, and Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad militants are present in these regions, to fight with whom more army battalions were sent there.
Meanwhile, the chief minister selected by the joint government, Umar Abdullah met the governor and informed him about his being selected the leader of his party, the National Conference in the assembly.
The allied party of the National Conference, the Congress also informed the governor of their support for Umar Abdullah.
Umar Abdullah will be administered the oath as the chief minister of the state tomorrow.
Note that in the recently held state elections, the National Conference got 28 out of the 87 seats of the parliament, coming forth the biggest party. It should be clear that separatist groups boycotted the elections.
Congress, which got 17 seats, was prepared to form a joint government with the National Conference.
Today, upon reaching Srinagar, Umar Abdullah was jubilantly greeted by the party members.
On this occasion, Umar Abdullah said that he would try to play a role in generating dialog between the Indian government and separatists. However, this would not be possible until the elections took place and the new government came to power in India.
The role of the European Union in peace making in the Middle East.
If looked at from a government perspective, of the diplomatic efforts going on to stop the Middle East war, those of the European Union are the most decisive.
According to the state policy of Brussels, the efforts of the Shwarzenburg delegation or those of Sarkozy, is similar to giving a helping hand.
The spokesperson of the European Commission, Amadeu Altafaj, said that every effort which helps advancing the joint message of the European Union to the two parties, is welcome.
As far as the state policy is concerned, everyone seems alright.
However, in reality, the European Union is in a sad state of internal differences from the inside.
As the president of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is weak, to start with.
On top of that, internal fighting has made it all the more helpless.
On the other hand, French President, Sarkozy's demeanor is such that one would think that he was the president of the Union.
Though France has completed it's 6 month presidency period.
Sarkozy wants to play a presidential role, and he is able to, but he does not have the permission to do so.
The most ridiculous situation faces the foreign minister of France, Bernard Kouchner.
He is part of the delegation, which is being headed by Schwarzenberg, the foreign minister of Czech Republic.
What is even worse is that both the foreign ministers are giving different statements on the middle east war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself whereas according to Kouchner this war does not come under defense policy. On the other side, Germany has also sent its special ambassador to Middle East. European Union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues.
Its evidence is the reaction of Israel who does not pay an importance to the conciliation efforts of the EU.
EU has a golden chance of getting something done. Because America has lost in the Middle East due to the policies of George Bush.
Economic setback: Suicide of German billionaire industrialist.
Adolf Meerklay, residing in the area of Sawabia in southern Germany, has though left a great business group behind him.
But earlier common German citizens did not know much about him.
Later when he had to conference, about the loan given to his industrial group, with almost 30 banks for many weeks, he also became topic of the headlines. And he could see a dark future of Meerklay groups.
The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 to one Billion Euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle went into deep pressure.
Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had got to this position from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic powet.
After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quick, putting it on new lines.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm, Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have sanctioned 400 million Euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.
Like this, after the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain the same as it was.
Crime rate among the immigrants in Germany.
According to the fresh statistics, crime rate among the immigrants from 2004 to 2007 is
Reduced from 9.22%
to 4.21%
According to Joachim Herrmann, the interior minister of Baweria province, this is apparently a positive change.
He said: "It is important to note that the number of foreigners getting German citizenship is increasing.
Therefore this should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German but his background is foreign.
Herrmann said that his province will take this in to account when gathering statistics in 2010.
Besides Baweria, Hamburg is also thinking in the same lines.
The internal affairs senator related with the matters of CDU, Cristoph said: "When research is done in a scientific manner, Ahlhaus, man can not bring about its required results as it wills, but rather, it depends on the numbers and statistics that come out from the research.
He referred to a crime prevention state wise objective report, Ahlhaus, which was prepared in 2006, and on the face of which he researched this. It was reported as to what percent of the people committing crime from Bergdorf to Hamburg were foreigners.
From the results, it became clear that the foreigners there
had a lower crime percentage than the crimes taking place in the whole state.
Contrary to this, during 2006, when the percentage of youngsters committing crimes was calculated, it became evident that the youngsters from a foreign background committing crime was 44
.7 percent.
However, the various German political parties such as SPD, environmentalist party, grains, and left wing party Linkspartei is against finding out during the collecting of crime statistics, as to which German citizen is of foreign background.

The same man is introducing himself as the Father of Talha and is talking in German language.
Arabic subtitles are also present in this video message.
There is a log of Al-Qaeda on the side of the screen and video has the date of October 2008.
In this message, it is said to the German Government that is the country expressing their belief that they will not be attacked on after assigning army in a great number in Afghanistan. If this is not innocence, what is it?
This man calling himself "Father of Talha" did not threaten about attack on Germany indirectly.
In Afghanistan, the number of German army soldiers included in the United army NATO is almost 3500 at this time.
In October last year, German Parliament has approved of sending 1000 more soldiers to Afghanistan.
This is the first message received by Germany from Al-Qaeda.
Mikhael Luders, who keeps a close watch on the activities related to terrorism, says in relation to this message :" The suicide bombing outside German consulate recently has proved that we should take it seriously in every condition.
For the last few years, AL-Qaeda has been distributing messages over the internet and there have been attacks after such messages.
On Saturday,the militant organisation, Taliban took responsibility for the suicide attacks that took place outside the German embassy.
Many German newspapers and thinkers are looking at this attack in connection with the Al-Qaidah message.
"They are targeting Germany"
Fundamentalist Muslims are viewing the German Afghan policy in a negative and critical manner.
They accuse the German government of following an extremist policy, not only in Afghanistan, but also in the Middle East.
Because of this, they are considering German as their target, more and more.
In the meantime, the German government claims that the German secret agencies had knowledge about this video, even before it came to light.
The German joint crime control organisation is busy studying the video.
Obama has taken the position of American presidency.
In this setup, let alone the American public, the whole world has different hopes about Obama.
Now that Barack Obama is receiving congratulatory messages from around the world on becoming president, the expectations from him are also becoming clear.
In these regards, German Chancellor, Angela Merchel also expressed reliance on the new American President.
"I believe that the Joint Republic of Germany and the United States of America will be able to get together on the basis of strong relationships and partnership, to solve the problems facing us".
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that Obama seems a serious and open hearted person, and this is definitely something good.
As such, the previous American president's policies were subject to criticism.
However, his government is definitely credited with arousing China into playing a more constructive role on the international level, whereas, with regards to the new president, China has said that he will have to work for strong military ties between the countries.
Expert on Chinese politics, who is active in Bokhum, Germany, Gosuwe Hu, says:
From this viewpoint, I am certain that Obama and his economic team will, within the coming weeks and months, pressurize the Beijing government into pegging the Chinese currency to a stable and market representing exchange rate.
The previous American government also increased ties with India.
About where Obama might take those ties, Professor Christopher Raj, expert on American sciences in New Delhi, says that we are now closer to a strategic partnership, but Obama cannot make any change overnight.
In a message sent to Obama by Pope Benedict, he also stressed upon the need to create an environment of peace and mutual help in the world.

Today, the always ready to die, Mujahids of Ajeen province have defeated the Israeli army, with the power of faith and martyrdom, and a show of amazing forbearance and steadfastness, tightening the collar of life, around the necks of the Zionist enemies.
If it were not for the deception of Egyptian president, Hasani (not) Mubarak, the brave and loyal Hamas Mujahids would have defeated Israel a long while ago, but apart from the Israeli siege, the Egyptians have also placed Palestinian Muslima under siege, which is the saddest story of Arab history.
Here, the Saudi Arabian and Jordanian governments are giving the Israeli government political and economic support, and are helping Israel by deceiving the helpless Muslims of Gaza.

The incapable and despicable president of the United States said that Hamas should not be given weapons either, while America is providing Israel the worlds most destructive weapons. Israel is using American weapons to massacre Palestinians and Bush also praised the Israel supporting Arabs, calling them the friends of Israel.

President Ahmadinejad said, expressing surprise over the Arab countries and their leaders silence over the beastly acts of Israel, that Israel is subjecting the Palestinian public to a holocaust.

Ahmadinejad: The king of Saudi Arabia clarify his position on the massacre in Gaza by Israel.
According to a report by Mehr news agency, the President Mahmood Ahmadinejad has told the Saudi Arabian Muslim ruler, King Abdullah, that his silence upon the human massacre in Gaza and not protesting against the killing of innocent children and women in Gaza has become a means of encouragement for the enemies of Islam.
President Ahmedinejad said in his address, that you must clarify your position and support the oppressed openly, so that the efforts of the enemies, to cause differences in the Muslim platform may be unsuccessful.
President Ahmedinejad said in his address, that you know that the human atrocities that Israel is unrelentingly carrying out in Gaza for the last 19 days in which innocent children are being killed, and houses, mosques, schools and hospitals are being bombed in a beastly manner, and the Zionist government is massacring the helpless Muslims in Gaza. In such a situation, if leaders of your caliber remain quiet, it will be a sort of an encouragement for the Israeli leaders.

The American President ignored the hurts and suffering of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, and defended his policies saying that America is still the biggest supporter country of independence. However commentators do not accept the reality of the unpopular president's remarks, as America is neither a supporter of freedom, nor a supporter of human rights, but rather it is the most mischievous country in the world, which not only supports a blood thirsty country like Israel, but is also directly involved in its crimes.
Israel, openly kills children, women and civilians and the American president is congratulating them. This is the American humanity and freedom which the world is seeing in Gaza and other places.
Usama Hamdan: Presence of army in Palestine continues
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, the Hamas leader in Lebanon, Usamah Hamdan told French News Agency, during an interview, that the one sided ceasefire from Israels side is against the comprehensive international efforts for a ceasefire. He said that as long as Israel is present in Gaza, a one sided ceasefire is meaningless.
He said that the one sided ceasefire was an unsuccessful effort of Israel to escape defeat. Hamdan said that if Israel wants long term peace, it will have to accept Hamas's conditions as well as end this siege.

Tea: an effective cure for breast cancer
According to a new research, three cups of tea a day,
if taken, can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age, by more than a third.
In a research carried out by the Moffitt Cancer Institute, in the American state of Florida, it was revealed that the risk of occurrence of breast cancer tumors, in such women below the age of 50 years
who drink at least three cups of tea a day, is reduced by up to 37%.
It was also revealed in the research that there was no significant benefit, in these regards, in the woman aged above 50, who drank three or more cups of tea a day.
Experts believe that the reason for this is that tea has such ingredients in it, which are more effective against specific tumors which generally occur in women below the age of 50.
In Moffitt Cancer Center, in the city of Tampa, Florida state, a research was conducted on over 5000 women, who had undergone treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles with women who were safe from breast cancer.
The experts also found out that on a specific type of cancer called lobular cancer, the drinking of tea has shown clear effects, and has decreased its occurrence by 66 percent.
A tenth of every breast cancer patient suffers this type of cancer.
This type of cancer is more dangerous because it is deeper and is usually only known after it spreads quite a bit.
Experts say that regular tea consumption, at least three cups a day, can drastically reduce the occurrence of breast cancer in young women.
They say that making tea a regular beverage taken on a daily basis and included in ones daily activities causes the suitable defense required against cancer in the body.
In Britain, every year, approximately 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer.

why reduce exercise with the age?
new research
exercise at any age is good for health.
it energizes your heart, reduces the cholesterol level, helps in keeping the weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer or dementia.
unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.
experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.
Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.
She lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.
The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart.
In which the pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.
The experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood.
They learnt that as people grew old, there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.
Dr. Patricia says that as age increases, the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear, and this affects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garwin  Cain was also a part of this study.
He says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this. And this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.
If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart, they can achieve the benefits of excercise, despite the increase in age.
A detailed report of this has been published in the magazine of the American Medical Association.
There are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief.
The chief of the Indian Army, General Deepak Kapoor has stated that there are no chances of immediate war with Pakistan. However, to serve the country and protect its interests, they are always ready.
General Kapoor has made the accusation, that despite ascertainments and the international pressure on Pakistan due to the Mumbai attacks, in his words, the terrorists structure is not only just the same in Pakistan, but it is also active.
He said this in an interview to journalists in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day trip to the Kashmir valley to inspect the situation of the overall security situation in Kashmir, which is under New Delhi's management and to check the preparations of the armed forces at the border.
He was asked as to what his reaction was to the media reports which state that Pakistan refuted the proof presented by India, about the Mumbai attacks.
He stated that the matters of peace and war are decided by the political leadership.
Mentioning the proven presence of a terrorism structure in Pakistan, he said that the Indian army would face such groups which are trying to disturb peace and are bent upon weakening India.
He said that in Indian Kashmir, at least 700 to 800 militants are present, of which approximately half are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that with an improvement in the seasonal weather, there might be an increase in infiltration from Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. However, India has increased the guard at the borders.
He refuted the possibility of decrease in the army posting in Kashmir, saying that there can be no compromise with regards to national security.
May Allah bless the tongues of the world and may Barack become a blessing for the world.
Though it was not expected, still we shall see how this change  will work out in our favor with regards to Pak-American relations.
And what Barack Obama, who is the result of Martin Luther Kings dreams, gives to the world.
Obama, part of whose name is Husain, taking the oath today, as the American President, is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance, but also a historic test.
Not only for himself, but also for all the people who supported him.
It will even be a test for the white majority, as for them to accept from their hearts, a black governing over them is no easy task.
Those here in South Asia, especially the Muslims, who have hopes about him, should remember that he was elected the president of America, and Obama should remember that the president of America is actually the president of the world.
A little while from then, a person whose real brothers were brought to America from their own countries, wearing the neckband of slavery,and whose blood and sweat watered the roots of the strongest country of the new era, today the a representative of that very same targeted lineage will be called the 44th President.
Many people have many expectations from this man.
It is necessary for those who admire him that they do not make unrealistic expectations about him.
If Obama is even successful in somewhat reducing the hate that is spread on lineage and religion based lines, it will be a victory for his admirers.
What effect will this change have on South Asia, and what considerable change can be expected in the American policy in this regards?
How will these changes affect Pakistani-American relations?
?
My Sir, whether it be Obama or someone else, the type of policies with regards to the whole world is decided by the multi-billionaire, influential, strong Jewish lobby.
As for Pakistan, with regards to the recent Mumbai blasts, the injurious actions taken by India, Israel and America has been seen by the whole world.
Even for a while, after Pakistan was formed, the managing of Swat was left to the Ruler of Swat, which had it's own army and law.
They surrendered their rule to the government of Pakistan according to a treaty.
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a step mother.
There has been no increase in the number of schools in Swat, since the rule of the Ruler of Swat was finished.
Nor was there any interest in the construction and development over there.
The number of girls receiving education in the present rule is many times less than their number in the previous rule.
In the Sarhad state of Pakistan, the local Taliban have been targeting the educational institutions.
The most schools were destroyed in Swat province, of which the majority were girls schools.
Not only this, but the Taliban have announced the prohibition of girls education in Swat.
Thousands of boy and girl students are being deprived of education.
What do you think the Taliban have to gain by eradicating female education?
Why has the government been unsuccessful in stopping these illegal steps?
What do you think the government should do?
The question should be, what does the ISI and Pakistani agencies get?
Because the public of Swat have realized this was a game, and that the army was there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them. Otherwise, how could five schools be blown up in a single curfew night? How could people be slaughtered during curfew and hung in the main circle of the town?
When the government is not being allowed to have any say in Swat, how can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps?
Now, the question arises, as to when the government has an armed military, new and dangerous weapons, new technology and spy system etc., then why are these four Taliban not being controlled?
The answer to this is that they have the hand of a hidden guide on their heads, because of which neither do their weapons get exhausted, nor do they get captured.
The conclusion is that the Taliban, through there dark activities is making the work of the global leadership easier.
15 years ago, the war was on in Afghanistan.
ISI used to control the Taliban when there was the opposition from the Northern Alliance, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then, suddenly the situation changed and Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of Dollars from America, so the previous friend became an enemy.
Now the situation has changed but the war is still going on and those supporting them in Pakistan are still Russia, India and Iran.
Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.
For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play Holi with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings
The question is that, is war, armed resistance and terrorism the solution to problems?
If not, then what is the magic recipe that will bring out a solution to the problems?
This is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but rather it puts 'blessings' in them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development, that Nelson Mandela had used in South Africa.
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
From the Kashmiris taking part in the elections, it looks as if they have accepted this view point.
It is the third week of Israeli attacks on Gaza and the number of deaths have gone close to a thousand.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date, a ceasefire was not possible.
According to another report, since the start of attacks, on the 27th of December, 90,000 Palestinians have left their homes and moved towards safer locations.
Here, aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, and said that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victim of grave psychological and emotional difficulties.
What do you say?
What should happen?
How is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Give Taliban a Chance.
Basit, Peshawar
Wake up! If Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down girls schools?
And kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
These Taliban has damaged Islam so much that no other nation or religion has done.
Pushtun force
Kohat, Pakistan
If the entire Muslim world gets together and even just warns Israel of attacking it, you will see how much Israel's daddy, America will get hurt.
And not only will their be immediate talks of ceasefire, there will also be an actual ceasefire.
But what can be done, where can our leaders get so much courage from?
Someone should tell Ahmedinejad that he should take the lead, as BBC forum's are full of discussion of your braveness.
The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights falls not only upon the Arabs, or the Muslims of the world, but rather it is the duty of all the nations in the world that they speak up against oppression.
This troubling incident is one of the worst misdeeds of Bush yet.
Similar to how, in Pakistan and India, on the 30th of June, that is before the close of the financial year, the government institutions are looted, in the same way, before the winding up of the American government, Israel was given the green signal to do whatever it wants.
On one hand, America says that it will try for a ceasefire.
On the other hand, the United Nations is passing resolution after resolution, but action-wise, neither have done anything. There is only one meaning of this, and that is that the even the United Nations is openly in favor of destroying the Muslims.
All Muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the United Nations, and should establish their own global organisation.
We have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations are seen, but the harm is only done to the Muslims.
What is the use of these vain efforts if BBC does not want to publish anything?
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically of Muslims, is spilled, the monster of unbiasedness gets onto BBC's back.
which considers itself the standard bearer of truth.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments
from Muslims
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, and the likes of you stay among Muslims, call yourselves Muslims and cause Muslims..
[syja786]
For a while, BBC forums have been making a certain point, sometimes while discussing suicide attacks and other times, terrorism in India.
The most used word in these anti-Islamic comments is extremism.
But, who is extremist, that you can easily figure out from the above comment.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal can not be fought with the sword?
Looking at the helpless people facing the Israel bombings, if the heart does not cry tears of blood what coes it do?
But the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that we try to use the name of Jihad to disfigure the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existece of Israel, then what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks.
The conduct of both sides is misanthropist.
The action of the United Nations and the United States seem to be supporting the Israeli wrongdoings.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
And we should think about giving the real terrorists an anti-terrorism Nobel prize for their painstaking efforts against terrorism, as after all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, would it be possible for terrorism to take place at such a large scale without the support of some big leader? And everyone knows who is controlling the strings.
In easy words, such gangsters are told to do whatever they want.
What a forceful act, hit on the head, and do not allow to cry.
The medicines for the injured, the shroud and compensation for  the dead are being given by the Arab rulers, and the question is,
Israeli attacks, what should happen?
The actual problem is that the leaders of all the Muslim countries, including the Saudi king are in a deep sleep. They neither have an army nor any protective plans. They think they can support and fulfill their responsibility.
They should take immediate action against Israel.
such as stopping the sale of petrol to Europe and America, but unfortunately..
Salams to all sisters and brothers.
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is similar to considering them defeated.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature, as the steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Israel and Hamas should enter a truce so that the death and destruction can come to an end.
Mohammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France
Absolutely correctly stated
Supposing that Hamas is 100% on the truth, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah. Even then, they should know that if a good deed is resulting in the destruction of an established house, it is no more a good deed.
Those who claim to love God, love the messenger and love their religion, loving mankind is a part of their faith.
As if it is the order of Allah to evacuate all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than the Muslims.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
No, not to kill them, but rather the order is to invite them to Islam.
But those people who plan against the religion, there is the order to perform Jihad against them.
To fight them until they stop their plans, but this does definitely not mean that you wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the end result of killing innocent children is destruction.
But I would like to tell my friends that yesterday the Israelis did not have any place for shelter, but today they have become so strong that they do not listen to anyone. This is because the Jews are one.
They do not have Shia, Sunni. They are all just Jews, and they have made everything for development.
On the other hand, what is the state of the 55 Islamic countries?
They are behind in every field, and now the situation is that they have become so helpless that the enemy is killing them and they are waiting to die.
The need is for all the Muslim countries to get togetherand prepare an action plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better action plan than this, to accept Israel and to learn modern science and developmental ways from it, and allow the world to live in peace and calm.
Muslims have a lot of land and resources.
The need is for proper utilisation.
First, the part that hurts the most is that there could not be unity between Hamas and Al-Fath.
Great leader like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were systematically killed to weaken the brave nation of the only region which is still fighting for Masjid Aqsa, and this was not possible as long as Yasin and Arafat were in the way.
The world is watching how Palestine is getting scattered, second by second, after the death of these two leaders.
And how the Jewish lobby is increasing its reach, second by second.
In 1974, Pakistan had a Prime Minister of such global credentials that for the first time in the history of the country, he gathered all the Muslims leaders, with a 100% attendance, under a single roof.
Today on his 81st birth anniversary, is it a very difficult task for the people to pledge to keep unity, not only within their ranks,
Rather the incomplete mission (of forming a joint Islamic nation) will be advanced while still removing the differences between the Muslims?
This is a Jinn, which has entered Palestine for half a century.
That Jinn has many mouths.
Many a times, this Jinn calls itself bad names from one of its other mouths to divert the attention and reduce the pressure of the world from it.
It is another mouth of this Jinn whichis eating people in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This Jinn fears Islam the most, as it knows that whenever it is removed, only Islam, Mulsims and the complete religion of Islam being followed practically, in its followers can remove it, as history proves that Islam has brought many Abu Jahls to the path.
The series of bombings of Gaza by Israeli war planes and missile strikes has been going on since the 27th of December.
More than three hundred Israeli citizens have died so far in these attacks.
Now, after the air strikes, Israeli tanks have reached the Gaza border, completely prepared to launch a land offensive.
The Security Council of the United Nations, through an agreed upon resolution passed in an emergency meeting, have demanded that Israeli and Palestinian authorities stop extremist activities immediately.
However, Israeli officials claim that they will continue their action in Gaza until they are convinced that Israel will be safe from rocket attacks.
In your opinion, is the statement by Israel, that this is an Israeli struggle for safety, acceptable?
In this situation, is the global brotherhood doing its job?
Can this inhumane action have a direct relation with the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can there be any expectation of improvement in the Middle East situation, after newly elected president Barack Obama takes office?

Palestine is a holy land for the Muslims, all over the world, and protecting it is a necessary duty for us.
We should also remember that it was our first Qiblah.
And Israel, America and India have to disappear one day, as they are made only to be destroyed, and Allah will definitely destroy the disbelievers. Sajid Sadiq, Lahore.
"When has the night of loneliness been spent shedding tears,
When has a calamity been averted only by supplication" (Nawab Zadah Nasrullah Khan)
BBC searches for such comments and publishes them.
After all it has to keep up the flag and perception of non-alignment.
As such, the news on BBC is usually true, but the main thing is the tone.
Which thing should be highlighted and which piece of news should be given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
In this practice, our Pakistani Wire-net media, in particular some columnists and newspapers are not far behind any more, as they are writing with courage against the growing extremism and terrorism and stressing a lot upon 'Muawiyah hate'.
He said that the United Nations which speaks of human rights and peace, but though the Muslims ar being oppressed greatly, you hear them say that until Hamas does not stop it's attacks, this unfair policy will continue.
Why is so much oppression being done on the Muslims? If people such as America stop supporting these Jews, then Allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support, and then see what kind of life they get.
The famous just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.
In the words of a poet
Oppression is oppression, that the more it's done the more it is erased.
Blood is blood, that the more it falls, the more it gathers.
Now who can tell who did terrorism?
Is all this not included in terrorism? Why does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocent not red?
And why is there no one to send a mourning message from anywhere?
I watched the progress of the Mumbai incident, as if my own house was on fire. The sorrow of humans can not be watched, and who can not see this sorrow? If only Muslims would think a bit, together.
How can words derogate the bodies strewn on the streets, helpless innocent faced people, injured and soaked in blood?
I feel like crying about the helplessness of Muslims, that on one side, people are dying in India, and the whole world is climbing onto Pakistan, without any proof and saying, take action or else we will.
And on the other side, Israel is ruthlessly killing Muslims and the whole world is silent. This is unbearable.
There is delay, but no darkness, with God. That too, when this darkness comes to pass.
Danger to Israel, with America present, is a joke.
As for elections, there is no doubt, to gain public support, such actions will have to be taken for the sake of power, especially in a state like Israel. As for Barack Obama, history is witness that no American ruler has been able to go against the American policy and nor will they go. Whether the ruler is white or black, he is still a ruler.
From the discussions going on in the forum, it seems that everyone is hurt over her death, but as a politician, her mistakes have not been ignored.
This issue is debatable, as to whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was dearer, why did she leave the republic for ten years in the control of Musharraf, waiting for American clearance and deal?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the stratocracised public needed her, unfortunately she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised.
when each and every historic personality is being accused, there is no one to say any thing over this.
Sana Khan
few things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done of them.
another reader.
Sir/Sir probably you should not only study Pakistan's history but that of 4 friend and 7 other countries, may be you would agree with Psycho's point of view.
Tariq Ayaz
'those who don't have a good nature can't be corrected through training'
living green in the water made the reflection of the wheat plant look like a cypress.
Britain never let them unite and established the Hindu-Muslim conflict which was later on brought up by Sir Syed.
Psycho
How merciless is our nation. We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.
We have succeeded a lot!
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar if you en wreathe him with books.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks but Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.
If they talk about war then both the sides will suffer human loss.
India says that Pakistani citizen is caught in Bombay attacks. And he has written and sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. But earlier, when India caught this extremist, said that he is a smart engineer but later they declared him to have studied only four grades. This is what has to be considered.
First of all, merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and  all christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
We do not want the flames of war, we want the flowers of peace.
War is in itself, a problem.
What problems can war solve?
It will give fire and blood today.
It will give hunger and need tomorrow.
Therefore, O intelligent people,
If war keeps getting postponed, it's better.
In your and our porch,
If the candle keeps burning, it's better.
Indo-American relations have now gotten quite deep, and India knows with certainty, that America will openly betray Pakistan, when the time comes.
This is that old history of America.
Because in the case of an Indian attack, America's goals will also be fulfilled and the expenses will be India's.
Pakistan should clearly announce that it will not start, but if injury is caused, there will be no talks of peace or truce, and the war will not stop until India is completely destroyed or captured, even if it involves our destroying ourselves.
This is Islamic history.
Before the resolution, the message that had to be given by the public and the army was given.
In compensation for the Mumbai attacks, the abnormal diplomatic and military benefits that India tried to gain, made it more a victimizing party, than a victim. That is why, in contrast to the harsh initial global reactions, the world has now reduced their force on Pakistan.
The satisfaction expressed by the United Nations over Pakistani efforts and the praise by the Interpol leader of Pakistani efforts, in disregard of India's commotion, shows the side effect of India's more than necessary diplomatics.
There is no two opinions about this being a very beastly action.
But the question is, that when thousands of Taliban were attacking Pir Samiullah's town, where was the Pakistani Army, and what were they doing?
Should the army not be taken into account, as to what they did there for one year?
Every day, how many Taliban die due to the firing of the thousands of mortar and canon shells they fire?
I appeal to the ICI that they stop their guardianship of the Taliban, for Gods sake, and let us live peacefully in paradise like Swat.
And they stop this fixed operation.
The day is not far, when a resolution will be passed in the United Nations, against army intervention in Pakistan, in the same way as it was passed against Jama'athud-Da'wah.
Riyaz Ahmad Farooqi
First of all, our radicalism and our protecting them, is alone, sufficient to provide complete proof and permissibility for action against us. And the very day such a resolution is passed, there is all probability that no voice will be raised in our support, in the United Nations.
And supposing the passing of such a resolution is delayed,some other strength will definitely leave our aid to ourself,, keeping the example of America in front of them.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
As the bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They command even after they die.
But there is an international game being played over here. Here, they are ruling by scaring the public about beastliness and terror.
So that it would be permissible for them, saying that if we are not there, beasts and wild people will come and capture the government.
Such actions of the so called Islam lovers, in the name of religion is extremely disagreeable.
The supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of America, but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions, give it the name of tribal traditions, and clearly avoid it.
Any person with a heart can never accept these beastly actions, which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of Islam.
I think the people of our army have joint these people.
This is because, when these people move around, at least some time will be taken. To catch them will only take so much time. But, forget about getting to that spot, even if they were there, they escape from there.
Are these people so brave that they take 50 or 70 people hostage and our army watches like an audience, with hand on hand.
They are also servants of Allah and so is the army.
It is clear that something is sinister.
Malaiyat. In the dictator of the age, Ziya-ul-Haqq's dictatorship, instead of presenting the Noble and Merciful characters of God, an atmosphere of religio-phobia was created by the use of many types of narrations of punishments and incidents apart from the incident of the body hanging. Even the literature and books like 'what will happen when we die?' created fear and terror.
And these people are only using this fear as a tool or a weapon to gain worldly pleasures and honor.
preachers!
As you have preached against the fire of Hell
that you have yourself become the face of fear.
It is surprising when it is said that this can not be a work of a Muslim
We are either unaware of our own history, or we ignore it for some reason.
Upon the death of the Prophet, upon refusing to pledge alliegance, who burnt the door of the daughter of the Messenger and pulled her husband out with a rope around his neck?
Had they come from somewhere outside?
was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
without accepting reality neither the motives can be diminished nor correction can be made.
O' BBC please stop this dual-headed policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
please show some modesty, a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office.
the success of, operation Sherdil and across the border operation Lion heart, depends on the fact that in whose favor is the opinion of general public.
this act is of American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahab is a victim of this conspiracy.
all discussions on this forum will now be anti Taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined Taliban and they are doing what can change the public opinion.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public. They even report something like this 'Bombing on Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000, in Swat went there to do.
That the bodies of the Taliban who helps the army is left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake stop this drama.
These Talibans have tarnished the Muslim image.
If in the whole world true Muslims don't call these terrorists as Muslims then how come these elements are able to live in the lands of true Muslims.
Those who become shameless, can't do hard labor they pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
Its need is neither in any religion nor in any customs.
All media including BBC gives thier views about taliban and tribal areas by different resources
But nobody knows what the actual situation is. It is we who know about it because we are tribals.
In short this is a game in which CIA, RAW, MUSAD, and our own ISI is involved.There is nothing like taliban or tribal people, they are the negative elements created by these institutions who are spoiling the name of Islam, Taliban, Religous institutes, Pukhtoon nation and Tribals.
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute the leader of MQM, Althaf Husain, and the leaderships of ANP and PPP, as they have spoken against this cancer, i.e. the Taliban.
This cancer was given birth to by Zia-ul-Haqq. He has gone, but he has destroyed Pakistan as he went.
But I have hope that the present government will eradicate this cancer.
After the Mumbai attacks, India had said that there was the hand of some Pakistani extremists behind the attack.
Pakistan refuted these claims and said that it would help India in investigation in every possible way.
India said that they have given Pakistan a list of the suspected extremists which India wanted.
Now, Pakistan said that the Jaish-e-Mohammad leader, who is included in the list, Moulana Mas'ood Azhar, is not under house arrest, and that the government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Previously, the President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari had rejected the idea that western intelligence agencies and the Indian government had provided Pakistan proof about the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said regarding Ajmal Kasab, that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
At that time,Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that their relationship with India could not improve as long as their land continues to be used for terrorism.
And in the latest developments, the Indian cricket team cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should these political events affect sports.
What do you see the future of Indo-Pak relations looking like?
Neither America nor India will break Pakistan.
Pakistan will break itself.
With so much regionalism, factionism and infiltration, what else can you expect?
Time has proved that Jinnah did not do good to the Indian Muslims.
Yasmin, Chicago
Madam, if work was continued in Jinnah's manner, neither would the tumors of regionalism, factionism and infiltration have spread in Pakistan, nor would the Indian Muslims been treated in this way.
but it's our fault that we could not bring up a leader like his stature.
if we can not care for our heroes, then
this region has great capabilities.
god knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
in both countries the enemies to peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv sena, RSS have been raised.
and the evil powers don't want this region to progress therefore these countries are controlled like puppets.
can you imagine what status will this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world.
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
may Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
but Sir, open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
moreover, the internal affairs don't seem to be good, as you can see the circumstances in NWFP, Balochistan and in Karachi in Sindh.
in this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
O Allah bestow your mercy upon us.
Account to my understanding, a final war is inevitable.
this is enough of it.
now it should be do or die.
this problem can not be solved through these acts of insincere dialogues.
and not through small scale terrorism in each other's country.
after all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
and if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be finished.
But our military leadership does not seem to be sincere in these regards. On the one hand, America and Europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism, and on the other hand we secretly help the Taiban.
We should think and fix our direction and choose only one way. Thanks.
There is no doubt that majority of the workers of Jama'athud Da'wah are the previous members of Lashkar-e-Taiba who joint the group called Jama'athud Da'wah Pakistan, after Lashkar-e-Taiba was rendered inexistent.
However, after that, the members gave preference to social work, and now even Jama'athud Da'wah was rendered inexistent by the United Nations, due to the pressure applied by India and the crackdown being enforced by the Pakistani government.
I believe that if Jihadi groups leave religious fundamentalism and take up social efforts, that would be better.
The present terrorist groups that bring up criminals in the name of Jihad, and the elders of these Mullas, are the same people who used to call 'Pakistan' 'Palidistan', and who knows what else.
Now they are not leaving any stone unturned in destroying Pakistan.
Actually, these are not even fit to be called human beings, let alone 'Muslims'.
Without cleaning Pakistan of these mischief mongers, the national security will remain at risk.
Can we still think about whether or not to put a ban on these mischief mongers?
There is no place on earth for extremist Mullahs whose only work is to cause killings.
This news tore my heart.
What kind of world is that in which it has become difficult for those who even take the name of one of the important parts of the religion of Allah, Islam.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims, but if a Muslim even tries to extract revenge, along with the whole non-Muslim world, even the hypocrite leaders join and treat those who have sincere religious feeling in the manner our great leaders are treating Hafiz Saeed.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-
Pak relationships turned sour, because of which the proximity between the two countries forming after many years, for the first time suffered a severe setback.
India has always claimed that militant and non-militant groups which are active in Pakistan were responsible.
For the relationships to return to normal, taking action against these countries is being made a prerequisite,
Whereas Indian security agencies have accused Lashkar-e-Taiba of being directly responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
The name of Jama'athud Da'wah also comes up many times in this regards.
This is not the first time that relationships between the two countries have become serious due to some terrorist activity that took place in India.
In December 2001, after the attack on the parliament, the two neighbors were prepared to go to war.
After that, Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned and it was included in the list of terrorist groups.
Now, it is being demanded that Jama'athud Da'wah, which according to security reports is just a new form of Lashkar-e-Taiba, also be banned.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against the active fundamentalist groups within its boundaries or not?
Can putting a ban on Jama'athud Da'wah help the present Indo-
Pak crisis to subside, and how important is it for permanent peace between the two countries that armed groups be dismantled?
The Security Council of the United Nations has passed the ban on Jama'athud Da'wah. However, what proof did the Security Council have based on which it showed such urgency.
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful state.
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salute, sir, salute happily, but get your work done on your own.
Do not do it under the pressure from America.
If India is in difficulty, let them prove it, no?
Why does it not give?
And why do they accuse us with everything?
There are fundamentalist groups and organisations, even in India. Why does no one put any restrictions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the whole world?
What is it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What is it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the first Islamic Nuclear State. Why, is what the fight is about.
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart and circumstances also seems to be such
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be the part of this conspiracy.
American are not slowly but now very swiftly tightening there grip over Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances,if we as a nation does not display unity and solidarity then if Bangladesh can be created,anything else can also happen.
Terrorist attacks should be condemned to the maximum, whether they are on the Mumbai Hotel or the Marriot Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine.
Similarly, terrorists should be hunted down irrespective of their nationality and whether they are Pakistani, Indian, American or Israeli.
Now the question is that every day terrorist attacks take place in Pakistan, hundreds of people die but the Pakistani officials along with the rest of the world stay silent.
Wasn’t the attack on the Marriot Hotel an act of terrorism?
Then why?
Hats off to Home Advisor, Mr. Rahman Malik. Masha Allah, he has become so brave and courageous.
?
Not only that, according to BBC, the mentioned Mr. Malik has vehemently disproved this belief that the arrest of terrorists were being done at the 'request of others'.
Brother, Subhanallah!
Whether the ability is there or not, or whether it should be said that it is not needed.
We, i.e. Pakistan, are fighting somebody else's war
And why are there our own interest which we are trying so hard to save?
No one has the right to interfere in any country's affairs.
This does not seem to be the era of new populations.
If people expect justice, or demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan, which I think is not acceptable by those calling for unity.
As such, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
And this causes more opposing feelings.
If they trust America and the United republics, then let them leave the style of new populations, and let them work on those lines, upholding the sovereignty of the state.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
In Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, security forces captured a proved camp of practically non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India's accusation is that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Minister, Condoleeza Rice told the Pakistani leadership that there should be immediate action taken against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack.
It is their claim that without a doubt, the extremists who carried out the Mumbai attacks used Pakistani land.
In the meanwhile, officials in Peshawar claim that the lot of trucks which carry supplies to the united forces in Afghanistan was burnt by unidentified armed people, because of which more than 50 trucks were destroyed.
This is the second attack in Peshawar on NATO and American supplies in the last 48 hours.
In the meanwhile, Pakistan captured an established camp of the almost inexistent Lashkar-e-Taiba. Previously, lots of efforts were carried out to try to disarm armed groups all the way from Karachi to the tribal regions, which included giving compensation to those who returned their weapons and even ascertaining them that no action would be taken against them.
The situation is telling us that the efforts undertaken in the regime of General Ziyaul Haqq, after the previous Soviet Union's interference in Afghanistan to get rid of the armed groups that formed as a result of the resistance that started through American and Saudi funding, and to bring an environment similar to that before 1980 were not successful.
The question is what does Pakistan want to do?
Does Pakistan have the ability to do so?
What do you say?

I have only one question for the standard bearers of the world.
If you kill their children, will they come to garland you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill innocent public, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in negative, then you really need to fix your viewpoint.
The people were armed when there was the fear that Russia would head towards Pakistan after finishing Afghanistan, and that is why they were supplied arms.
Now, when there is the fear that America will capture Pakistan, via Afghanistan, as the president American president has clearly mentioned in his presidential mission, why should we disarm them now?
Only so that after defeating the American or Indian army, it does not have to face any resistance from the public?
Yes, if any of them are guilty of being involved in any destructive work, Pakistan can take action against them alone.
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
And another question is that were these terrorists not supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the present terrorism is in no way connected to it.
It must be remembered that Hafiz Saeed is the first 'Jehadi leader' who called the Taliban actions 'mischief'.
I am sure that the Taliban effect is a inseparable result of American plans, and hence every person who can stand in the way of Taliban must be removed.
Despite the support of the whole nation, the fact that Zardari and co. took action against the Lashkar is a clear sign of their frigid and kiss-up nature.
To stop the project that is running on Saudi-American funding, they must be requested themselves to regather, for God's sake, the filth that has polluted our society.
And also protest against them asking them based on what ethics, America and Saudi spread dangerous weapons and so called Jihadi, but in reality hate inciting and cultural virus enticing literature in our country, because of which our country has become a human slaughterhouse.
After facing the risk of attack from India, the Pakistani Army's announcement that it would remove forces from the Afghan border and post them at the Indian border, and the announcement of the Taliban that it would handle the Afghan border, caused America to stumble, and pressurize India not to attack Pakistan.
This showed the strength of America in the region.
Though India did not warn that they would attack, and nor do they have that much courage.
The Taliban attacked and finished most of the remaining American supplies.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and tha Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi is the trade and financial center of Pakistan, and the Dubai of the backward regions.
Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty handed, but ever since the law and order situation in the western border regions was lost, all people diverted their attention here.
Now they waant to kidnap this city.
For the first time, Pathans began to be called Pukhtons, and the people of a single town are made foreigners and are being made to fight, while the need is for unity.
One solution to this problem is that either the Urdu speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun speaking people learn Urdu, or better yet, both learn English.
You might think that this is a funny proposal, but does the cause of the conflict not seem funny?
That the cause of extremism be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, I actually shared this proposal many times in my childhood with my friends, which included people from all religious and linguistic groups, but these people used to laugh at me.
At that time, the religious and linguistic hate, which was not as lively and strong as they are today, were still developing within.
I can never understand what is happening and why?
Are these the signs of the Day of Judgement?
For what crime are innocent people being killed?
The reasons are in front of everybody. Those who want to break up Pakistan are the active ones, and those who do such things, have neither religion, nor country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns
Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir mean that which is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
At the height of the Mumbai attacks, the fact that the efforts to cause mischief on linguistic and racial lines in Karachi failed is proof that those politicians working on racial parole have resigned from their jobs.
The taking of the lives of innocent Pushtu speaking labourers and the Indian warnings have awakened the sleeping Pakistani feelings from Karachi to Khyber.
The identical country loving reaction of all the political, religious, linguistic and national parties has not only taught India the manners of diplomacy but it has also given the American policy makers a chance to think again.
The responsible parties for the worsening situation in Karachi are the United and the ANP, and the government is taking sides.
The government can control the situation in one hour, but it is purposely allowing it to grow.
The police and rangers are avoiding action because of the pressure on them by the political parties.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
As long as there will be political pressure on the government, more such incidents will take place. May Allah save Pakistan.
I believe these people are the biggest terrorists.
And there are definitely some foreign forces at work here, but I do not know whose?
And the sad thing is that if such a situation was prevalent in any border town, the government would take care of that place, but as this is far from the border, the government looks helpless.
The government should set up an operation here, and save a big and important town from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth due to fear, and as for the local media, it is even thinner.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that either the Urdu speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun speaking people learn Urdu or even better, both learn English.
Definitely, you might think this is a funny proposal, but do you not think the reason for the clashes is funny?
that the cause of extremism be language?
They spilled blood in Karachi and the story that each citizen was fearing for a long time was finally written.
No one left any stone unturned, and the reports that surfaced in the media was 50% of what actually happened here in four days.
I stayed up the last three nights and I am still afraid.
The people who killed the cobblers and peanut sellers who evacuated the hotel
The people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of Allah's punishment which can catch them anytime.
What do you think are the reasons for this sudden violence?
(BBC)
Keeping the heart rendering Mumbai attacks in view and diving to search for a cause for the violence in Karachi is not at all needed, rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in 'blood'.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control.
The blood of Liyaqath Ali Khan and many other brave hearts was also from there. I am writing this poem to get rid of Saiko's misunderstanding.
We will also repeat the traditions of the elders
They gave their lives to build, we will give our lives to save.
Faizan Touseef Siddiqi
It is very sad that we are fighting each other at a time when the whole country is under attack.
I tell Mr. Siddiqi that if he checks Wikipedia.org
for Liyaqath Ali Khan, then he will know that he was from a repectable Punjabi family, in the Karnal region of Punjab district.
Because of his steps for immigrants, today the immigrant call him their own.
Every action has a reaction.
One can bear ones self, but..
I'jaz A'wan
Sir, before you get a large number of people with proposals, I shall tell you that the open signs of this mischief is also found on the walls of Karachi, in the form of posters and wall chalking.
We have been bearing both types of mischief.
Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan. They did not have to face any reaction.
Contrary to that, they are pecking at the chest of Pakistan.
There used to be one Muslim League (n), but they also made the rough version of the 18th amendment and handed it over to the Peoples Party.
Before that, MQM and Muslim League (q) had already handed in rough versions of the 18th amendment to the national assembly and senate.
It still seems that the copies of the 18th amendment is a political trickery, and no one is sincere about accepting that amendment.
This is why no fuss was made in the assembly or on the floor of senate over this amendment, and the parliament was not forced into accepting the amendment.
It looks as if the parties just wanted to get the thing off their backs by submitting the rough versions, so that tomorrow, they may say that we had submitted our versions of the amendment, but the government speaker did not take action.
MQM the government, Muslim League N in the opposition and Muslim League Q was the party who passed 17th amendment so how is it possible that these parties will be sincere in finishing the 17th amendment.
This is what is called getting credit for nothing.
People's party is already not in a hurry about finishing 17th amendment.
How can someone think of cutting their own hands?
17th amendment will not be canceled until Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of the majority in our survey and it is also true.
If 17th amendment was to be discarded then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf. Because with being the president, he is also the chairman of the People's Party.
17th amendment is valid until he is the president.
In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to bid Zardari farewell from the president house.
This is not the will of MQM nor of other parties.
In our family, most of the people are of the laborer type.
And in our childhood, when we used to see our uncles toil, we used to wish in our hearts that Allah save us from labor that is hard on the body.
To save ourselves from this, we wrote a letter to the editor of the Amroz daily, asking him what we can do after metric to save ourselves from having to toil.
The editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and take such and such subjects.
My focus was always on engineering, and after metric, instead of Biology, I took Technical Drawing.
But while entering the FSC, my elder brother forced me to do FSC in medicine and become a doctor.
I studied Biology for a month with great difficulty, and when I still could not understand anything, I took maths as a subject instead.
So the scare of having to work made me an engineer, and today I am in a very good condition compared to many of my same aged relatives, for which I am always thanking Allah.
I remembered this when I was trying to lift the carpet of my old house along with my two young sons.
It was not half an hour since we started working, that the younger son said "Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job"
We said, if that is true, then study a lot like us, and free yourself from bodily pain.
The son said that I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work.
Anyway, the three of us finished that work in three hours and returned.
My purpose of saying this is that if a person has set a goal, whatever be the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving his goal.
But if you do not even know what you have to do, then Allah alone is your protector.
They say that you should not speak bad about the dead, but what can I do, even after one year of Benazir's death, I can only see faults in her.
For personal interests, Benazir handed over the list of Sikhs who were fighting for independence to India, at the same time crushing the Sikhs independence movement and also allowing India to transfer its complete attention to Pakistan, having taken care of the Punjab movement.
The Russia wars in the regimes of Benazir and Nawaz Sherif have become a part of history, which pushed the country many years back.
Benazir continued to speak ill about Kashmir and the atomic program throughout exile.
Benazir Bhutto struck a deal with Musharraf, going against her London Treaty with Nawaz Sharif
Benazir allowed her husband to openly earn money, in her era, which is why he came to be known as Mr. Ten Percent.
In Benazir's era, her brother was killed, and his killer is still not been punished.
Despite being a woman, Benazir avoided fighting for women rights.
In a way similar to how Benazir did politics on her father's corpse, her widower husband is now doing politics on her corpse.
Benazir came to power twice, but let alone bring the people guilty for the political killing of her father to justice, she could not even file a case against them.
It is 37 years since East Pakistan was separated from us, and look at the height of insensitivity on the part of the public and the rulers, that no one ever mourned or expressed sorrow over their mistakes.
We should have been observing 16th December as a day of reflection, and made plans to prevent the re occurrence of such incidents.
We should have been sending greetings to the people of Bangladesh on this day and been trying to bring them closer to ourselves.
The ruler should have opened the Jamudur Rahman commission file and pondered over the causes of separation of West Pakistan, mentioned therein.
He would plan on bringing back the people of Bihar who were stuck in Bangladesh and he would send them gifts to keep their spirits up.
We have become so insensitive that if someone dies in our neighborhood, we are not even aware of it.
We do not care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
A huge calamity can pass by, but the next day we are lost in our day-to-day routine of life.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again, like East and West Germany became one.
We can become one again, if we sacrifice a little for each other and leave our selfishness behind us.
But this wish does not look like it will be fulfilled in the near future.
Today, when it was announced in the news that the governor of American state Illinois was caught on corruption charges
and that he would soon be brought to account for removal from Governorship by the state congress, an American white friend of mine, who had deep insight into the situation in Pakistan, he told us, showing off, look this is called democracy.
In America, no gigantic figure is beyond the law.
And the other is your country, Pakistan, where even the President was chosen after the corruption charges against him were dropped.
My vein of loyalty throbbed and I said what is the big deal if a governor was arrested in America. In our Pakistan, once the Prime Minister was arrested and hanged overnight, and another time sent into exile.
Tell me, when did this happen in America?
In Pakistan, those who broke the law were sent out of the presidential palace with a guard of honor. Tell me when this happened in America.
The Chief Justice of Pakistan was removed in such a manner, that despite having public support, he could not be replaced until now. Has this happened in America?
In Pakistan, a fake-degree holder was made the Minister of Health. Did this happen in America?
Hearing this, the American laughed till he was tired and conceded defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded on all four sides by Americans.
It seems from his smile that
he thinks that America is with his government. He is forgetting that one year ago, they were with Pervez Musharraf.
This picture was passed on, as if it was of some family.
Previously, such a photo was never printed in newspapers before, i.e. one president with three American agents.
It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.
It is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.
If it was a smart ruler, at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo, and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting.
If the rules of democracy are implemented on this photo, President Zardari is in minority.
According to democracy, the majority are the rulers of the country, and the photo is speaking for itself who that is?
Paradise-like Swat is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
According to the government tactic so far, along with force, discussions have been going on.
But the use of force is not giving any benefit other than increasing the force of the Taliban and increasing the public favor for them.
It is required that the government finish the causes of this problem, rather than use force.
By finishing the causes, Fazlullah and the Taliban will be finished themselves.
The proposed Shariah bill of the ANP government will become a moderate solution to the problems in Swat.
But alongside the establishment of the Shariah, the government will also have to take care of economic problems.
From General Musharraf's initial few steps, it looked as if the nation would be freed of useless politicians, but the love for power changed all his plans.
Whatever expectations were, after joining the 'war of terror', he began to consider himself irremovable.
And whatever steps were expected were no more.
Just as Bush's rule began to close, he started to worry about the end of his own rule, and he struck a deal with thieves in the dark.
Even then, General Musharraf could have commanded the army, but the present government does not even know what is happening.
Whether in Bajod or Swat, the army cannot control terror, and instead they bomb the 'enemy', i.e. the public. Apart from loss of life and money, if they are making the 'enemy' psychologically ill, then we are the enemies, aren't we?
In Swat, the strongly affected part of Sarhad state, despite the continuity of military action for over one year, the situation is still going from bad to worse.
On one side, the government is only reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly. On the other side, the Taliban's illegal radio FM channel is having much more influence in the region.
On the third side, the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region.
During the action of the security forces, there were claims of destroying the fundamentalists by the bombing of gun ship helicopters and cannon houses, but despite these destructions, the Taliban only became more powerful, and according to an estimation, their control over Swat increased that much percent more.
As a result, on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat, and on the other hand the Taliban is stronger.
Who is stuck in  between? The poor civilians.
It is said in Swat, that someone asked what kind of people are the Taliban were, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of Allah and the religion'.
Then he asked how the army was, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country'.
He then asked who the enemies of the religion and the country were, so he got the answer, 'We civilians'.
I am wondering how the Pakistani Army will fight the Indian Army, when they couldn't control a small faction of the Taliban.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
But still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
After the girls schools, now boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfews are called so that the Taliban can move around easily.
During curfew tonight, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
The question arises as to how they got there despite the curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone explain to the army to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the Army can defeat any enemy.
You say that mostly blood is spilled in the world because of religion. Tell me today, if there was no religion, would all this killing not take place?
Are Punjabi, Pathan, White, Black, Mahsood and other tribes the result of religion?
No, sir, no way! Only religion teaches that there is no black and white, there is no Punjabi and no immigrant. If it were not for religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between the white and the black, and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribe-brotherhood hatred.
Actually, only religion trains man's character and restricts him, as he has not come here on his own will, but rather the Creator of all that exists sent him here, and he must live here according to His commands.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France, for two years, I also felt the same way.
I do not know why people only expect us to call.
A resolution about Iraq, passed in a few hours, to send a 'peace' force to Darfur is not at all a problem.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where there is a matter of death, we are still holding meetings about that.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
Is the wait really going on for it to finish?
So that some oppressed person would not even be able to think about using some mass destruction weapon like ill will to obtain their right?
When a father is running around holding the corpse of his son, even then a small wave of sorrow does not arise from any part of your heart.
If not, you have no right to be called a human.
Rather you are a black spot on the name of humanity.
OK, this was proved that this area was also the home of the Israelis for thousands of years.
Ideally, these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection, but since their strings are in the hands of the western and Arab countries, therefore peace is not possible without their will.
Rather, now even Iran wants to fight a proxy war from here.
Even if Israeli action has stopped for a while, it will start again after some incident.
The interest of the owner of BBC is associated with serving America and Israel, and this is why in the name of 'enlightenment' it has come out with a series of Zionist favoring blogs, and is doing a biased and blind propaganda.
BBC is only completing a formality, and its goal and intent is only to gather well wishes.
I request the moderator to publish this comment of Fidwi, so it be known that at least a little bit of affinity towards truth is still remaining in BBC
Thank You.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How could I not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time, including Derah Gahzi Khan, summer showers are taking place throughout the country.
Presented is a poem according to the season. Enjoy the rain along with this poem.
These rains are also from you
which when fell brings spring.
When it stops there is no movement
sometimes it came just like that, without a reason.
Sometimes it spread day and night.
sometimes loudly, sometimes silently.
These rains are also from you
in some remembrance some night
on some suppressed ashes
Sometimes it was such, that the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burnt itself.
Sometimes each drop seems sorrowful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What is it to them, whether the country lasts or not.
Whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them.
For one, our media is also corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government, and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday afternoon something surprising happened.
All police are running here and there, but don't ask about illegal parking.
What's more, NYPD traffic was not in the state where it could look at illegally parked vehicles.
Something like this happened, that a plane of the US Air really became a ship and landed in the Hudson river.
Until now, we only now that terrorists are of the descendants of geese.
Yesterday was perhaps historic cold, in New York.
The temperature does not fall this much.
Even my jaws started hurting from my half an hour walk outside.
Imagine, how the people who jumped from the plane into the river would have felt.
It is a matter of happiness that all people were safe.
And it was sad that the companies plane drowned during this financial crisis.
I went by West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I still do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, in my one hour trip, the way had opened at least a bit, so I was able to get the 56th street exit.
Otherwise, I had not taken the previous two exits, seeing the lines waiting at them.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women
Shaguftah: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I have slaughtered two chickens and how they are slaughtered, Jahanzeb has already mentioned.
Apart from this, there is no other way.

Snow till disappear
For no reason, we thought that the Taliban group from Sawat was non religious, who were only against women education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
But like majority of the ideas, this was not proven right also. According to this news of CNN, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a Boys school with gunpowder.
Swat, The Taliban has destroyed a boys school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Amen, then Amen.
Masha Allah, up till now, 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom of fixing marriages before birth among Muslims, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See a picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
just a while before this, the wedding of a dog with a girl took place.
look at that groom.
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
it is the era of computers and its involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life.
many people have many reservation over this increasing involvement of computer, for example, in financial matters.
where use of credit card bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
so now only through your financial matters like through your credit card, you can be located.
and in future when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent, its benefits will increase more and more.
similarly in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, the credit card information is stolen.
similarly computers have become the source of friendship.
Social networking sites, like Orkut, Facebook and Myspace are at first level of acceptance.
But do you not think that the more we are following these social networking sites, the further we are getting from people in real life?
Similar are the match making websites, where your desires are matched with others desires and you are shown a list of the people who match with you.
But can you lead a life with a person who is just like you?
I can not, and that is why the spouse is called the better half,
because he/she will get rid of the faults within me.
Perhaps I have got a small share of sense.
I used to believe everything someone elder says.
In the same way, I thought that my father knew the answer to every question on earth.
I used to get laughed at a lot for this.
But only that seems true which can be possible.
It is very troubling, that what is the need to tell lies.
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
That is why I try to lie as less as possible.
that I do not falsely please others, that too with the name of Allah.
And that I say Insha Allah (If God Wills) only when I am asking Allah to complete the work.
As for the intentions, only Allah knows best.
This is a despicable matter that arose due to distance from religion.
According to both our religion and Pakistani law, young children should stay with their mothers.
Their expenses are to be borne by the father, and the father can meet his children.
Then when the child becomes of age, he or she can stay with whomever they will.
You rightly mentioned that the actual problem is that of the relatives who mislead.
Possessiveness is present in all our actions.
It is this very factor in effect over here, that there will be new shareholders in the father's property born, and they will go against him. Otherwise his fathers action is commendable.
These restrictions have caused social evils, even in our marriages.
The concept of the marriage of a divorced woman or a widow has become obscure.
It is these wasteful ideologies and baseless traditions that have made the family structure a mess.
In our society, if the wife of a 50-55 year old man or the husband of such a wife passes away, why are they not looked at in a nice manner?
Near us, there is a Pakistani uncle, whose wife passed away 10-12 years ago. Now, after marrying off all his children, he has married a widow, so even his children have gone against him.
I believe this is his legitimate right. What do you say?
What type of mentality is the 'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place', kind of mentality?
I believe that this persons children should have thought what is wrong if he married a widow, after he married off all his children?
Thereby, this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
As the children would definitely have gotten busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow if their wives refuse to look after them, when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society, which we are facing for the last 40-50 years.
A wife can accept her husband going around having illicit relations, but she cannot stand him having a second wife.
If possible, stop him from doing so, even after you die.
She destroys her husband and her own hereafter, and becomes a cause for spreading filthiness in the society.
Chanting Islam, Islam does not mean anything. In reality, we like only our culture and traditions.
For instance keeping girls  from gaining education and fearing marrying the girl of ones choice.
As for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house, so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax, (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt).
In the Indo Pak subcontinent, Islam was accepted centuries ago, but it could not yet leave its ignorant mentality and has always kept culture and tradition above Islam.
Thinking of a man's second marriage as an innovation, divorce as a clinical rest, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife, is all a part of this mentality.
What's more, in mimicry of the western countries, we have started to consider piety and veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam is easy, but leaving this mentality is very tough.
Allah bless us all the courage for it.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never that difficult.

Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes that i found this secret in my life that if leader of any Army is in front line then that Army will never lose.

if someone from common people dies then murder
AsSalaamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu (greeting)
Today, as I was returning to my shop, after Isha prayer, when a man sitting in a car at the circle raised his hand and diverted my attention towards him.
I thought this man might have lost his way, or he might want to ask something, so I stopped, and his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked whether I could understand Arabic well or not. I said no problem, tell me what you want.
He started to say that I have come from Riyadh, to Madinah, but someone has pick-pocketed me, so please help me out. I asked him to excuse me, as such an incident had taken place with me previously, that I had given the person 20 Riyals to buy petrol to reach Riyadh, but he went a little ahead and started to ask somebody else.
I got very angry and scolded him and warned him that I would call the soldiers, so he got very frightened.
Now the situation  has become, that we Muslims come on cars, with our families to beg throughout the day and gain at least two or three thousand illegally.
Whereas there is a clear Hadith of the Prophet (SAWS) that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand; the lower hand being the begging hand and the upper hand being the giving one.
May Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims (Amen, Amen)

Famous singer Adnan Sami's wife reached a police station in Mumbai, accusing him of torturing her.
The Police station advised her to contact a court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Giladari gave a complaint against her husband saying that he continuously tortures her.
and that he treats her in a non-human manner.
Now, it has become difficult for her to bear, and that is why she has filed a case against him.
The police, instead of filing a case, told her to contact a court, saying that this matter was not one in which the police could put their hands.
In your opinion, is the accusation against Adnan Sami, by his wife proper?
This is not an Indian effort to disgrace Adnan Sami, is it?
Let us know about your opinion on this issue.
Adam, Sanghad, Mehr
As far as accusations go, any person can accuse the other.
To get enraged for honor is not sensible.
Whatever be the case between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he had left his honorable life and went to India to earn money. Now that fame has fallen around his neck.
This is the result of his own actions.
Washington...
High ambassadors of America say that President Obama will take a strong stand against Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
In America's new policy for Afghanistan, instead of development, war has been given more importance.
The envoys say that Hamid Karzai is being considered a barrier in the achievement of American goals in Afghanistan, as there is corruption in the government and the business of middlemen has increased and the Taliban are once more gathering strength.
The American envoys say that among the people in the American government who are stressing upon Hamid Karzai to do something more are Vice President Joseph Biden and President Obama's representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Hallbrooke.
He said that this policy appeared after President Bush, who used to video conference with Hamid Karzai every two weeks, left. He used to stress upon the American role in rebuilding Afghanistan and its civilian institutions.
Officials say that the Obama government would work with the State leaders rather than the central government.
The officials say that it will pressurize Karzai to step up the war against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing fresh elections this year, and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his group will support Karzai for presidency or not.
This statement of the American officials is not a precursor for a change in the American policy towards Afghanistan, is it?
Is Hamid Karzai's rule coming to an end?

In a series of three one day matches between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2-1.
Pakistan had defeated Sri Lanka in the first match, but Sri Lanka was victorious in the remaining two matches.
In the third one day match, the national cricket team's performance was very poor. In reply to Sri Lanka's 309 runs, it only managed to hit 75 runs in 23 overs before going all out. As such, it had to face a humiliating loss.
From the results of the series, it becomes evident that the performance of the national cricket team is not consistent.
Despite home ground and all claims, the national team suffered defeat. What do you think are the reasons?
Which aspects of the game should experts focus on?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
Which part do you place the responsibility of the loss on, fielding, batting or bowling?
Let us know of your opinion.
Malik Babar Husain, Jeddah. It is very sad that even in todays modern age, such ignorant traditions are prevalent. If the landlord or the property owner targets innocent people with his harsh dictatorship, who will call them Muslims?
Let any big shot walk on these burning coals. Why does the government allow them to do that?
When will court justice come into play?
The Sri Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan, to play the one day international series.
Visit of a foreign team to Pakistan, in spite of Pak India tension is a good sign.
On reaching Karachi Airport the Sir Lankan team was given a warm welcome.
Two matches will be held between Pakistan and Sir Lanka in Karachi while the third one will be played in Lahore.
Both teams are asserting highly regarding their batting, bowling and fielding.
If Siri Lanka venerates its spinners, Pakistan’s reliance is on its fast bowlers.
Sir Lanka’s captain Mahela Jayawardene says that no one player but the whole Pakistan cricket team is dangerous.
Muralidharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, while Pakistan’s captain says that this competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik has said “we have played Murali Dharan before and will take care of Mendis as well. We have made a secret game plan and will reveal it on the ground”.
Will the Pakistan and Sir Lanka series live up to claims of being interesting and thrilling?
Which side will dominate in the Pakistan and Siri Lanka series?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?

Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.

How is all this is double for these people, when the Kashmiri people have been fighting for independence for the last 60 years?
No, no one asked, and they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism, so they start talking about making up.
First they openly killed the Muslims, now they are in the efforts of setting things right.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating such a situation that the world's attention can be diverted from Kashmir.
but Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now the British Government is also understanding that the Indians are taking cover from their occupation over Kashmir by blaming Pakistan of terrorism.
and they hesitate to talk to Pakistan over this issue.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that by resolving the issue of Kashmir will bring an end to extremism, the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
it should be clear that the newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister while talking to media in Mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Is India using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialog?
Let us know of your opinion.
Usman Aftab,
I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
Rather it wants to keep it in check, and hence is thinking of taking certain steps. They know that Pakistan is a nuclear state.
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries are only thinking that if they corner Pakistan, they would face some political and geographic problems. They want to help Pakistan, but also want to be successful in their goal.
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn Pakistan.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.

Ras al Khaima, This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is in how deep waters.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers movement not played any role?
What do you have to say about this statement of the Prime Minister?
Make us aware about your opinion.
American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference advised newly elected President Barack Obama saying that he had made many mistakes in his presidency, and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
'I did, as a president, whatever I felt was appropriate, according to the situation, and the American law and constitution, giving preference to American interest over my own acceptance'.
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him, and considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this is my last press conference, and I thank the journalists and other friends who are present in the press conference.
Do you think Obama will not repeat the mistakes that Bush made?
Did Bush delay accepting his mistake?
Will Obama be able to follow Bush's advice?

The American Vice President Dick Cheney says I want to see Usama Bin Laden alive or dead.
He says that Usama Bin Laden is hiding in some hard to reach area and is of no use to his organization, if Usama Bin Laden is arrested alive or dead then his organization must be destroyed.
America is ambitious on the arrest of Usama and the search of Usama is on.
Will Dick Cheney's wish of arresting Usama be accomplished?

After that Shahid Affridi said that without any reason he was made an issue therefore at that time he was in a hurry to attend the Prayer.
Any way, I beg pardon for this drama.
What do you say about Shahid Afridi's actions?

Manmohan Singh once again accused Pakistan of creating a war-like atmosphere.
and that Pakistan is using terrorism as a policy of state.
Speaking to a meeting of the cabinet of ministers, Manmohan Singh said that terrorist factions are being supported by neighbouring countries, especially Pakistan.
And that the terrorists who attacked Mumbai used the sea way and remained safe from the coastal guard.
The Indian Prime Minister said that the Mumbai attacks of November were carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba.
He said that the terrorists were using new techniques and modern communication systems. We will have to step up the forces at the line of control as well, from where there is infiltration. He said that terrorism will not be accepted in any form, and this is our policy.
How do you see this accusation of the Indian Prime Minister?
Do the internally opposed and separatist movements of India show the disturbed situation n India?
On whose orders is India taking this warning stance?
Give us your views.

This is a sad calamity that Israeli is massacring the Palestinians and the same situation is prevalent in Kashmir, but there is no effect on the Security Council.
All the organisations present in Palestine and Kashmir should keep their war going until they gain independence, and they should form unity among themselves and keep facing any type of harm, and one day or the other their martyrdom will give fruit, God Willing.
The air attacks by Israel on Gaza are continuing, just the same. Until now, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
Important Hamas leader Nazariyan was killed along with hwife and children.
Here the Security Council meeting concluded without any decision.
The meeting saw American opposition to the derogatory resolutions passed against Israel by Libya and other Arab countries.
From the last few days there has been bombing by Israeli planes on the Palestinian civilian population.
The whole world cried out about the Mumbai issue, but the Israeli attacks do not seem a massacre to anyone including America and Britain.
Why are the important Islamic countries quiet?
What do you want to say about this double standard of the world?
Saeed, New York
I think that actually, most of our people are illiterate. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties, the electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has taken a serious position.
On the other side, there was an increase of an average of 18% in gas rates, while the unavailability of petrol in some cities has become a cause of great difficulty for the public.
Among the manufacturing and business circles, there are strong protests and severe reactions going on, to the long power cut and gas crisis.
The producers have given the ultimatum to close the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is perturbed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
The production life cycle has become practically paralyzed.
The government institutions are blaming each other to express their stand.
Are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas not a joke against the nation?
Why is attention not being paid to solve the problems.
Are the wheels of national development not seeming jammed to the government?
What immediate steps can you suggest to gain control over this crisis?
Let us know of your opinions.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that they are giving difficulty to the public who called for a democratic government.
The unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a torture.
There is no control over government institutions.
The law and order situation is getting worse, day to day. May Allah have mercy on this country.
The New Year started.
The previous year was a year of protests and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered for terrorism.
The removal of President Musharraf from power, and President Bush's eight year regime coming to an end, Bush getting shoes thrown at and the establishment of a democratic government in Pakistan, sudden calamities, the earthquake of Balochistan, the global financial crisis and depression.
Now a new year has arrived, how do you see the new year?
According to you, what color will the political and geographic scenario take, and what wise steps will Obama implement?
Is there any hope of moving towards eradication of terrorism?
will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?
what direction will the Indo-Pak relation take?
is there a chance of surgical strikes or a full fledge war?
what are you expectation from the new year?
please provide your feedback.
First death anniversary of Benazir Bhutto Shaheed is being celebrated. she was martyred on 27th of December, 2007 after a  congregation at the Liaqat Bagh in Rawalpindi.
Benazir is no more amongst us, she was a statesman, politician and world famous personality and had a unique status in national politics.
One year has gone by but the mystery of her martyrdom has not yet been resolved.
her efforts in bringing democracy in Pakistan and formation of government have not gone in vain.
Today Pakistan has a democratic government and her husband Asif Ali Zardari is holding the chair of the president.
What do you think is the role of martyr Benazir Bhutto in Pakistani politics?
Who can be behind murdering her?
Recently,, she was given the global human rights award. What would you like to say about her democratic and political services?
After ruling over America for eight years, President Bush left the White House, for presidential camp office, Camp David, so that the White House can be decorated and prepared for new President Barack Obama, according to his wishes.
In Bush's eight year presidency, the historic World Trade Center attack, the attack on the Pentagon, the action against Afghanistan and Iraq in the name of a global war against terrorism, in which armies of many countries were pulled into the war, and American resources were completely exhausted, were some of the memorable events of the Bush era.
As a result of this war, America had to face the worst economic and financial crisis in history.
What do you think the world got and what do you think they lost, as a result of this war?
Were the policies of President Bush successful?
What are your views of the Bush era?
The Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from touring Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, in an interview with Jeev News said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour, but due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step? Should sports not be separated from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision not harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that the security condition in India is bad, the England cricket team is continuing its tour, so why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this?
Salman, Karachi
Those people who are proud about going to India
and they make their films and videos over there, their eyes should open now, as to how much the people of India respect you.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan at the first opportunity, because he did not get honor there either.

After the Mumbai attacks, the mode of the Indians have changed.
Jagjeet Singh reacted by expressing that he hates Pakistan and Pakistanis.
It should be known that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsle and how has he become helpless now? Adnan Sami should stay in India. There is no need for him to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Aalam,
Karachi. I will only say so much about Jagjeet Singh, that he too changes colors like a chameleon,
and speaks on the occasion. Pakistanis, open your eyes and see how much you are respected in India. Do not be dull minded.
After the Mumbai incident, their hate filled speech has increased. Now they are spreading poison about famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to foreign news agencies, in the farewell trip of American President George Bush, during a press conference with the Prime Minister Nur-al-Maliki, in his office, the situation became hilarious when an Iraqi journalist called Bush saying "Dog, this is a farewell kiss".
After this, the journalist took his shoe off and threw it at Bush. President Bush ducked with expertise and saved himself from getting hit by the shoe.
The second shoe hit the American flag.
Security agents pulled this journalist away from there.
On this occasion, President Bush said that he did not know why he did that, the shoe was of size ten, he was not bothered.
In your opinion, does this action of the journalist show the anger of the Iraqi public against President Bush.
What do you say about this incident?
After the Mumbai terror incidents, the tension in Indo-Pak relations escalated to a grave extent, when Indian Air Force war planes violated Pakistani air space in the Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
Due to the reaction of the Pakistani Air Force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
According to sources, both Indian planes were full of weapons and ammunition.
This is the first of its kind incident in the current tensed situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that Air Force is all set for country's air defense.
Information Minister Sherry Rahman says that Indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed. Although, this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
In your opinion, does India really have an intention of air strike on Pakistan?
Is this statement of India correct that this violation was a mistake or this was to find out the ability of Pakistan Air force.
Is this incident not going to aggravate the current estrangement among the two countries?
Please inform us with your comments.
Respected martyr Benazir Bhutto was given the International Award for Human Rights after her death, which was received by her son and chairperson of the People's Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
During a session of General Assembly in United Nations headquarters, former prime minister of Pakistan, martyr Benazir Bhutto was presented with this award for acknowledgment of her efforts for human rights in a ceremony.
The 60th anniversary of the passing of the human rights resolution by the United Nations was celebrated on the 10th of December.
Among those people and institutes being recognized with honors on the occasion, for working for human rights, apart from Benazir Bhutto, were former American Attorney General, Louis Ramsey Clark and Human Rights Watch, the organisation that works around the world for human rights.
On this occasion, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Abdullah Husain Harun and other senior embassy agents were present.
What do you say about the former martyr Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto receiving this award?

It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she changed totally.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party, and made her son the representative of Peoples Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi, This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
But until the iron ax is not fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are just like this, that they are adopting secretive ways. This is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations have included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed as well as two other Pakistani citizens and that of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organisations into the list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaidah and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, practically non-existent organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba Operation Chief, Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organisations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organisations, they will be restricted from traveling and will be under arrest.
They will have to face cases.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India blaming these parties for the Bombay attacks without any proof?
Aren't there any terrorist groups in India?
Are International groups not aware of the tortures being done on the minorities in India?

Karachi, our leaders should understand this that people, they are doing the operation against, are the true valuers of Pakistan, who are tolerating all kinds of tortures but they love Pakistan.
If there would be war then they will fight for Pakistan.
When their love would be felt, just condenming politics will not work. I think between both, there might be going a resulting war.
