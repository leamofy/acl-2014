    <seg id="5">Thomas Reid said that based to many reasons, he has a belief that China had experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">the reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">he further added that this was the reason that in 1998 only in a span of two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments as a reply to Indian nuclear experiments.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that the test of the Atom Bomb which Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998, was made with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reeds was questioned that China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan then he said in reply that because India was a common enemy for Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that there is a proof to this too that Doctor Abdul Qadeer Khan used Chinese design and after this the documents which were acquired from Libia also confirms this statement.</seg>

     <seg id="2">One can bear ones self, but..</seg>
     <seg id="3">Consequences of noises.</seg>
     <seg id="4">many of us who live in large towns and cities have grown used to working in noise which comes from several different sources. There is the noise of moving trains which is heard at almost all hours of the day.</seg>
     <seg id="5">The Jet planes that fly over head produce noise of even greater loudness and intensity.</seg>
     <seg id="6">Most of us have no time to think of noises on one type or another.</seg>
     <seg id="7">They become part of our daily lives.</seg>
   </p>

   <p>
     <seg id="1">But there is something to be thought of-does noise affect our lives in some harmful ways.</seg>
     <seg id="2">already there is evidence that it does so in several ways. It has been recognized for a long time.</seg>
     <seg id="3">Now that exposure to noise high intensity leads to loss of hearing. There have been cases of boiler-makers, for example, whose suffer from occupational deafness.</seg>
     <seg id="4">More recently it has also been found that people who are continuously exposed to other loud noises require protection of the ear.</seg>
     <seg id="5">If we live in industrial areas which are growing with every passing year, there is the deafening noise produced by the speakers in house or shops, radio sets in the neighborhood, school children at play or at chorus practice of arithmetical tables, and so on.</seg>
     <seg id="6">MQM is i coalation with government, Muslim League(N) is secret partnership with government and Muslim League(Q) is the party that passed 17Th ammendment, then how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17Th Amendment</seg>
     <seg id="7">This is the way to get ones name entered in the list of martyrs by just getting painted.</seg>
     <seg id="8">The Peoples Party is otherwise not in hurry to end the seventeenth ammendment.</seg>
     <seg id="9">How any one can think of getting his own hands cut.</seg>
     <seg id="10">Seventeenth Ammendment cannot be abolished till Zardari is the President.</seg>
     <seg id="11">This was the opinion of majority in one of our survey and it is also correct.</seg>
     <seg id="12">Zardari would not have opted to be the President, if seventeenth ammendment was to be abolished.</seg>
     <seg id="13">Now he is more powerful than President Musharraf, since along with President he is also  the chairman of Peoples Party.</seg>
     <seg id="14">The seventeenth ammendment is there till he is the president.</seg>
     <seg id="15">Political Parties will have to remove President Zardari first, in order to abolish  the seventeenth ammendment.</seg>
     <seg id="16">This is not the will of MQM nor of other parties.</seg>

     <seg id="1">In our family, most of the people are of the laborer type.</seg>
     <seg id="2">And in our childhood, when we used to see our uncles toil, we used to wish in our hearts that Allah save us from labor that is hard on the body.</seg>
     <seg id="3">To save ourselves from this, we wrote a letter to the editor of the Amroz daily, asking him what we can do after metric to save ourselves from having to toil.</seg>
     <seg id="4">The editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and take such and such subjects.</seg>
     <seg id="5">My focus was always on engineering, and after metric, instead of Biology, I took Technical Drawing.</seg>
     <seg id="6">But while entering the FSC, my elder brother forced me to do FSC in medicine and become a doctor.</seg>
     <seg id="7">I studied Biology for a month with great difficulty, and when I still could not understand anything, I took maths as a subject instead.</seg>
     <seg id="8">So the scare of having to work made me an engineer, and today I am in a very good condition compared to many of my same aged relatives, for which I am always thanking Allah.</seg>
     <seg id="9">I remembered this when I was trying to lift the carpet of my old house along with my two young sons.</seg>
     <seg id="10">It was not half an hour since we started working, that the younger son said "Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job"</seg>
     <seg id="11">We said, if that is true, then study a lot like us, and free yourself from bodily pain.</seg>
     <seg id="12">The son said that I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work.</seg>
     <seg id="13">Anyway, the three of us finished that work in three hours and returned.</seg>
     <seg id="14">My purpose of saying this is that if a person has set a goal, whatever be the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving his goal.</seg>
     <seg id="15">But if you do not even know what you have to do, then Allah alone is your protector.</seg>

     <seg id="1">They say that you should not speak bad about the dead, but what can I do, even after one year of Benazir's death, I can only see faults in her.</seg>
     <seg id="2">For personal interests, Benazir handed over the list of Sikhs who were fighting for independence to India, at the same time crushing the Sikhs independence movement and also allowing India to transfer its complete attention to Pakistan, having taken care of the Punjab movement.</seg>
     <seg id="3">The Russia wars in the regimes of Benazir and Nawaz Sherif have become a part of history, which pushed the country many years back.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Benazir continued to speak ill about Kashmir and the atomic program throughout exile.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Benazir Bhutto struck a deal with Musharraf, going against her London Treaty with Nawaz Sharif</seg>
     <seg id="6">Benazir allowed her husband to openly earn money, in her era, which is why he came to be known as Mr. Ten Percent.</seg>
     <seg id="7">In Benazir's era, her brother was killed, and his killer is still not been punished.</seg>
     <seg id="8">Despite being a woman, Benazir avoided fighting for women rights.</seg>
     <seg id="9">In a way similar to how Benazir did politics on her father's corpse, her widower husband is now doing politics on her corpse.</seg>
     <seg id="10">Benazir came to power twice, but let alone bring the people guilty for the political killing of her father to justice, she could not even file a case against them.</seg>

     <seg id="1">From General Musharraf's initial few steps, it looked as if the nation would be freed of useless politicians, but the love for power changed all his plans.</seg>
     <seg id="2">Whatever expectations were, after joining the 'war of terror', he began to consider himself irremovable.</seg>
     <seg id="3">And whatever steps were expected were no more.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Just as Bush's rule began to close, he started to worry about the end of his own rule, and he struck a deal with thieves in the dark.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Even then, General Musharraf could have commanded the army, but the present government does not even know what is happening.</seg>
     <seg id="6">Whether in Bajod or Swat, the army cannot control terror, and instead they bomb the 'enemy', i.e. the public. Apart from loss of life and money, if they are making the 'enemy' psychologically ill, then we are the enemies, aren't we?</seg>

     <seg id="1">The conditions in the  terrorism struck area Swat in the Frontier Province are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area</seg>
     <seg id="2">On the one side the governments writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side the effect of Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everday in Swat.</seg>
     <seg id="3">On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.</seg>
     <seg id="4">The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.</seg>
     <seg id="5">The result is that on the one side the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other hand the Taliban has established their hold.</seg>
     <seg id="6">In between who got grinded, the poor citizens.</seg>
     <seg id="7">It is said that in Swat somebody asked, which type of people are the Taliban's are? The answer was  "very good people because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country".</seg>
     <seg id="8">Then asked how is Army, the answer was that the Army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.</seg>

     <seg id="2">Are Punjabi, Pathan, White, Black, Mahsood and other tribes the result of religion?</seg>
     <seg id="3">No, sir, no way! Only religion teaches that there is no black and white, there is no Punjabi and no immigrant. If it were not for religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between the white and the black, and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribe-brotherhood hatred.</seg>
