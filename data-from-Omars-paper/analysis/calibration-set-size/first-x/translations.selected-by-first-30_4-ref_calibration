Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News, that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Thomas Reid said that due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Among the factors are the design of the bomb, and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.

Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961, Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test, in response to which America took 17 days to preform a test, despite having this bomb for a long time.
He further said that the test of the Atom Bomb which Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998, was made with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.
When Thomas Reeds was questioned that China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan then he said in reply that because India was a common enemy for Pakistan and China.
He said that there is a proof to this too that Doctor Abdul Qadeer Khan used Chinese design and after this the documents which were acquired from Libia also confirms this statement.
On a one more question that doing combined nuclear tests is common then he said that in 1990 America conducted a nuclear test for Britain on open belt in Nevada desert.
He said that we guess that too that Israel was given access to the results of this test.
Thomas Reed was also questioned that Is the Chinese Nuclear spread program is continuing?
On this Thomas Reed said that china has been supplying raw material, instructions and design to nuclear facility in Iran's city Isfahan since 1990.
Other than that china also provided Iran a nuclear enrichment plant.

Protest against the removal of journalists
On Tuesday the organization of journalists, RIUJ held protests in front of the Islamabad Press Club of journalists and newspaper workers against media owners and the government about the news channel and newspapers removing many of their employees.
Speaking to the protesters, senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, Federal Union of Journalists,  C.R. Shamsi said that the politicians who used to protest with us till yesterday on the streets, today they have become rulers and are sitting in the parliament. Fearing a certain lobby of the media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of the journalists.
He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of Rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.
An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.
He said that there should be firm steps taken against the TV and newspaper owners, and the journalists should put a protest camp in front of the parliament to get their rights.
C.R. Shamsi criticized the governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, saying that employees were removed from his Urdu Newspaper 'Aaj Kal' staff, without prior notice.
Wheras Junah daily, Khabrein daily, Channel 5, Burns Plus TV and Aaj TV have removed dozens of workers.
Speaking to the protestors, the General Secretary of PUFJ said that today, throughout the country, journalist organizations are observing a black day against the removal of journalists and newspaper workers, whereas journalists will go to the parliamentary session wearing black bands on their arms to get back their rights.
According to Mazhar Abbas, in 50% of the Pakistani newspapers and TV channels the workers and journalists were being exploited, where they work without any agreement.
He said that till now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been removed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is being feared that the owners will remove hundreds more in the present year, making an excuse of the present financial crisis.
Mazhar Abbas said that the journalist movement will continue, until removed employees are not reinstated, the newspaper workers wages fixed by the seventh Wage board award is not enforced, and the salaries for many months payable to TV channels and newspaper workers is not paid.

The role of European Union for the peace in Middle East
Officially European Union plays a decisive role in the mediatory efforts taken for stopping the war in Middle East.
According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of Sarkozy are helping hands in this process.
European Union spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said every single step which may help in delivering the conjoint message of European Union to fighting parties is appreciable.
Officially everything seems fine.
But in fact European Union is portraying a picture of internal tension, stress and strain.
The role of Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak
plus internal affairs has made her helpless.
On the other hand the course of action of French President Sarkozy depicts that France is still the President of European Union.
Although 6 months Presidency tenure of France is over.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role which he is capable of, but he isn't the authority.
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner is facing the funniest side.
He is in the delegation which is led by Schwarzenberg the Foreign Minister of Czech Republic.
In addition to that, the two foreign ministers are giving different statements on the war in Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend herself, while according to Kouchner war is not the defense. Germany has also sent a special ambassador to Middle East. As long as European Union does not show unanimous stand, she can not be successful on diplomatic front.
The prove is the no lift conduct of Israel to mediatory efforts of European Union.
This is the best time for European Union to prove herself, as America has failed in Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.

Adolf Marclay, resident of Swabia in south Germany has left behind a huge industrialist group.
But he was not known to German public a while back.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks for weeks regarding his debts towards industrial groups, he became the hot news and could see the dark future for Marckay group.
Marclay Group had to bear the loss of hundreds of million euros after it bought the shares of one of known industry Folks Wigan.
then the financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed 100 Million and 1 billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on Marclay.
Recently the same banks accepted to provide loan to Marclay group on urgent basis but Adolf Marclay who started as a small industrialist to reach a place where his industrial group's annual income reached 30 billion euros, couldn't bear the the loss in his financial strength.
After the death of his father when Adolf Marclay took the responsibility of the business he used modern methods and made the business more successful.
He named his company Ratiopharm which is now Germany's most successful and biggest pharmaceutical company.
Till recent times this phamasutical company had a budget of around 5 to 6 billion euros and even now it is earning around 8 billion euros annually. After the great success of Rasue farm the Marclay Group bought many big industries like Hi-Del Barag Cement a manufacture of construction equipment. Kassbohrer and other good car maker
Marclay Group has a employee number of around 100 thousand around the world and among its industries, Rasue Farm has always been given special importance.
Adolf Marclay has said this many times in his life. ""We have been in pharma business since four generations"".
Now the industry is handled by the children and i hope that it continues to work for few hundred years by our family.
After the suicide of Adolf Marclay,the banks have given approval of temporary loan of 400 million euro for his group VEM but on this condition that VEM have to be sold to  Rasio Farm so that the financial position of this group is improved on long term basis.

According to recent statistics the crime rate of foreigners between 2004 to 2007 .22
9 percent has reduced to .21
4 percent.
According to Joachim Herrmann the Interior Minister of Bavaria it is only an apparent positive change.
He said: It must be considered that foreigners having the German citizenship are increasing.
So it must be added in the statistics that though the criminal is a German citizen but his background is foreigner.
Herrmann said that from 2010 his state will keep this fact in mind while collecting the data of criminals.
Other than Bavaria, Hemberg is also working on same pattern.
Senator Christoph Ahlhaus of Interior ministry from CDU said:"" When the scientific research is conducted one can not draw results of his own rather they depend on the data which is calculated after research.
Ahlhaus presented an analysis report of provincial office of crime management prepared in 2006, according to which in the Bergdorf area of Hemberg the percentage of foreigners in the crimes committed there was calculated.
Results indicate that here foreigners
crime rate is less then the crimes committed in the whole province.
On the contrary during 2006 when youth crime rate in Berlin was observed revealed that the youth having the foreign background was .44
7 percent.
Other political parties of Germany like SPD, clean atmospherics party Greens, and leftist party Linkspartei are against the of gathering information whether the background of a German citizen is foreign while collecting the data about crimes.

In these regards, German Chancellor, Angela Merchel also expressed reliance on the new American President.

Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that Obama seems a serious and open hearted person, and this is definitely something good.
As such, the previous American president's policies were subject to criticism.
However, his government is definitely credited with arousing China into playing a more constructive role on the international level, whereas, with regards to the new president, China has said that he will have to work for strong military ties between the countries.
Expert on Chinese politics, who is active in Bokhum, Germany, Gosuwe Hu, says:
From this viewpoint, I am certain that Obama and his economic team will, within the coming weeks and months, pressurize the Beijing government into pegging the Chinese currency to a stable and market representing exchange rate.
The previous American government also increased ties with India.
About where Obama might take those ties, Professor Christopher Raj, expert on American sciences in New Delhi, says that we are now closer to a strategic partnership, but Obama cannot make any change overnight.

Why reduction in exercise with increase in the age
New Research
Exercise is good for health in every age
This keeps the heart healthy,reduces the level of cholesterol,Helps in keeping the weight low, helps in reduction of sugar and reduces Alzheimer meaning decreases the speed of dementia.
Unfortunately, in many people with the increase in the age, the capability to carryout exercise also decreases.
The specialists say that with exercise our body and brain remain active but age can have effect on it.
The American Medical Association says that Many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out.
Dr. Pattricia P. Leka of Maya clinic Minnesota says that increase in age is a big reason for being handicapped from exercise and less physical activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo clinic.
She headed a research regarding heart diseases and man's ability to do exercise in older age.
Team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart.
In which heart's activity of pumping blood and its contraction and relaxation was studied.
Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.
They came to know that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.
Dr. Patricia says with increase in age, problems occur in the activity of relaxation of heart and with increase in age, this effects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research
He says that we were surprised to see that it has an effect  and it confirmed that bad exercising ability is very much related to the heart relaxing activity.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.
If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart, they can achieve the benefits of excercise, despite the increase in age.
A detailed report of this has been published in the magazine of the American Medical Association.

May God answer the world's prayers and may Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, but we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan , effected by this change, are in our favor.
That what will Mr. Barrack Obama give to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams.
Obama's (whose name has Hussein also), oath as a President of America on one hand is historical while on the other hand is a hard test too
not only for him but for all those people who has supported him heartily.
This will also be a test for white people majority as it is not easy for them to accept heartily the presidency of black on them.
Here in Southern Asia specially Muslims who have developed expectation from him must remember that he has been elected as President of America and Obama must remember that President of America is Practically the president of the whole world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have to have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, so this will be a win for people who love him.
What will be its effect on South Asia and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan.

Dear, whether it is Obama or some one else, the decision of the policy of the entire world is done by Jews lobby of  billionaires, influencing, powerful and effective people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts,the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is in front of everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat, who had a regular Army and Law.
He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a  pact
but it is matter of sorrow that our government treated Swat like a step mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government of the ruler of Swat.
and no interest was taken in the building and development works
The girls who are getting education today are much lesser in number than  those who used to get educated in the previous era.
In the Frontier Province, there is a continuous targeting of educational institutions by Taliban's.
The maximum number of schools have been destroyed in district Swat in which majority are the girls schools.
It is not just this, the Taliban has imposed a ban on girl education.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.
What do you think Talibans wants to achieve by stopping women education.
Why the government has failed to stop these illegal actions?
In your opinion what government should do.
Question must be this that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
Because Swat people has understand the game that army is there to serve Taliban not to kill them otherwise how five schools can be destroyed in a single night during curfew, how people can be butchered and hanged in the square.
When government writ is unable to implement in Swat in these circumstances how the government will succeed in eliminating these illegal activities.
Now the question is when government has every thing like armed force, latest weapons, latest technology and spy system then why these Taliban can;t be controlled?
The only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught.
The essence is that these Taliban are paving the path for 'International Imperialism' by their bad deeds.
15 years ago, the war was on in Afghanistan.
ISI is controlling Taliban when at that time opponent was north coalition who was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly situation changed, actions of Taliban began to appear.
And ISI was also offered Dollars from America so past friends became enemies.
Now situation is this that war continues but helping in Pakistan are still those Iran, India and Russia.
Unless this feeling does not emerge in Human that what is right and wrong till then Human will keep doing mistakes.
As an example a thief when goes to steal if he at that time gets this thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse, there is also punishment in it and he fears from God then that Human will not steal.
Same like this that unless Israel do not gets this apprehension that i am doing wrong and draining blood of innocents and i will get punishment for this, he will keep playing Holi with the blood innocents of Gaza till then.
Respects!
Question is that is war, armed movement, terrorism is solution to problems?
If not then what is the specific prescription which takes to the solution of the problems?
This is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but rather it puts 'blessings' in them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development, that Nelson Mandela had used in South Africa.
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
From the Kashmiris taking part in the elections, it looks as if they have accepted this view point.
It is the third week of Israeli attacks on Gaza and the number of deaths have gone close to a thousand.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date, a ceasefire was not possible.
According to another report, since the start of attacks, on the 27th of December, 90,000 Palestinians have left their homes and moved towards safer locations.
Here, aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, and said that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victim of grave psychological and emotional difficulties.
What do you say?
What should happen?
How is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Give Taliban a Chance.
Basit, Peshawar
Wake up! If Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down girls schools?
And kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
These Taliban has damaged Islam so much that no other nation or religion has done.
Pushtun force
Kohat, Pakistan
If the whole Islamic world just threat Israel for launch of attack you will see that in how much pain father of Israel America will be in
and not only talks about real ceasefire rather ceasefire will be accomplished.
But what to do our Muslim leaders lack the courage greatly.
Some one ask Ahmadinejad to take the initiative because your bravery is very popular in BBC Forum.
The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights falls not only upon the Arabs, or the Muslims of the world, but rather it is the duty of all the nations in the world that they speak up against oppression.
This troubling incident is one of the worst misdeeds of Bush yet.
Similar to how, in Pakistan and India, on the 30th of June, that is before the close of the financial year, the government institutions are looted, in the same way, before the winding up of the American government, Israel was given the green signal to do whatever it wants.
On one hand, America says that it will try for a ceasefire.
On the other side, the United Nation is passing one resolution over another but both have done nothing practically, this means that united nation is also working  to crush the Muslims.
All the Islamic Countries should cancel their membership of United Nations and they should lay the foundation of there own international organisation.
Many examples are in front of us, where only promises and resolutions of America and United Nations came forward but only the Muslims suffered.
What is the advantage of these actions when BBC does not have to print anything.
Now, where have the principles of general ism been buried,When the unrequired blood especially of the Muslims starts flowing, at that time the ghost of unbiased reporting starts riding over the BBC.
Otherwise portrays itself as flag bearer of righteousness.
Saying something from their side is a far away thing, they do not want even comments
from the Muslims.
The difference between you and Jews is that they call themselves Jews and Martyr the Muslims and people like you live among Muslims, by calling themselves Muslims, to Muslims
[syja786]
For a long time on BBC forums, sometimes suicide bombing and other times terrorism in India was used to target a certain sect.
The favorite word of these Anti-Islamic discussions was Extremism.
You can get a very good idea, about who an extremist is, from the above discussion in which, writing against Iran was almost considered blasphemy.
When will our muslims understand that Anti Christ can not be fought with swords.
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what shall one do other than crying?
But the basic fault is of this turmoil and massacre which by naming Jihad, we try to blacken the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of Palestinians accepted the existence of Israel then why did Hammas need to fire those rockets on Israel and made suicide attacks?
Attitude of the both the sides is against humanity.
The role of UN and the USA was again seen as favoring towards the injustice of Israel.
May Allah give muslim nation the understanding of becoming  united. Ameen!
As a matter of fact,think about giving Noble Prise to terrorists for carrying out this painful terrorist activity, as a campaign against terrorism, eventually the actual work is being done by them.
Otherwise, is it possible to carryout terrorist activity on such a massive scale without the assistance of Chiefs and  every one knows who are pulling their strings.
In such a situation it can be termed as high handedness "Do what ever you can".
The strong mans fist,it beats over the head and do not let one cry.
The Arab rulers are giving medicines for the injured,Funeral clothing's for the dead and money and they are asking
should the Israelis continue attacks?
The actual problem is that the rulers of Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia are dreaming undutiful while asleep,Neither they have army nor they have defence plans,they just think that by providing aid they have done their duty.
They should immediately take practical steps against the Israel
like cutting of oil supply to European countries and America, but sorry for them.
Regards to all brothers and sisters
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is similar to considering them defeated.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature, as the steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Israel and Hamas should enter a truce so that the death and destruction can come to an end.
Mohammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France
Absolutely correctly stated
Supposing that Hamas is 100% on the truth, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah. Even then, they should know that if a good deed is resulting in the destruction of an established house, it is no more a good deed.
Those who claim to love God, love the messenger and love their religion, loving mankind is a part of their faith.
As if it is the order of Allah to evacuate all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than the Muslims.
Najeeb-ur-Rahman Psycho *Lahore* [Pakian]
No! It is not decreed to annihilate but it is decreed to invite people to Islam.
But people who do conspiracies against the religion, it is decreed to do Jihad against them.
One should fight with them until they finish their conspiracies. But this certainly does not mean that they can wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the consequence of a murderer of children is disaster.
But its a request to my friends that yesterday Israelis did not have a roof over their heads and today they are so strong that they do not listen to anyone because all Jews are one.
They do not have Shiite nor Sunni, all are just Jews. And they have succeeded in every field and made everything.
Opposite to this, what is the condition of 55 Islamic Countries?
Lagging in every field and now the condition is this that they are so helpless that enemies are killing them and they are waiting for their death.
Point required is that all Muslim countries should get together and should make a plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better course of action than accepting Israel. Learn new technology and ways of success from them and let the world live in peace.
Muslims have great land and resources.
The need is correct usage.
First of all, the most tragic part is that Hammas and Alfatah could not be united.
The only reason to destroy great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin was to weaken the only nation fighting for Aqsa Mosque. And it was impossible until Yasir and Yasin were removed from the way.
The world is watching that how Palestine was falling down every second after the death of these two leaders.
And  how this lobby of jews strengthened their target by every moment.
In 1974 a Pakistani Prime Minister was of such an International trust that first time in history he united all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance.
Today on his 81st birthday is it hard enough for the nation to promise for unity with each other
but by eliminating the differences between other Muslims will accomplish its (establishment of Islamic Common Wealth) incomplete mission.
This is a Jinn, which has entered Palestine for half a century.
That Jinn has many mouths.
Many a times, this Jinn calls itself bad names from one of its other mouths to divert the attention and reduce the pressure of the world from it.
It is another mouth of this Jinn whichis eating people in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This Jinn fears Islam the most, as it knows that whenever it is removed, only Islam, Mulsims and the complete religion of Islam being followed practically, in its followers can remove it, as history proves that Islam has brought many Abu Jahls to the path.
The series of bombings of Gaza by Israeli war planes and missile strikes has been going on since the 27th of December.
More than three hundred Israeli citizens have died so far in these attacks.
Now, after the air strikes, Israeli tanks have reached the Gaza border, completely prepared to launch a land offensive.
The Security Council of the United Nations, through an agreed upon resolution passed in an emergency meeting, have demanded that Israeli and Palestinian authorities stop extremist activities immediately.
However, Israeli officials claim that they will continue their action in Gaza until they are convinced that Israel will be safe from rocket attacks.
In your opinion, is the statement by Israel, that this is an Israeli struggle for safety, acceptable?
In this situation, is the global brotherhood doing its job?
Can this inhumane action have a direct relation with the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can there be any expectation of improvement in the Middle East situation, after newly elected president Barack Obama takes office?

Palestine is a holy land for the Muslims, all over the world, and protecting it is a necessary duty for us.
We should also remember that it was our first Qiblah.
And Israel, America and India have to disappear one day, as they are made only to be destroyed, and Allah will definitely destroy the disbelievers. Sajid Sadiq, Lahore.
"When has the night of loneliness been spent shedding tears,
When has a calamity been averted only by supplication" (Nawab Zadah Nasrullah Khan)
Such reviews are anxiously telecasted by BBC.
After all the image and prestige of neutralism has to be kept.
Though BBC news are often true but the real thing is the delivery.
What to highlight and which news is given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
Now In this regard our Pakistani print and electronic media, specially few Urdu newspapers and columnists etc. are not behind in the trade who in the coverage or writing of increasing terrorism exaggerate to hell.
He said that the United Nations which speaks of human rights and peace, but though the Muslims ar being oppressed greatly, you hear them say that until Hamas does not stop it's attacks, this unfair policy will continue.
Why is so much oppression being done on the Muslims? If people such as America stop supporting these Jews, then Allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support, and then see what kind of life they get.
The famous just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.
In the words of a poet
Oppression is oppression, that the more it's done the more it is erased.
Blood is blood, that the more it falls, the more it gathers.
Now who can tell who did terrorism?
Is all this not included in terrorism? Why does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocent not red?
And why is there no one to send a mourning message from anywhere?
I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.
Dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood, how shall we condemn, I can not find words!
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims that on one side people are being killed in India so the rest of the world comes over Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations otherwise we will do it ourselves!
And on the other side, Israel is killing generations of muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent. This is unbearable!
There is delay but not NEVER in the house of God and only then will this darkness shed. Then
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Considering elections, the rulers should do such activities for people's support. There is no doubt in this specially when countries like Israel exist. Rest talking about Barrack Obama, then history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy and nor will do it. Regime, whether black or white, is a regime.
It appears from the conversation of forum that everyone is grieved over Benazir death but as politician her mistakes are not forgotten.
It is debatable that Benazir died for democracy or for power.
If she sacrificed for democracy then why she left democracy in the dictatorship of Musharraf for 10 years till she got a deal and American clearance?
Benazir did not return Pakistan when dictatorship affected people needed her she returned Pakistan when she has the assurances of free from cases and of power.
when each and every historic personality is being accused, there is no one to say any thing over this.
Sana Khan
few things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done of them.
another reader.
Sir/Sir probably you should not only study Pakistan's history but that of 4 friend and 7 other countries, may be you would agree with Psycho's point of view.
Tariq Ayaz
'those who don't have a good nature can't be corrected through training'
living green in the water made the reflection of the wheat plant look like a cypress.
Britain never let them unite and established the Hindu-Muslim conflict which was later on brought up by Sir Syed.
Psycho
How merciless is our nation. We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.
We have succeeded a lot!
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar if you en wreathe him with books.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks but Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.
If they talk about war then both the sides will suffer human loss.
India says that Pakistani citizen is caught in Bombay attacks. And he has written and sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. But earlier, when India caught this extremist, said that he is a smart engineer but later they declared him to have studied only four grades. This is what has to be considered.
First of all, merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and  all christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
We want flowers of peace rather in the flame of war.
War is itself a problem.
What solution will the war give?
Today will give Fire and blood.
Tomorrow will give hunger and necessity.
For this wise people
it is better that war keeps postponing.
In your and our garden
it is better that candle keeps lit.
The relationship of India America have become deep and India knows that when the time comes America will openly deceive Pakistan.
This is that old history of America.
Because in the case of an Indian attack, America's goals will also be fulfilled and the expenses will be India's.
Pakistan should clearly announce that it will not start, but if injury is caused, there will be no talks of peace or truce, and the war will not stop until India is completely destroyed or captured, even if it involves our destroying ourselves.
This is Islamic history.
Before this resolution Pakistani people and army has delivered their message.
Indian struggle for having unusual diplomatic and military benefits in compensation of Mumbai attacks are proving her cunning party then affected. Therefore the world has reduced its pressure on Pakistan contrasting to its initial hard reaction.
UN has expressed faith on Pakistani efforts ignoring the unnecessary lamentation of India and Interpol's appreciation of Pakistani efforts is the 'side effect' of unwanted Indian diplomacy.
There is no two opinions about this being a very beastly action.
But the question is, that when thousands of Taliban were attacking Pir Samiullah's town, where was the Pakistani Army, and what were they doing?
Should the army not be taken into account, as to what they did there for one year?
Every day, how many Taliban die due to the firing of the thousands of mortar and canon shells they fire?
I appeal to the ICI that they stop their guardianship of the Taliban, for Gods sake, and let us live peacefully in paradise like Swat.
And they stop this fixed operation.
The day is not far when in UN resolution of Army intrusion in Pakistan will be approved just like the one against Jamat Aldawa.
Riaz Ahmed Farooqi
First our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in UN,
and suppose if this resolution took time to approve then considering the example of America any country will launch the attack at her own.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
As the bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are immortal even after they die.
But there is a international game being played here in which place public is ruled by frightening through barbarism and ferociousness.
So that license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will clutch the government.
These acts of so called Islamic activists on the name of religion is without limit worthy of condemnation.
These supporters of extremists can see the injustice of America but instead of expressing grieve on those dishonest acts they clearly shun them by giving them name of tribal traditions.
Sometimes by cloaking in tribal traditions, sometimes on the name of Islam, any pious man cannot give reason for such dishonest acts.
In my view, our Army people are associated with theses people.
As such that when these people move from a place then it takes such time that they can be caught, there should be time for that but its a stretch that they get there on time even if they are there, they are long gone.
Are they so merciless that they kidnap fifty seventy men and our Army putting hand on hand looks at them like a spectator.
They are servant of Allah and  so is Army.
It is very clear that there is fishy.
instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and lesson gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell,
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Who burnt the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on the refusal of oath after the Prophet (PBUH) passed away and how took her husband by the rope in his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
Was the attack on Medina by the the Army of Yazid and and the incident of Karbala was the conspiracy of Jews and Pagans?
Without accepting the facts, neither motives can be removed nor these can be corrected?
BBC people, stop this dual policy.
The better super hit title than this is:  the beating  of Bush with shoes is right or wrong?
this should have been the topic.
Tahir Chowdary, Japan
Be ashamed, the body of a person was taken out of the grave and hanged on a pole because he spoke against the cruelty and you are struck up over the topic of Box Office.
The success of operation Sherdil and across the border the success of operation Lion Heart depends on the direction of sympathies of common folk.
This step is of American and Pakistani intelligence agencies and Pir Sahib is the victim of this conspiracy
All the comments on this forum would be against the Taliban because intelligence agents have successfully infiltrated in the Taliban ranks and they are carrying out such actions that can change their perception of people.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public. They even report something like this 'Bombing on Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000, in Swat went there to do.
That the bodies of the Taliban who helps the army is left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake stop this drama.
These Talibans have tarnished the Muslim image.
If in the whole world true Muslims don't call these terrorists as Muslims then how come these elements are able to live in the lands of true Muslims.
Those who become shameless, can't do hard labor they pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
There is no allowance of this in any religion or family traditions.
Including BBC all the media present their views in different styles on Taliban or the tribal people.
But no one is aware of the ground realities or what the truth is. It is us the tribal people who know what rally is the matter.
In short, its a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a talib or a tribal. Who made these institutions? Warmongers who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions.
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute the leader of MQM, Althaf Husain, and the leaderships of ANP and PPP, as they have spoken against this cancer, i.e. the Taliban.
This cancer was given birth to by Zia-ul-Haqq. He has gone, but he has destroyed Pakistan as he went.
But I have hope that the present government will eradicate this cancer.
After Mumbai attacks India said that few extremist groups are involved in these attacks.
Pakistan denied these blames and said that she will fully cooperate in the investigation.
India said that she has provided Pakistan a list of 20 extremists, who are wanted to India.
Noe Pakistan said that leader of Jaish e Muhammad Maulana Masud Azhar present in this list is not detained and Government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before this President Asif Ali Zardari has denied the impression that Western Secret Agencies and Indian Government have provided Pakistan the proves of Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said about Ajmal Qasab that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
During this Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that Indian relation with her can't get better till the time her soil is used for terrorism.
And in recent updates Indian Cricket team has canceled its tour of Pakistan.
Should these political incidents affect sports?
How do you see the future of Pakistan and India relations?
Neither America nor India will break Pakistan.
Pakistan will break itself.
With so much regionalism, factionism and infiltration, what else can you expect?
Time has proved that Jinnah did not do good to the Indian Muslims.
Yasmin, Chicago
Madam, if work was continued in Jinnah's manner, neither would the tumors of regionalism, factionism and infiltration have spread in Pakistan, nor would the Indian Muslims been treated in this way.
but it's our fault that we could not bring up a leader like his stature.
if we can not care for our heroes, then
this region has great capabilities.
god knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
in both countries the enemies to peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv sena, RSS have been raised.
and the evil powers don't want this region to progress therefore these countries are controlled like puppets.
can you imagine what status will this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world.
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
may Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
but Sir, open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
Other than that National matter are not looking good as well, circumstances in Sarhad, Balochistan, Karachi in Sindh are in front of you.
In this situation country needs a such leader who can unite us as a single Nation.
O Allah Have mercy on us
In my opinion there is no way other than a last war.
Enough much has happened
Now this affair has to win or lose.
This problem will not solve with hypocrisy deceit.
And neither with small big terrorism in each other countries.
Even Europe too came to rest after fighting the last great war.
And if this Great war had not happened then they all would be chattering like Pakistan and India.
Almost all of our political parties agree on this matter that these terrorist and denominational activities should be terminated from the country.
But our army rule does not seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, American and Europe are made to believe that we are with you on this war against terrorism and the other hand, we also help Taliban secretly.
We have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way. Thank you.
There is no doubt in this that majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are the members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined  the party  named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.
Although these members preferred subsidiary activities and now after India's great persistence, The United Nation has invalidated it also and Government of Pakistan is continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it is better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
Terrorist groups present in Pakistan, who support professional criminals and the heads of those Mullahs are those who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.
And now they are doing everything to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called Human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan from these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous or not?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose work is only to kill.
Heart is breaking into pieces on this news.
What world is this where it is hard to survive for the one who names an important part of Allah's religion Islam.
Non Muslims can kill Muslim, but if Muslim even tries to take revenge then along with the whole non Muslim world our hypocrite leaders also treat the ones sincere with true and sincere religion like they are treating our great leader Hafiz Saeed now a days.
As a penalty of Mumbai attacks India.
Pakistan relations are affected, and the recent improvement of relations between two countries is enormously shocked.
India has been continually blaming active armed and unarmed groups in Pakistan
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the action against these groups.
Whereas Indian Security agencies has directly blamed Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks
, in this regard Jamat Adawa has also been nominated.
It is not the first time that because of any terrorist attack the relation of these two countries are worsen.
In December 2000 after the attacks on Indian Parliament both countries were at the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashkr e Taiba was banned and was included in terrorists list.
Now Jamat Adawa, to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of Lashkr e Taiba, is demanded to be banned.
What do you think, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against active extremist groups on her soil?
Can by banning Jamat Adawa present India,
Pakistan crisis will vanish and to what extent it is vital to ban armed groups for establishing forever peace between the two countries.
Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly?
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful state.
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salute, sir, salute happily, but get your work done on your own.
Do not do it under the pressure from America.
If India is in difficulty, let them prove it, no?
Why does it not give?
And why do they accuse us with everything?
There are fundamentalist groups and organisations, even in India. Why does no one put any restrictions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the whole world?
What is it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What is it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the first Islamic Nuclear State. Why, is what the fight is about.
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart and circumstances also seems to be such
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be the part of this conspiracy.
American are not slowly but now very swiftly tightening there grip over Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances,if we as a nation does not display unity and solidarity then if Bangladesh can be created,anything else can also happen.
More the terrorism is condemned lessor it is , whether it is in a Hotel at Mumbai or it is in Marriott Hotel Islamabad or it is in Palestine.
Like wise irrespective of the origin of the terrorist, these should be eliminated, no matter these are Pakistanis or Indian or American or Israelite.
Now the question is that why the whole world including the Pakistani officials are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack carried out on Marriott Hotel was not a terrorist attack?
Then why?
Praise the worthy Advisor interior,Mister Rehman Malik,by the grace of God, how brave he has become!

Not only this , according to the BBC Mister Malik has also tried to negate this impression with full strength that all these imprisonments are being carried out on whose orders.
Praise the lord!
Having this capability or not, this I don't want to say.
Whose war we Pakistanis are fighting
and why. We have our own priorities which we shall protect with our full strength.
Nobody has an authority to interfere in any other country.
Apparently colonial period does not seem to exist.
If people expect justice, or demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan, which I think is not acceptable by those calling for unity.
As such, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
And this causes more opposing feelings.
If they trust America and the United republics, then let them leave the style of new populations, and let them work on those lines, upholding the sovereignty of the state.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
Security forces raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
Pressure is being increased on Pakistan for taking rapid action against extremist organizations after Mumbai attacks.
India blames Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Secretary Condolisa Rice asked Pakistani leadership to take practical measures for instant and transparent action against the responsible s of Mumbai attacks.
She says that no doubt the extremists responsible for Mumbai attacks used Pakistani soil.
During this Peshawar Government says that unknown armed persons has set another truck stand for supply of goods to Allied Forces deployed in Afghanistan on fire, due to which more then fifty vehicles are destroyed.
It is the second attack on Neto and American supplies during 48 hours in Peshawar.
During this Pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from Karachi to Tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action.
It is revealed that during the reign of General Zia ul Huq because of the invasion of the ex USSR in Afghanistan and its resistance started by the American and Saudi funding resulted in the birth of armed groups of which Pakistan unable to terminated could not get back herself to the era before 1980s.
The question is does Pakistan want to do it?
Is Pakistan capable of doing this?
What do you think?

I have only one question for the standard bearers of the world.
If you kill their children, will they come to garland you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill innocent public, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in negative, then you really need to fix your viewpoint.
Peoples were armed at that time it was feared that after Afghanistan, Russia will attack Pakistan so people were armed.
Now when there is the danger of American attack via Afghanistan of which current American President clearly expressed in his presidential campaign then why should we disarm these people?
Only for this that after defeating Pakistani Army America or India may not face any public resistance?
Yes, if any of them is involved in sabotage activities then only Pakistan should take action against him.
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
And another question is that were these terrorists not supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As for as Lashkr e Taiba is concerned ongoing terrorism is not linked to it.
It must be recalled that Hafiz Saeed was the first 'Militant Leader' who declared activities of Taliban 'revolt'.
I am quite sure that Taliban agitation is a vital part of American plans so every person or organization must be eliminated who challenges Taliban in any aspect.
Despite the cooperation of the whole nation action against Lashkr due to the pressure of India indicates the nervousness and flatterness of Zardari and Co.
To terminate the expedition started by the American and Saudi funding, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society.
Also protest them that by what ethics American and Saudis are spreaded dangerous arms and so called Jihadi but in fact the virus of  loathsome literature and culture, due to which human butcher houses established in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly. And tried its best that India should attack Pakistan.
This shattered the confidence of America in the area.
Although India did not even threatened nor it has the guts to.
And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of Taliban or American posts.
Thus it was proven that without the support of Pakistan and its army, America can not do anything.
Karachi Business Financial Center of Pakistan is Dubai of underdeveloped areas.
Hundreds of thousand never return empty pocket from here, but since the grip of law has weekend in Western Frontier areas all eyes are on Karachi.
Now they are about to kidnap this city.
First time Pathans are named Pakhtoon, residents of a city are involved in fighting like strangers, although need of the time is unity.
One possible solution to the problem is this that either Urdu speaking learn Pashto or Pashto speaking learn Urdu, or whats better is they all learn English.
You will surely think this as a ridiculous suggestion but do you think that reason of this conflict is not ridiculous?
That reason of violence is language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir i gave this suggestion  in childhood in reality to my friends in which there were people according to classification from every religion and dialect but friends used to laugh on my talks.
At that time the condition of Jinn of hatred of dialectal and religious was not that alive and strong but it was brewing internally.
Do not understand what and why is this happening?
Are these the very same signs of Last day?
For what crime are innocent and guiltless being killed?
The reasons are in front of everyone who wants to divide Pakistan in pieces same are active here and who do this they neither have religion and nor country.
Either Karachi or Mumbai it is an inside job.
Every upcoming government gets herself involved in changing the names of places, like now a days airport, roads, buildings all Benazir.
Is this the meaning of Benazir which is happening in Karachi and to the peoples of Pakistan?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awaken sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
Where reaction full of patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties have taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time they have also given American planners one more chance to think.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the worse situation in Karachi and administration is not neutral.
Administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately
, police and rangers don't take action because of political parties pressure.
To unite is only expressed in speeches, political parties should have to quit their interests and work for common people.
Till the end administration is under political pressure such incidents will increase, Allah bless Pakistan.
In my opinion, they are the biggest terrorists.
And of course there are external powers active in this. But no one knows who they are?
But what is sad the most is if this kind of situation occurred in some city of Sarhad, government would have done what not but now when it is not in Sarhad, the government is so helpless.
Government should do an operation here and save country's big and an important city.
Otherwise, Pakistan will face a big economic setback.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth being scared. On the other hand Pakistan's media's condition is even worse.
The complete truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is this that Urdu speaking people should learn Pashto or Pashto speaking people should learn Urdu or it is even better if everyone learns English.
You will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but don't you think the reason for collision is ridiculous?
that language is the reason of violence?
There was another story of cruelness recorded in Karachi, terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
Wherever one could do something, he did everything. Reports on the media are 50% of what has happened here in four days.
Stayed awake in the last four nights and still afraid.
Who evacuated hotels, killed cobblers peanut sellers.
causing depredation on Super highway and cutting off ears of the innocents are all not aware of the punishment of Allah, which will catch them one day.
In your opinion, what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
Placing in front of us the heart struck attacks of Bombay, we certainly do not have to dive to find the reasons for this disturbance in Karachi. But there is one simple and easy reason that this disturbance was the result of spilling of blood subconsciously.
It is evident that if some one will knock kneed with the father, it is not unusual for the son to get out of control.

Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan, they did not face any reaction.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
Only Muslim League (N) was left, she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to Peoples Party.
Before this MQM and Muslim League (Q) has already submitted the draft of 18th amendment in assembly and senate.
Till now it appears that 18th amendment was a political move and none of the party is sincere in its approval.
This is why nobody has raised voice in the favor of this amendment in senate or assembly and neither forced the House to approve the amendment.
It seems that by submitted the draft of 18th amendment these parties has beaten around the bushes means they can claim that we had submitted the amendment but the ruling party's speaker did not proceed.
MQM is i coalation with government, Muslim League(N) is secret partnership with government and Muslim League(Q) is the party that passed 17Th ammendment, then how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17Th Amendment
This is the way to get ones name entered in the list of martyrs by just getting painted.
The Peoples Party is otherwise not in hurry to end the seventeenth ammendment.
How any one can think of getting his own hands cut.
Seventeenth Ammendment cannot be abolished till Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of majority in one of our survey and it is also correct.
Zardari would not have opted to be the President, if seventeenth ammendment was to be abolished.
Now he is more powerful than President Musharraf, since along with President he is also  the chairman of Peoples Party.
The seventeenth ammendment is there till he is the president.
Political Parties will have to remove President Zardari first, in order to abolish  the seventeenth ammendment.
Neither MQM wants it nor the other parties.
Most elders of our family belonged to labor class.
And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.
To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.
Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.
From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.
But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.
We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.
It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God
This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.
It was not even 30 minutes for us working that our younger son said “Dad it feels like I am not born for this job.
We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.
Son started saying that I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work .
Three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home.
What it means is that when a man decides the destination no matter what were the motives behind this no one can stop him from getting it.
But if you don’t even know what you have to do then God be with you.
It is said that don't accuse the dead, but can't help it as we see only evils in her on the first anniversary of Benazir.
On one side Benazir crushed independence movement of Sikhs by handing over the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India for her own sake and on the other hand provided India an opportunity to fully concentrate in Kashmir after crushing the movement in Punjab.
The greed of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years.
During her exile Benazir continued to give negative statements on Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir made a deal with Pervez Musharraf while betraying the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif.
During her reign Benazir provided her husband the opportunity of making money and because of this he popularized as Mr. 10 percent.
Benazir brother was killed during her reign whose assassins are still safe.
Though a woman still Benazir avoided to fight for the rights of women.
Just like Benazir politicized her father's dead body similarly his widower husband politicizing her dead body.
Benazir reigned twice but not only she failed to punish her father's political murder but could not file a case against them.
It is 37 years since East Pakistan was separated from us, and look at the height of insensitivity on the part of the public and the rulers, that no one ever mourned or expressed sorrow over their mistakes.
We should have been observing 16th December as a day of reflection, and made plans to prevent the re occurrence of such incidents.
We should have been sending greetings to the people of Bangladesh on this day and been trying to bring them closer to ourselves.
The ruler should have opened the Jamudur Rahman commission file and pondered over the causes of separation of West Pakistan, mentioned therein.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Bahari's stuck in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines of life from the next day.
Only if East and West Pakistan could be one together just like East and West Germany was united once again.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be granted in the near future.
Today when it was told in the news that Governor of American State Illinois has been arrested for charges of corruption
and to remove him from governorship provincial Congress is preparing for his rapid accountability, our American friend who has a keen interest in Pakistani affairs exaggeratedly said to me 'see this is democracy'.
No one is beyond the law in America.
and here is your country Pakistan whose president was dropped of the corruption charges before sworn in.
My sense of humor rouse and I said what's strange if a governor has been arrested in America, in our Pakistan prime minister was arrested overnight and once was hanged and second time was exiled.
Tell me, has it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan the country law breaker has been departed from President House with guard of honor, tell me has it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan Chief Justice has been dismissed as despite of public support he is not reinstated yet, has this ever happened in America?
In Pakistan fake degree holder has become the Health Minister, did this happen in America?
By hearing this American laughed like mads and also accepted his defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by Americans from all sides.
It seems from his smile
that America is with his government. But he is forgetting that last year the same people was with Parvez Musharaf.
This picture was passed on, as if it was of some family.
Previously, such a photo was never printed in newspapers before, i.e. one president with three American agents.
It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.
It is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.
If it was a smart ruler, at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo, and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting.
If the rules of democracy are implemented on this photo, President Zardari is in minority.
According to democracy, the majority are the rulers of the country, and the photo is speaking for itself who that is?
Paradise-like Swat is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
According to the government tactic so far, along with force, discussions have been going on.
But the use of force is not giving any benefit other than increasing the force of the Taliban and increasing the public favor for them.
It is required that the government finish the causes of this problem, rather than use force.
By finishing the causes, Fazlullah and the Taliban will be finished themselves.
The proposed Shariah bill of the ANP government will become a moderate solution to the problems in Swat.
But alongside the establishment of the Shariah, the government will also have to take care of economic problems.
From General Musharraf's initial few steps, it looked as if the nation would be freed of useless politicians, but the love for power changed all his plans.
Whatever expectations were, after joining the 'war of terror', he began to consider himself irremovable.
And whatever steps were expected were no more.
Just as Bush's rule began to close, he started to worry about the end of his own rule, and he struck a deal with thieves in the dark.
Even then, General Musharraf could have commanded the army, but the present government does not even know what is happening.
Whether in Bajod or Swat, the army cannot control terror, and instead they bomb the 'enemy', i.e. the public. Apart from loss of life and money, if they are making the 'enemy' psychologically ill, then we are the enemies, aren't we?
The conditions in the  terrorism struck area Swat in the Frontier Province are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area
On the one side the governments writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side the effect of Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everday in Swat.
On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.
The result is that on the one side the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other hand the Taliban has established their hold.
In between who got grinded, the poor citizens.
It is said that in Swat somebody asked, which type of people are the Taliban's are? The answer was  "very good people because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country".
Then asked how is Army, the answer was that the Army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.
Then it was asked, who are the enemies of religion and country, the answer was "the citizens"
I am astonished, how the Pakistan Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban's.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
But still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
After the girls schools, now boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfews are called so that the Taliban can move around easily.
During curfew tonight, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
The question arises as to how they got there despite the curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone explain to the army to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the Army can defeat any enemy.
He says, maximum bloodshed has been done on the base of religion, you tell me in the absence of any religion wont bloodshed occur?
Punjabi, Pathan. white and black, Mehsud and other tribes, are all these created by religion?
Not at all, sir, religion preaches us that there is no white, black, Punjabi or Muhajir, if there is no religion then half of the world would have been destroyed by the war of black and white and remaining half by the war of cast.
Actually religion nourishes human morally and restricts him that he is not here at his own rather is sent by The Creator of Universe and he has to live by God's rules.
As a Muslim I believe that Islam is true religion and a complete code of life.
After living in London, for many years I used to ask wellness of my family over the telephone every morning. Although many did not even call once to find out how we were. Then I realized that they do not even tolerate our phone calls so we stopped calling.
Living here in France for the last two years, I have also felt the same thing.
Do not know why people expect us to call.
A resolution passed about Iraq in a few hours, Darfar has absolutely no problem in sending peace army.
Bombay attacks were condemned in no time and banning dubious groups is only a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are doing consensus.
O caretakers of international peace! life is finishing here!
Is it for real that every one is waiting for its end?
So that no other victim will even think about using a great damage causing weapon like a sling shot to fight for his rights?
Doesn't your hear ache even when a father is running holding his son's dead body?
If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
But you are a shame to the name of humanity.
At least this was proven that this area was also Israel's country for thousands of years.
What should happen is that both the nations should live together happily and with love but since they are controlled by the west and arab countries, therefore peace can not be formed here with out their consent.
But even Iran wants to fight its proxy war here now.
Even if operations in Israel are stopped for the time being, they will start again after some other incident.
The interests of BBC homeland are affiliated to America and Israel and this is why under the wrapper of 'broadmindedness' it has produced a series of blogs consisted of 'Jewish favor' and is conducting one sided and blind 'propaganda'.
BBC is only carrying the 'formality' and its objective is to have sympathies!
It is requested to Mr. Moderator that he must publish this review so that it may be proved BBC has element of realism to some extent.
Thanks.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How could I not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time, including Derah Gahzi Khan, summer showers are taking place throughout the country.
Presented is a poem according to the season. Enjoy the rain along with this poem.
These rains are also from you
which when fell brings spring.
When it stops there is no movement
sometimes it came just like that, without a reason.
Sometimes it spread day and night.
sometimes loudly, sometimes silently.
These rains are also from you
in some remembrance some night
on some suppressed ashes
Sometimes it was such, that the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burnt itself.
Sometimes each drop seems sorrowful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What is it to them, whether the country lasts or not.
Whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them.
For one, our media is also corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government, and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday noon strange thing happened.
All together police running here and there but not ask on illegal parking
and moreover that NYPD traffic was also not in a mood to look at illegal parked cars.
it happened like this that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in Hudson river.
Till now it is just known this that "Terrorists" relation was with birds race Goose.
Yesterday was maybe New York's historic cold
Temperature do not drop to this degree
Me my own jaw is beginning to hurt after half hour of stroll outside.
Imagine that what would have happened to those people who jumped from plane in the river.
Happy news is that people all together stayed safe
and sad news is that ship of company sank in this financial crisis.
While watching all this I went to New Jersey by West Side Highway. I Noticed that South Bound is blocked, still what I did?
Yes, I was jammed in it on my way back.
Thanks God,during my an hour trip the road was bit cleared as I get an exit from 56 street.
Otherwise I did not avail the first two exit due to the long lanes of vehicles.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.

Sarah: I have slaughtered two chickens and how they are slaughtered, Jahanzeb has already mentioned.
Apart from this, there is no other way.

Snow till disappear
For no reason, we thought that the Taliban group from Sawat was non religious, who were only against women education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
But like majority of the ideas, this was not proven right also. According to this news of CNN, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a Boys school with gunpowder.
Swat, The Taliban has destroyed a boys school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Amen, then Amen.
Masha Allah, up till now, 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom of fixing marriages before birth among Muslims, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See a picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
just a while before this, the wedding of a dog with a girl took place.
look at that groom.
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
Today is the age of computer and computer's interference is growing in every aspect of life.
Lots of people have many reservations about this growing interference of computer like in financial issues.
As you have facilities for using credit cards but by this law enforcement agencies has also firmer grip on your private life.
That just by tracking the record of your credit card you can be exposed.
And in future when use of currency will be minimal its utility will increase.
Similarly in crimes world there is no need to rob the bank, information of credit card are hacked.
Similarly friendship has become computerized
, social networking websites like Orcet, Facebook and MySpace are ranked first in popularity.
But don't you feel that the more closer we are getting of these sites mentally, practically moving further away from people.
Similarly there is the website of match making, where by knowing your choice you are provided with a list of people according to your likings.
Can you spend life with your own cologne (of course not physical)?
I can't do it, that is why a life partner is known as better half.
That he/she may cover my deficiencies.
Perhaps I have got a small share of sense.
I used to believe everything someone elder says.
In the same way, I thought that my father knew the answer to every question on earth.
I used to get laughed at a lot for this.
But only that saying seemed true which could be possible.
Become much irritation because what was the reason to tell lie?
Bore loss on that saying even at this age
So it is my effort to say lie the very least.
Do not misguide someone by lieing and that also by attaching Allah's name.
and Allah willing say only when there is pray to Allah that work completes.
Remaining Allah knows better the state of intention.
This is a disgusting problem which is created due to reason of distance from religion.
According to law of both our Pakistan and religion, minor child should stay with mother.
Their expense is due to their father and father can meet with children.
Then when the kids get mature, they can live with anyone they want.
You have rightly said about the misunderstandings relatives create.
Our behavior is over taken by feudal thinking
Ever here this way of thinking is working that new co-sharers will be born in father's property and this is where the opposition is shown. Otherwise their father's this behavior is worth praise and pursuance.
With reference to relationships, these forceful affiliation has created evil in our society.
Concept of marriage of a divorced or a widow is ending.
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason family breakups.
In our society, if wife of a 50-55 year old man or husband of a woman goes to the next world and he marries again, why is he not respected?
There is a Pakistani uncle living close to us, his wife passed away around 10-12 years ago. Now after all his children got married, he married a widow, for which his kids have turned against him.
In my point of view, it is their religious right, what do you say?
What type of mentality is the 'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place', kind of mentality?
I believe that this persons children should have thought what is wrong if he married a widow, after he married off all his children?
Thereby, this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
As the children would definitely have gotten busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow if their wives refuse to look after them, when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is a curse in our society in which we are sunk since last 40 to 50 years.
Even a wife is agreed on the unethical activities of her husband but does not allow her for second marriage.
If she had the power She wont allow him of this even after her death.
Along with husband spoils her afterlife too and causes an increase in corruption in society.
Nothing happens with singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.
And about your question, when sir instead of bringing his wife home, goes to someone else's wife so the dependents just make a fuss for the show and stay quiet and satisfied. ( yeah, later the relatives of the wife get angry)
In IndopPak we embraced Islam centuries ago but can't get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then Islam.
Second marriage of man as ridiculous, divorce as stigma, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as disgrace and man's marriage with an elder woman as the result of her cunningness is all because of such thinking.
Moreover to copy the western nations we declare veil and worship backward.
It was easy to embrace Islam to get rid of such thinking is very difficult.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Amen
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.
Century passed writing such little writing
Know that little is much.
Allah Hafiz
Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes that i found this secret in my life that if leader of any Army is in front line then that Army will never lose.
But here situation is else.
To say that Common people are there to die for us if we die then martyr
if someone from common people dies then murder
May Allah bless and have mercy on you.
When I was coming back to the shop after Isha prayer tonight, one man who was sitting in  car, raised his hand and asked me to come.
I thought may be this man has forgotten his way or may be he wants to ask something. I stopped so his whole family was in his car.
He asked if I can understand Arabic very well or not. I said that there is no problem. You tell me what is the matter.
He started saying, I have come from Riyadh but here some one in Medina picked my pocket if you please help me. I said forget about it.Because  this has happened with me earlier also as I gave this man 20 riyals to pay for gas and go back to Riyadh but he started doing the same thing after moving forward a little.
I got really angry and when I told him and threaten him of a cop, he vanished from there.
So now this is the condition of us Muslims that even when we come to beg money, we come with families riding in cars and daily manage to get at least 2 to 3000.
Although there is an evident saying of the Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the hand above is better than the hand below and the hand above is the giving hand the lower is the taking hand.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims ( Amen)

The wife of famous singer Adnan Sami approached a Police Station in Mumbai, accusing him of torture.
The Police Station advised her to approach the court.
Saba Galadari the wife of Adnan Sami gave an application against her husband that Adnan Sami continuously tortures her
and he is also administering in human behavior against her.
Now this thing has gone out of her tolerance, therefore, a case may be registered against Adnan Sami.
Police  station has advised her to approach the court instead of registering  the case, on the plea that the case is not within the valid jurisdiction of police station
Do you think that the accusation on Adnan Sami by his wife is correct?
Can this accusation is an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Inform us about your opinion on the Subject.
Adam, Sanghad, Mehr
As far as accusations go, any person can accuse the other.
To get enraged for honor is not sensible.
Whatever be the case between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he had left his honorable life and went to India to earn money. Now that fame has fallen around his neck.
This is the result of his own actions.
Washington...
High ambassadors of America say that President Obama will take a strong stand against Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
In America's new policy for Afghanistan, instead of development, war has been given more importance.
The envoys say that Hamid Karzai is being considered a barrier in the achievement of American goals in Afghanistan, as there is corruption in the government and the business of middlemen has increased and the Taliban are once more gathering strength.
The American envoys say that among the people in the American government who are stressing upon Hamid Karzai to do something more are Vice President Joseph Biden and President Obama's representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Hallbrooke.
He said that this good administration was noticed after the President Bush left, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai after every 2 weeks and used to emphasize on the role of America in Afghanistan and the development of its city departments.
Officials say that Obama management will work with the state leaders as a backup with the main government.
Officials say that they will emphasize Hamid Karzai on fighting against corruption
Hamid Karzai faces new elections this year. And it is not clear as yet that Obama and his companions will favor his presidency or not.
Is this statement, of the American officials, a forecast of change in American policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is this era of Hamid Karzai ending?
What are your thoughts in this matter?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and SriLanka, Srilanka defeated Pakistan with 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Srilanka in the first one-day match although Srilanka won in the next two matches.
In this third one-day match, the nation's team performance was very poor. They worn out in only 75 runs in 23 overs against 309 runs made by the national team of Srilanka.And this is how we faced a lesson learning defeat.
From the results of the series, it becomes evident that the performance of the national cricket team is not consistent.
Despite home ground and all claims, the national team suffered defeat. What do you think are the reasons?
Which aspects of the game should experts focus on?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
Which part do you place the responsibility of the loss on, fielding, batting or bowling?
Let us know of your opinion.
Malik Babar Husain, Jeddah. It is very sad that even in todays modern age, such ignorant traditions are prevalent. If the landlord or the property owner targets innocent people with his harsh dictatorship, who will call them Muslims?
Let any big shot walk on these burning coals. Why does the government allow them to do that?
When will court justice come into play?
Sir Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan for playing one day international series.
Visit of a foreign team to Pakistan, in spite of Pak India tension is a good sign.
On reaching Karachi Airport the Sir Lankan team was given a warm welcome.
Two matches will be held between Pakistan and Sir Lanka in Karachi while the third one will be played in Lahore.
Both teams are asserting highly regarding their batting, bowling and fielding.
If Siri Lanka venerates its spinners, Pakistan’s reliance is on its fast bowlers.
Sir Lanka’s captain Mahela Jayawardene says that no one player but the whole Pakistan cricket team is dangerous.
Muralidharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, while Pakistan’s captain says that this competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik has said “we have played Murali Dharan before and will take care of Mendis as well. We have made a secret game plan and will reveal it on the ground”.
Will the Pakistan and Sir Lanka series live up to claims of being interesting and thrilling?
Which side will dominate in the Pakistan and Siri Lanka series?
who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Let us know of your opinion.
Gulfam, London, Publish statements that are of liking, you give preference to those too, it is our wish that even you write some truth, do not entangle the statement like Mukher Jee because it is commanded to say truth in front of tyrant and it is equal to Crusade(Jihad). What to say of Mukher Jee, change the statement between news and try to weep.

It is all these people's doing Kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years.
No, no one  asked, now they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism so they have started talking about peace and settlement.
First they generally massacred Muslims now they are perplexedly settling the matters.
In any way Pakistan has to understand their duplicitous policies.
Asad Khan London
India is creating such a situation that the world's attention can be diverted from Kashmir.
but Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now the British Government is also understanding that the Indians are taking cover from their occupation over Kashmir by blaming Pakistan of terrorism.
and they hesitate to talk to Pakistan over this issue.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that by resolving the issue of Kashmir will bring an end to extremism, the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
it should be clear that the newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister while talking to media in Mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Is India using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialog?
Let us know of your opinion.
Usman Aftab.
I think Super powers don't want to destroy Pakistan
rather they are thinking of certain policies to control her they are familiar that Pakistan is an atomic power
want to bring some sort of revolution
Foreign countries believe that by cornering Pakistan few hurdles may generate want to support Pakistan and also wish to achieve their goal
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn Pakistan.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.
Faheem Siddiqi
Ras al Khaima, This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is in how deep waters.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?

American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference advised newly elected President Barack Obama saying that he had made many mistakes in his presidency, and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
'I did, as a president, whatever I felt was appropriate, according to the situation, and the American law and constitution, giving preference to American interest over my own acceptance'.
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him, and considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this is my last press conference, and I thank the journalists and other friends who are present in the press conference.
Do you think Obama will not repeat the mistakes that Bush made?
Did Bush delay accepting his mistake?
Will Obama be able to follow Bush's advice?

This is very hurtful incident that Israel is publicly massacring the Palestinians, same situation is here in Kashmir but Security Council do not even bother by it.
As many organizations who are in Palestine and Kashmir should continue their fight till freedom and by creating unity between themselves keep fighting every kind of aggression, one of these days their Martyr will bring result. By the will of Allah
Israeli air attacks still continues in Gaza, since now several Palestinian Men, Women and children have been martyred.
Important political leader of Hamas Nazarian have been martyred with wife and kids.
There meeting of Security Council ended without any decision.
The condemning resolution presented by Libia and other Arab countries against Israel is facing American opposition in the meeting.
Israeli airplanes bombardment is continued since many days on Palestinian civil population.
The whole world reacted on Mumbai attacks but no country including America and England can see bloodshed caused by Israeli attacks.
Why the major countries of Muslim world are silent?

I think that actually, most of our people are illiterate. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties, the electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The crisis of electricity and gas has worsen in whole of the Pakistan
, on the other hand gas prices have been raised by average 8, while in few cities unavailability of petrol created immense worry for people.
Intense reactions, riots and torturous demonstration are continued in the industrial and business circles of Pakistan against the crisis of electricity and gas.
Industrialists have threatened a shutdown ultimatum.
In Karachi people are worried due to 8 to 10 hours load shedding.
Industrial sector is almost paralyzed.
Government Institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other.
Increasing the prices of electricity and gas is not a joke with people?
Why the solutions of the problems are not considered?
Is government not seeing the full stop on national development?
What steps you will instantly recommend for managing this crisis?
Let us know your opinion.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that they are giving difficulty to the public who called for a democratic government.
The unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a torture.
There is no control over government institutions.
The law and order situation is getting worse, day to day. May Allah have mercy on this country.

After ruling over America for eight years, President Bush left the White House, for presidential camp office, Camp David, so that the White House can be decorated and prepared for new President Barack Obama, according to his wishes.
In Bush's eight year presidency, the historic World Trade Center attack, the attack on the Pentagon, the action against Afghanistan and Iraq in the name of a global war against terrorism, in which armies of many countries were pulled into the war, and American resources were completely exhausted, were some of the memorable events of the Bush era.

The Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from touring Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, in an interview with Jeev News said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour, but due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step? Should sports not be separated from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision not harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that the security condition in India is bad, the England cricket team is continuing its tour, so why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?

Those people who are proud about going to India
and they make their films and videos over there, their eyes should open now, as to how much the people of India respect you.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami needs that he should come to Pakistan at first opportunity because respect did not suited him even there.

Indians attitude have changed after Mumbai attack.
Jagjit showed his reaction in this form that he hates Pakistan and Pakistani.
it should be known that Adnan Sami sung seven songs of Asha Bhosla, now how can he be out of tune, Adnan Sami should stay in India, no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam
Karachi, i will only say this on the statement of Jagjit Singh that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements suitable to situation Pakistanis open your eyes that how much you are given worth in India, understand the thinking of Hindu.
After the Mumbai incident, their hateful statements have increased now they are spitting poison against popular singer Adnan Sami.
According to foreign news agency the situation has become funny when President Bush along with Prime Minister Noor Almalki in press conference at his office in Baghdad when an Iraqi journalist said to President Bush, ""Dog, this is farewell kiss"".
After this journalist removed his shoe and threw it at Bush, President bush expertly moved his head out of the way and saved himself.
Second shoe hit the American flag.
Security officials dragged him out of there.
On this occasion President Bush said I don't know why he did this, shoe was of size 10, I was not bothered.
Do you think that this action by the journalist depicts the anger of Iraqi people against President Bush.
What will you say about this?

It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she changed totally.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party, and made her son the representative of Peoples Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi, This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
But until the iron ax is not fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are just like this, that they are adopting secretive ways. This is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.

Apart from this, a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organisations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organisations, they will be restricted from traveling and will be under arrest.
They will have to face cases.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India blaming these parties for the Bombay attacks without any proof?
Aren't there any terrorist groups in India?
Are International groups not aware of the tortures being done on the minorities in India?

Karachi, our leaders should understand this that people, they are doing the operation against, are the true valuers of Pakistan, who are tolerating all kinds of tortures but they love Pakistan.
If there would be war then they will fight for Pakistan.
When their love would be felt, just condenming politics will not work. I think between both, there might be going a resulting war.
