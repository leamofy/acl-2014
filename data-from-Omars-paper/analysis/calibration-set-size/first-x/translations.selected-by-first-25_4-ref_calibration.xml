   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.</seg>
    <seg id="3">In this book, called 'Nuclear Express', the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News, that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reid said that due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Among the factors are the design of the bomb, and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He further added that that was the reason that Pakistan was able to reply to India's Nuclear test with a nuclear test in just 2 weeks and 3 days.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961, Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test, in response to which America took 17 days to preform a test, despite having this bomb for a long time.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that the test of the Atom Bomb which Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998, was made with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reeds was questioned that China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan then he said in reply that because India was a common enemy for Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that there is a proof to this too that Doctor Abdul Qadeer Khan used Chinese design and after this the documents which were acquired from Libia also confirms this statement.</seg>
    <seg id="12">On a one more question that doing combined nuclear tests is common then he said that in 1990 America conducted a nuclear test for Britain on open belt in Nevada desert.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that we guess that too that Israel was given access to the results of this test.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reed was also questioned that Is the Chinese Nuclear spread program is continuing?</seg>
    <seg id="15">On this Thomas Reed said that china has been supplying raw material, instructions and design to nuclear facility in Iran's city Isfahan since 1990.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Other than that china also provided Iran a nuclear enrichment plant.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libia and Yemen thorough North Korea.</seg>

    <seg id="2">According to a new research, three cups of tea a day,</seg>
    <seg id="3">if taken, can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age, by more than a third.</seg>
    <seg id="4">In a research carried out by the Moffitt Cancer Institute, in the American state of Florida, it was revealed that the risk of occurrence of breast cancer tumors, in such women below the age of 50 years</seg>
    <seg id="5">who drink at least three cups of tea a day, is reduced by up to 37%.</seg>
    <seg id="6">It was also revealed in the research that there was no significant benefit, in these regards, in the woman aged above 50, who drank three or more cups of tea a day.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Experts believe that the reason for this is that tea has such ingredients in it, which are more effective against specific tumors which generally occur in women below the age of 50.</seg>
    <seg id="8">In Moffitt Cancer Center, in the city of Tampa, Florida state, a research was conducted on over 5000 women, who had undergone treatment for breast cancer.</seg>

    <seg id="12">A tenth of every breast cancer patient suffers this type of cancer.</seg>

     <seg id="2">New Research</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="3">Exercise is good for health in every age</seg>
    <seg id="4">This keeps the heart healthy,reduces the level of cholesterol,Helps in keeping the weight low, helps in reduction of sugar and reduces Alzheimer meaning decreases the speed of dementia.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Unfortunately, in many people with the increase in the age, the capability to carryout exercise also decreases.</seg>
    <seg id="6">The specialists say that with exercise our body and brain remain active but age can have effect on it.</seg>
    <seg id="7">The American Medical Association says that Many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="12">In which the pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.</seg>
    <seg id="13">The experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They learnt that as people grew old, there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says that as age increases, the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear, and this affects the ability to exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Garwin  Cain was also a part of this study.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this. And this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="18">Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.</seg>
    <seg id="19">If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart, they can achieve the benefits of excercise, despite the increase in age.</seg>
    <seg id="20">A detailed report of this has been published in the magazine of the American Medical Association.</seg>

     <seg id="1">Only Muslim League (N) was left, she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to Peoples Party.</seg>
     <seg id="2">Before this MQM and Muslim League (Q) has already submitted the draft of 18th amendment in assembly and senate.</seg>
     <seg id="3">Till now it appears that 18th amendment was a political move and none of the party is sincere in its approval.</seg>
     <seg id="4">This is why nobody has raised voice in the favor of this amendment in senate or assembly and neither forced the House to approve the amendment.</seg>
     <seg id="5">It seems that by submitted the draft of 18th amendment these parties has beaten around the bushes means they can claim that we had submitted the amendment but the ruling party's speaker did not proceed.</seg>
     <seg id="6">MQM is i coalation with government, Muslim League(N) is secret partnership with government and Muslim League(Q) is the party that passed 17Th ammendment, then how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17Th Amendment</seg>
     <seg id="7">This is the way to get ones name entered in the list of martyrs by just getting painted.</seg>
     <seg id="8">The Peoples Party is otherwise not in hurry to end the seventeenth ammendment.</seg>
     <seg id="9">How any one can think of getting his own hands cut.</seg>
     <seg id="10">Seventeenth Ammendment cannot be abolished till Zardari is the President.</seg>
     <seg id="11">This was the opinion of majority in one of our survey and it is also correct.</seg>
     <seg id="12">Zardari would not have opted to be the President, if seventeenth ammendment was to be abolished.</seg>
     <seg id="13">Now he is more powerful than President Musharraf, since along with President he is also  the chairman of Peoples Party.</seg>
     <seg id="14">The seventeenth ammendment is there till he is the president.</seg>
     <seg id="15">Political Parties will have to remove President Zardari first, in order to abolish  the seventeenth ammendment.</seg>
     <seg id="16">Neither MQM wants it nor the other parties.</seg>

     <seg id="1">In our family, most of the people are of the laborer type.</seg>
     <seg id="2">And in our childhood, when we used to see our uncles toil, we used to wish in our hearts that Allah save us from labor that is hard on the body.</seg>
     <seg id="3">To save ourselves from this, we wrote a letter to the editor of the Amroz daily, asking him what we can do after metric to save ourselves from having to toil.</seg>
     <seg id="4">The editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and take such and such subjects.</seg>
     <seg id="5">My focus was always on engineering, and after metric, instead of Biology, I took Technical Drawing.</seg>
     <seg id="6">But while entering the FSC, my elder brother forced me to do FSC in medicine and become a doctor.</seg>
     <seg id="7">I studied Biology for a month with great difficulty, and when I still could not understand anything, I took maths as a subject instead.</seg>
     <seg id="8">So the scare of having to work made me an engineer, and today I am in a very good condition compared to many of my same aged relatives, for which I am always thanking Allah.</seg>
     <seg id="9">I remembered this when I was trying to lift the carpet of my old house along with my two young sons.</seg>
     <seg id="10">It was not half an hour since we started working, that the younger son said "Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job"</seg>
     <seg id="11">We said, if that is true, then study a lot like us, and free yourself from bodily pain.</seg>
     <seg id="12">The son said that I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work.</seg>
     <seg id="13">Anyway, the three of us finished that work in three hours and returned.</seg>
     <seg id="14">My purpose of saying this is that if a person has set a goal, whatever be the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving his goal.</seg>
     <seg id="15">But if you do not even know what you have to do, then Allah alone is your protector.</seg>

     <seg id="1">It is said that don't accuse the dead, but can't help it as we see only evils in her on the first anniversary of Benazir.</seg>
     <seg id="2">On one side Benazir crushed independence movement of Sikhs by handing over the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India for her own sake and on the other hand provided India an opportunity to fully concentrate in Kashmir after crushing the movement in Punjab.</seg>
     <seg id="3">The greed of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years.</seg>
     <seg id="4">During her exile Benazir continued to give negative statements on Kashmir and Atomic Program.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Benazir made a deal with Pervez Musharraf while betraying the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif.</seg>
     <seg id="6">During her reign Benazir provided her husband the opportunity of making money and because of this he popularized as Mr. 10 percent.</seg>
     <seg id="7">Benazir brother was killed during her reign whose assassins are still safe.</seg>
     <seg id="8">Though a woman still Benazir avoided to fight for the rights of women.</seg>
     <seg id="9">Just like Benazir politicized her father's dead body similarly his widower husband politicizing her dead body.</seg>
     <seg id="10">Benazir reigned twice but not only she failed to punish her father's political murder but could not file a case against them.</seg>

     <seg id="4">and here is your country Pakistan whose president was dropped of the corruption charges before sworn in.</seg>

     <seg id="1">In this picture, President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded on all four sides by Americans.</seg>
     <seg id="2">It seems from his smile that</seg>
     <seg id="3">he thinks that America is with his government. He is forgetting that one year ago, they were with Pervez Musharraf.</seg>
     <seg id="4">This picture was passed on, as if it was of some family.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Previously, such a photo was never printed in newspapers before, i.e. one president with three American agents.</seg>
     <seg id="6">It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.</seg>
     <seg id="7">It is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.</seg>
     <seg id="8">If it was a smart ruler, at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo, and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting.</seg>
     <seg id="9">If the rules of democracy are implemented on this photo, President Zardari is in minority.</seg>

     <seg id="4">The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.</seg>
     <seg id="5">The result is that on the one side the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other hand the Taliban has established their hold.</seg>
