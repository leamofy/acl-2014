   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.</seg>
    <seg id="3">In this book, called 'Nuclear Express', the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News, that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reid said that due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Among the factors are the design of the bomb, and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He further added that that was the reason that Pakistan was able to reply to India's Nuclear test with a nuclear test in just 2 weeks and 3 days.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961, Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test, in response to which America took 17 days to preform a test, despite having this bomb for a long time.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that in May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with a lot of care and Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reed was asked this question that China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan so he said in his answer that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that its evidence is also present that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan has used the Chinese model. Later the documents received from Libya also confirm this.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Another question that is it common to do nuclear experiments mutually. Then he said that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that we also predict that Israel also has access to the results of this experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reeds was also asked if China is continuing nuclear proliferation?</seg>
    <seg id="15">On this Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and the design to a nuclear facility of Iran in its city Asfahan.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He said that China had been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Rome, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen via North Korea.</seg>

And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.</seg>

   </hl>
    <seg id="3">Exercise is good for health in every age</seg>
    <seg id="4">This keeps the heart healthy,reduces the level of cholesterol,Helps in keeping the weight low, helps in reduction of sugar and reduces Alzheimer meaning decreases the speed of dementia.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Unfortunately, in many people with the increase in the age, the capability to carryout exercise also decreases.</seg>
    <seg id="6">The specialists say that with exercise our body and brain remain active but age can have effect on it.</seg>
    <seg id="7">The American Medical Association says that Many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Pattricia P. Leka of Maya clinic Minnesota says that increase in age is a big reason for being handicapped from exercise and less physical activity.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She headed a research regarding heart diseases and man's ability to do exercise in older age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart.</seg>
    <seg id="12">In which heart's activity of pumping blood and its contraction and relaxation was studied.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They came to know that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says with increase in age, problems occur in the activity of relaxation of heart and with increase in age, this effects the ability to exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that we were surprised to see that it has an effect  and it confirmed that bad exercising ability is very much related to the heart relaxing activity.</seg>
    <seg id="18">In some instances, blood pressure is a factor in heart anomalies and heart diseases.</seg>
    <seg id="19">If doctors and patients can work together when it comes to heart diseases, then they can enjoy the benefits of exercise even with older age.</seg>
    <seg id="20">There has been a detailed report about this in the American Medical Association Publication.</seg>

     <seg id="2">And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="3">To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.</seg>
     <seg id="5">From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.</seg>
     <seg id="6">But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.</seg>
     <seg id="7">We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.</seg>
     <seg id="8">It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God</seg>
     <seg id="9">This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.</seg>
     <seg id="10">It was only half an hour since he started working that the little boy said " Daddy, I am not born to do this"</seg>
     <seg id="11">I said that if this is true then study a lot like us and get rid of the physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="12">The son said, "I am studying and I will get through it also but it is the work that I can not do"</seg>
     <seg id="13">Whatsoever we did that work in three hours  and came back home.</seg>
