'first nuclear experiment was done in 1990'
Thomas Reid who has worked in the Lever national laboratory of America as a Weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the Ex director of technical intelligence at Las Elmos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.
this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.
in an interview with US news, Thomas Reid said that in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's rule, China experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Thomas Reid said that based to many reasons, he has a belief that China had experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
the reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.
he further added that this was the reason that in 1998 only in a span of two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments as a reply to Indian nuclear experiments.
Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiment.
He further said that in May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with a lot of care and Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.
When Thomas Reed was asked this question that China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan so he said in his answer that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.
He said that its evidence is also present that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan has used the Chinese model. Later the documents received from Libya also confirm this.
Another question that is it common to do nuclear experiments mutually. Then he said that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.
He said that we also predict that Israel also has access to the results of this experiment.
Thomas Reeds was also asked if China is continuing nuclear proliferation?
On this Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and the design to a nuclear facility of Iran in its city Asfahan.
Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.
He said that China had been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Rome, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen via North Korea.

The role of European Union for the peace in Middle East
Officially European Union plays a decisive role in the mediatory efforts taken for stopping the war in Middle East.
According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of Sarkozy are helping hands in this process.
European Union spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said every single step which may help in delivering the conjoint message of European Union to fighting parties is appreciable.
Officially everything seems fine.
But in fact European Union is portraying a picture of internal tension, stress and strain.
The role of Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak
plus internal affairs has made her helpless.
On the other hand the course of action of French President Sarkozy depicts that France is still the President of European Union.
Although 6 months Presidency tenure of France is over.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role which he is capable of, but he isn't the authority.
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner is facing the funniest side.
He is in the delegation which is led by Schwarzenberg the Foreign Minister of Czech Republic.
In addition to that, the two foreign ministers are giving different statements on the war in Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend herself, while according to Kouchner war is not the defense. Germany has also sent a special ambassador to Middle East. As long as European Union does not show unanimous stand, she can not be successful on diplomatic front.
The prove is the no lift conduct of Israel to mediatory efforts of European Union.
This is the best time for European Union to prove herself, as America has failed in Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.

Adolf Marclay, resident of Swabia in south Germany has left behind a huge industrialist group.
But he was not known to German public a while back.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks for weeks regarding his debts towards industrial groups, he became the hot news and could see the dark future for Marckay group.
Marclay Group had to bear the loss of hundreds of million euros after it bought the shares of one of known industry Folks Wigan.
then the financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed 100 Million and 1 billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on Marclay.
Recently the same banks accepted to provide loan to Marclay group on urgent basis but Adolf Marclay who started as a small industrialist to reach a place where his industrial group's annual income reached 30 billion euros, couldn't bear the the loss in his financial strength.
After the death of his father when Adolf Marclay took the responsibility of the business he used modern methods and made the business more successful.
He named his company Ratiopharm which is now Germany's most successful and biggest pharmaceutical company.
Till recent times this phamasutical company had a budget of around 5 to 6 billion euros and even now it is earning around 8 billion euros annually. After the great success of Rasue farm the Marclay Group bought many big industries like Hi-Del Barag Cement a manufacture of construction equipment. Kassbohrer and other good car maker
Marclay Group has a employee number of around 100 thousand around the world and among its industries, Rasue Farm has always been given special importance.
Adolf Marclay has said this many times in his life. ""We have been in pharma business since four generations"".
Now the industry is handled by the children and i hope that it continues to work for few hundred years by our family.
After the suicide of Adolf Marclay,the banks have given approval of temporary loan of 400 million euro for his group VEM but on this condition that VEM have to be sold to  Rasio Farm so that the financial position of this group is improved on long term basis.

Results indicate that here foreigners
crime rate is less then the crimes committed in the whole province.

Why reduction in exercise with increase in the age
New Research
Exercise is good for health in every age
This keeps the heart healthy,reduces the level of cholesterol,Helps in keeping the weight low, helps in reduction of sugar and reduces Alzheimer meaning decreases the speed of dementia.
Unfortunately, in many people with the increase in the age, the capability to carryout exercise also decreases.
The specialists say that with exercise our body and brain remain active but age can have effect on it.
The American Medical Association says that Many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out.
Dr. Pattricia P. Leka of Maya clinic Minnesota says that increase in age is a big reason for being handicapped from exercise and less physical activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo clinic.
She headed a research regarding heart diseases and man's ability to do exercise in older age.
Team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart.
In which heart's activity of pumping blood and its contraction and relaxation was studied.
Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.
They came to know that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.
Dr. Patricia says with increase in age, problems occur in the activity of relaxation of heart and with increase in age, this effects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research
He says that we were surprised to see that it has an effect  and it confirmed that bad exercising ability is very much related to the heart relaxing activity.
In some instances, blood pressure is a factor in heart anomalies and heart diseases.
If doctors and patients can work together when it comes to heart diseases, then they can enjoy the benefits of exercise even with older age.
There has been a detailed report about this in the American Medical Association Publication.

May God answer the world's prayers and may Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, but we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan , effected by this change, are in our favor.
That what will Mr. Barrack Obama give to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams.
Obama's (whose name has Hussein also), oath as a President of America on one hand is historical while on the other hand is a hard test too
not only for him but for all those people who has supported him heartily.
This will also be a test for white people majority as it is not easy for them to accept heartily the presidency of black on them.
Here in Southern Asia specially Muslims who have developed expectation from him must remember that he has been elected as President of America and Obama must remember that President of America is Practically the president of the whole world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have to have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, so this will be a win for people who love him.
What will be its effect on South Asia and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan.

Dear, whether it is Obama or some one else, the decision of the policy of the entire world is done by Jews lobby of  billionaires, influencing, powerful and effective people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts,the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is in front of everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat, who had a regular Army and Law.
He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a  pact
but it is matter of sorrow that our government treated Swat like a step mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government of the ruler of Swat.
and no interest was taken in the building and development works
The girls who are getting education today are much lesser in number than  those who used to get educated in the previous era.
Targeting of educational institutes is continued by local Talibans in NWFP Province of Pakistan.
Most schools are destroyed in Swat majority of those are of girls.
Not only this Taliban has announced a ban on girls education.
Thousands of students (boys and girls) are unable to get education.
What do you think Talibans wants to achieve by stopping women education.
Why the government has failed to stop these illegal actions?
In your opinion what government should do.
Question must be this that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
Because Swat people has understand the game that army is there to serve Taliban not to kill them otherwise how five schools can be destroyed in a single night during curfew, how people can be butchered and hanged in the square.
When government writ is unable to implement in Swat in these circumstances how the government will succeed in eliminating these illegal activities.
Now the question is when government has every thing like armed force, latest weapons, latest technology and spy system then why these Taliban can;t be controlled?
The only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught.
The essence is that these Taliban are paving the path for 'International Imperialism' by their bad deeds.
fifteen years before the war was continued in Afghanistan.
The ISI was controlling the Taliban while on the opposing side was the northern coalition that was being aided by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly the scenario changed and the activities of the Taliban came into light.
And the ISI also was offered financial aid by the Americans which resulted in past friends becoming foes.
Now the scenario is that the war is still raging but the supporters in Pakistan are still the same, Iran, India and Russia.
Until mankind can understand the difference between whats right and whats wrong he will always make the wrong decision.
For example if a thief goes to perform a crime but just before he commits it he realizes that its a wrong thing to do and that robbing is a sin and that it is punishable so if he fears his Lord he will then not commit the crime.
Now in the same way until and unless Israel understands that it is doing the wrong thing by shedding the blood of innocent people in Gaza and that it'll be punished for as long as it continues to kill innocent people there.
Greetings!
The question is that is war, aggression, the answer to the Terrorist issue?
If not then what is that unique formula that can move us toward solving this issue?
this is right that war, is a destructive way it never solves problems instead it increases it.
Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq should adopt these models in order to get Independence which Nelson Mandela uses in South Africa
to fight more for social , ethical and subjective rather than armed.
kashmiri's participation in election shows that they have accepted this point.
Israeli attacks are going on Gaza from 3 weeks and death toll has reached to 1000.
world diplomacy efforts has till now not resulted in a cease fire
an according to one survey , attacks after 27th December has resulted in 90,000 Palestine leaving there homes and moving towards a safer place
on the other hand, NGOs has accused Israel for not taking care of Palestine Kids and said that one whole Generation of Palestine Kids are in serious cycology and emotional trouble.

Give Taliban a Chance.
Basit, Peshawar
Wake up! If Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down girls schools?
And kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
These Taliban has damaged Islam so much that no other nation or religion has done.
Persian era.
Kohat Pakistan
If the whole Islamic world just threat Israel for launch of attack you will see that in how much pain father of Israel America will be in
and not only talks about real ceasefire rather ceasefire will be accomplished.
But what to do our Muslim leaders lack the courage greatly.
Some one ask Ahmadinejad to take the initiative because your bravery is very popular in BBC Forum.
The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights does not rest with the Arabs or the Muslims of the world alone but is the obligation of the entire world community to raise their voice against tyranny.
This dreadful incident is the worst amongst the crimes committed by Bush.
Just like in Pakistan and India at the end of the financial year on 30th of June, the governmental institutions are pillaged; the American establishment before the expiry of its term gave a green signal to Israel to do whatever she wants.
On the one hand, America says that a ceasefire will be attempted.
On the other side, the United Nation is passing one resolution over another but both have done nothing practically, this means that united nation is also working  to crush the Muslims.
All the Islamic Countries should cancel their membership of United Nations and they should lay the foundation of there own international organisation.
Many examples are in front of us, where only promises and resolutions of America and United Nations came forward but only the Muslims suffered.
What is the advantage of these actions when BBC does not have to print anything.
Now, where have the principles of general ism been buried,When the unrequired blood especially of the Muslims starts flowing, at that time the ghost of unbiased reporting starts riding over the BBC.
Otherwise portrays itself as flag bearer of righteousness.
Saying something from their side is a far away thing, they do not want even comments
from the Muslims.
The difference between you and Jews is that they call themselves Jews and Martyr the Muslims and people like you live among Muslims, by calling themselves Muslims, to Muslims
[syja786]
For a long time on BBC forums, sometimes suicide bombing and other times terrorism in India was used to target a certain sect.
The favorite word of these Anti-Islamic discussions was Extremism.
You can get a very good idea, about who an extremist is, from the above discussion in which, writing against Iran was almost considered blasphemy.
When will our muslims understand that Anti Christ can not be fought with swords.
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what shall one do other than crying?
But the basic fault is of this turmoil and massacre which by naming Jihad, we try to blacken the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of Palestinians accepted the existence of Israel then why did Hammas need to fire those rockets on Israel and made suicide attacks?
Attitude of the both the sides is against humanity.
The role of UN and the USA was again seen as favoring towards the injustice of Israel.
May Allah give muslim nation the understanding of becoming  united. Ameen!
As a matter of fact,think about giving Noble Prise to terrorists for carrying out this painful terrorist activity, as a campaign against terrorism, eventually the actual work is being done by them.
Otherwise, is it possible to carryout terrorist activity on such a massive scale without the assistance of Chiefs and  every one knows who are pulling their strings.
In such a situation it can be termed as high handedness "Do what ever you can".
The strong mans fist,it beats over the head and do not let one cry.
The Arab rulers are giving medicines for the injured,Funeral clothing's for the dead and money and they are asking
should the Israelis continue attacks?
The actual problem is that the rulers of Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia are dreaming undutiful while asleep,Neither they have army nor they have defence plans,they just think that by providing aid they have done their duty.
They should immediately take practical steps against the Israel
like cutting of oil supply to European countries and America, but sorry for them.
Regards to all brothers and sisters
In my opinion, telling Hamas to quit in the name of peace now, would be an injustice to thousands of widows and orphans.
If the Israelites and their supporters are at a rise, then soon Moses shall be born, as this is the law of nature. America and Israel work as gunpowder amongst suicide bombers in Muslims.
The power drunk elephants do not understand this.
Abu Abdulla: Pakistan.
Hamas and Israel should reconcile so that this bloodshed comes to an end.
Muhammad Sarfraz, Paris, France
Absolutely true.
Let’s suppose that Hamas is really the righteous one and they have waged Jihad against the tyranny to become successful in the divine court, even then they should at least realize that if good brings harm to the people then it is of no use
Those who claim to love God, his Messenger, and their religion; it becomes an integral part of their faith to love humanity.
So after muslims, all believers who are living on this earth should be wiped out according to the command of Allah?
Najeeb-ur-Rahman Psycho *Lahore* [Pakian]
No! It is not decreed to annihilate but it is decreed to invite people to Islam.
But people who do conspiracies against the religion, it is decreed to do Jihad against them.
One should fight with them until they finish their conspiracies. But this certainly does not mean that they can wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the consequence of a murderer of children is disaster.
But its a request to my friends that yesterday Israelis did not have a roof over their heads and today they are so strong that they do not listen to anyone because all Jews are one.
They do not have Shiite nor Sunni, all are just Jews. And they have succeeded in every field and made everything.
Opposite to this, what is the condition of 55 Islamic Countries?
Lagging in every field and now the condition is this that they are so helpless that enemies are killing them and they are waiting for their death.
Point required is that all Muslim countries should get together and should make a plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better course of action than accepting Israel. Learn new technology and ways of success from them and let the world live in peace.
Muslims have great land and resources.
The need is correct usage.
First of all, the most tragic part is that Hammas and Alfatah could not be united.
The only reason to destroy great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin was to weaken the only nation fighting for Aqsa Mosque. And it was impossible until Yasir and Yasin were removed from the way.
The world is watching that how Palestine was falling down every second after the death of these two leaders.
And  how this lobby of jews strengthened their target by every moment.
In 1974 a Pakistani Prime Minister was of such an International trust that first time in history he united all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance.
Today on his 81st birthday is it hard enough for the nation to promise for unity with each other
but by eliminating the differences between other Muslims will accomplish its (establishment of Islamic Common Wealth) incomplete mission.
its a monster that has gripped Palestine for half a century.
this monster has many faces.
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
and its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
this monster is most unhappy with Islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through Islam, Muslims, the perfect religion of Muslim and Practical Islam as the history tells that Islam has put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since 27th of December.
more that 3 hundred Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
after the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
however the Israeli authorities say that they will continue operation in Gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
in your opinion, is this claim of Israel true that it's doing all this for defending the sovereignty of Israel?
is the world community playing its role in such situation?
does this aggression has an indirect relation with the coming elections in Israel?
can any improvement be expected in the situation in Middle East after the succession of the newly elected American president Barak Obama.

"when the night of loneliness can be passed by tearing down
when an affliction can be avoided with only prayers" (Nawabzadah Nasrullah Khan)
Such reviews are anxiously telecasted by BBC.
After all the image and prestige of neutralism has to be kept.
Though BBC news are often true but the real thing is the delivery.
What to highlight and which news is given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
Now In this regard our Pakistani print and electronic media, specially few Urdu newspapers and columnists etc. are not behind in the trade who in the coverage or writing of increasing terrorism exaggerate to hell.
has said that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. how long this hypocrisy will continue.
Why is so much oppression being done on the Muslims? If people such as America stop supporting these Jews, then Allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support, and then see what kind of life they get.
All these world renowned leaders and people who murder innocents in the name of peace should realize that peace in the world can only be achieved by justice, and not through injustice or wiping entire races.
If killing a particular race off completely is the answer, then Hitler's plan would not have seen any jews survive, and definitely not seen their rise.
Says a poet
Injustice is injustice. If it breeds, it dies.
Blood is blood. If it bleeds, it dries.
How can anyone define terrorism?
Isn't all this terrorism too? Why does only ones pain seem painful?
Aren't other people human too? So why is only Muslim blood so important? Wasn't all the innocent people's blood red too?
So why are there no disapproval messages now?
I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.
Dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood, how shall we condemn, I can not find words!
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims that on one side people are being killed in India so the rest of the world comes over Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations otherwise we will do it ourselves!
And on the other side, Israel is killing generations of muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent. This is unbearable!
There is delay but not NEVER in the house of God and only then will this darkness shed. Then
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Considering elections, the rulers should do such activities for people's support. There is no doubt in this specially when countries like Israel exist. Rest talking about Barrack Obama, then history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy and nor will do it. Regime, whether black or white, is a regime.
It appears from the conversation of forum that everyone is grieved over Benazir death but as politician her mistakes are not forgotten.
It is debatable that Benazir died for democracy or for power.
If she sacrificed for democracy then why she left democracy in the dictatorship of Musharraf for 10 years till she got a deal and American clearance?
Benazir did not return Pakistan when dictatorship affected people needed her she returned Pakistan when she has the assurances of free from cases and of power.
No one is going to say anything about the way that this historical figure is being falsely accused.
Sana Khan.
Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them.
One more writer.
Sir/Madam, maybe if you read not only the history of Pakistan, but of it's neighboring four countries, or of seven other countries, then you might understand the meaning of Mr. Psycho.
Tariq Abbas
One whose nature is wrong cannot be taught.
For reflection in water is not always clear.
Britain never let them become one, and invented the hindu-muslim friction which was taken ahead by sir Syed.
Psycho
How merciless is our nation. We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.
We have succeeded a lot!
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar if you en wreathe him with books.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks but Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.
If they talk about war then both the sides will suffer human loss.
India says that Pakistani citizen is caught in Bombay attacks. And he has written and sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. But earlier, when India caught this extremist, said that he is a smart engineer but later they declared him to have studied only four grades. This is what has to be considered.
First of all, merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and  all christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
We want flowers of peace rather in the flame of war.
War is itself a problem.
What solution will the war give?
Today will give Fire and blood.
Tomorrow will give hunger and necessity.
For this wise people
it is better that war keeps postponing.
In your and our garden
it is better that candle keeps lit.
The relationship of India America have become deep and India knows that when the time comes America will openly deceive Pakistan.
This is also the history of America.
Though in case of an attack by India, America will achieve her goals and the expenditure will all be that of India.
Pakistan should clearly state that they will not take the initiative but if any aggression is waged, then the talk of peace and ceasefire will only take place either after India’s complete destruction or its capture, even if this happens at the cost of their lives.
This is exactly what Islamic history is.
Before this resolution Pakistani people and army has delivered their message.
Indian struggle for having unusual diplomatic and military benefits in compensation of Mumbai attacks are proving her cunning party then affected. Therefore the world has reduced its pressure on Pakistan contrasting to its initial hard reaction.
UN has expressed faith on Pakistani efforts ignoring the unnecessary lamentation of India and Interpol's appreciation of Pakistani efforts is the 'side effect' of unwanted Indian diplomacy.
there are no two opinions over this that it is a heinous act.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past one year?
Every day, how many Taliban die due to the firing of the thousands of mortar and canon shells they fire?
I appeal to the ICI that they stop their guardianship of the Taliban, for Gods sake, and let us live peacefully in paradise like Swat.
And they stop this fixed operation.
The day is not far when in UN resolution of Army intrusion in Pakistan will be approved just like the one against Jamat Aldawa.
Riaz Ahmed Farooqi
First our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in UN,
and suppose if this resolution took time to approve then considering the example of America any country will launch the attack at her own.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
As the bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are deathless even after being dead.
But here an international game is being played. Here ferrocity and animosity is created to do the ruling.
So there can be reason created that if we are not here then these vandals and animals can come take over the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
America sees the torture of these extremists but instead of being sad on these faithless activities, they easily name them as tribal culture.
The reason for these faithless activities, sometimes given in the name of tribal culture and other times in the name of Islam, is not something done by a person with a heart.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so brave that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also men of God and so is our army.
It is very clear that there is fishy.
instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and lesson gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell,
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Who burnt the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on the refusal of oath after the Prophet (PBUH) passed away and how took her husband by the rope in his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
Was the attack on Medina by the the Army of Yazid and and the incident of Karbala was the conspiracy of Jews and Pagans?
Without accepting the facts, neither motives can be removed nor these can be corrected?
BBC people, stop this dual policy.
The better super hit title than this is:  the beating  of Bush with shoes is right or wrong?
this should have been the topic.
Tahir Chowdary, Japan
Be ashamed, the body of a person was taken out of the grave and hanged on a pole because he spoke against the cruelty and you are struck up over the topic of Box Office.
For the success of Operation Sherdil and across the border the success of Operation Lion Heart depends on the favor of people.
It is carried out by American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahib is a victim of conspiracy.
In this forum all reviews will be against Taliban, Agencies have been successfully indulged in Taliban and are applying the policies which might change public opinion.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public. They even report something like this 'Bombing on Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000, in Swat went there to do.
That the bodies of the Taliban who helps the army is left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake stop this drama.
These Talibans have tarnished the Muslim image.
If in the whole world true Muslims don't call these terrorists as Muslims then how come these elements are able to live in the lands of true Muslims.
Those who become shameless, can't do hard labor they pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
There is no allowance of this in any religion or family traditions.
Including BBC all the media present their views in different styles on Taliban or the tribal people.
But no one is aware of the ground realities or what the truth is. It is us the tribal people who know what rally is the matter.
In short, its a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a talib or a tribal. Who made these institutions? Warmongers who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions.
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute the leader of MQM, Althaf Husain, and the leaderships of ANP and PPP, as they have spoken against this cancer, i.e. the Taliban.
This cancer was given birth to by Zia-ul-Haqq. He has gone, but he has destroyed Pakistan as he went.
But I have hope that the present government will eradicate this cancer.
After Mumbai attacks India said that few extremist groups are involved in these attacks.
Pakistan denied these blames and said that she will fully cooperate in the investigation.
India said that she has provided Pakistan a list of 20 extremists, who are wanted to India.
Noe Pakistan said that leader of Jaish e Muhammad Maulana Masud Azhar present in this list is not detained and Government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before this President Asif Ali Zardari has denied the impression that Western Secret Agencies and Indian Government have provided Pakistan the proves of Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said about Ajmal Qasab that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
During this Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that Indian relation with her can't get better till the time her soil is used for terrorism.
And in recent updates Indian Cricket team has canceled its tour of Pakistan.
Should these political incidents affect sports?
How do you see the future of Pakistan and India relations?
Pakistan will not be torn apart by America or India.
It will be torn apart by Pakistani themselves.
What can you expect after so much internal segregation and rivalry?
However, Jinnah didn't do well with the Muslims from India, and time has already proven that.
Yasmin: Chicago.
Madam, if Jinnah's work was carried forward, then these internal cancer of segregation and rivalry would not have spread, and the muslims in India wouldn't be in the situation they are in now.
But it is our fault that we couldnt reproduce a leader of similar stature.
If we can't respect our leaders then
There are many able people in this part of the world.
God knows when some sense will return to the people and when the blessing of consensus in opinion will help develop this area.
In both countries the Mullahs, Pundits, Taliban, Shiv Sena and the RSS etc have been established to oppose the peace process.
And destructive forces don't want this area to develop and for this these countries are manipulated like puppets.
Can you imagine with the aid of consensus between Pakistan, India and China what position they would have in the world.
It is Gods punishment who has positioned thieves, robbers and manipulators as leaders of this country.
May God safe guard Pakistan from any harm, Amen.
But sir open your eyes and look around and see the current situation and ground realities that reveal the extent to which the American have progressed.
Besides this the situation in the country doesnt seem to be stable, like in the NWFP, Baluchistan and Sindh, and the problems in Karachi are also evident.
In this atmosphere we need a leader that can unite the people of this country.
O God please show us some mercy.
I believe we have no other option but to go to war one last time.
Enough is enough.
It's now or never.
These fraudulent dialogues and pointless meetings are not the solution to the problems.
Neither is by committing small scale terrorist acts in each others territories.
After all it was only after waging the Second World War that Europe managed to sort its problems out.
And if it wasn't for this World War then they'd still be arguing and nagging each other over small things.
Almost all of our political parties agree on this matter that these terrorist and denominational activities should be terminated from the country.
But our army rule does not seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, American and Europe are made to believe that we are with you on this war against terrorism and the other hand, we also help Taliban secretly.
We have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way. Thank you.
There is no doubt in this that majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are the members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined  the party  named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.
Although these members preferred subsidiary activities and now after India's great persistence, The United Nation has invalidated it also and Government of Pakistan is continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it is better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
Terrorist groups present in Pakistan, who support professional criminals and the heads of those Mullahs are those who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.
And now they are doing everything to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called Human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan from these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous or not?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose work is only to kill.
Heart is breaking into pieces on this news.
What world is this where it is hard to survive for the one who names an important part of Allah's religion Islam.
Non Muslims can kill Muslim, but if Muslim even tries to take revenge then along with the whole non Muslim world our hypocrite leaders also treat the ones sincere with true and sincere religion like they are treating our great leader Hafiz Saeed now a days.
As a penalty of Mumbai attacks India.
Pakistan relations are affected, and the recent improvement of relations between two countries is enormously shocked.
India has been continually blaming active armed and unarmed groups in Pakistan
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the action against these groups.
Whereas Indian Security agencies has directly blamed Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks
, in this regard Jamat Adawa has also been nominated.
It is not the first time that because of any terrorist attack the relation of these two countries are worsen.
In December 2000 after the attacks on Indian Parliament both countries were at the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashkr e Taiba was banned and was included in terrorists list.
Now Jamat Adawa, to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of Lashkr e Taiba, is demanded to be banned.
What do you think, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against active extremist groups on her soil?
Can by banning Jamat Adawa present India,
Pakistan crisis will vanish and to what extent it is vital to ban armed groups for establishing forever peace between the two countries.
Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly?
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful state.
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salam- Please do it with pleasure but act at your own.
do not do it under American pressure.
if India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
And why it accuses us of every thing?
there are extremist groups and organizations in India as well, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the world?
What India is doing in Kashmir, what is that?
What Israel is doing, what is that?
the truth is; we are the first Nuclear Muslim State and why; this is the main issue.
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart and circumstances also seems to be such
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be the part of this conspiracy.
American are not slowly but now very swiftly tightening there grip over Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances,if we as a nation does not display unity and solidarity then if Bangladesh can be created,anything else can also happen.
More the terrorism is condemned lessor it is , whether it is in a Hotel at Mumbai or it is in Marriott Hotel Islamabad or it is in Palestine.
Like wise irrespective of the origin of the terrorist, these should be eliminated, no matter these are Pakistanis or Indian or American or Israelite.
Now the question is that why the whole world including the Pakistani officials are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack carried out on Marriott Hotel was not a terrorist attack?
Then why?
Appreciation for Interior Advisor Rehman Malik, Masha Allah he has become very brave!
According to BBC on one hand (a committee of) Security Council of UN has banned Jamat Aldawa, on the other hand Mr. Malik says we didn't impose the ban and if it is to be done will be after through research.
Not this, according to BBC Mr.Malik has strongly denied the impression that arrest of terrorists are taking place because of 'someone's instructions'
Highly appreciated!
Having this capability or not, this I don't want to say.
Whose war we Pakistanis are fighting
and why. We have our own priorities which we shall protect with our full strength.
Nobody has an authority to interfere in any other country.
Apparently colonial period does not seem to exist.
If people are sure to have justice or Allies support the importance of free judiciary and give respect to democratic institutes and dont support the dictatorial governments; peace can be achieved in third world countries including Pakistan. But this is not acceptable for allies
Pakistan is always following European and American purposes.
This goes on without the approval of many of its citizens.
And it invokes hostile sentiments.
If you believe in the United States of America, then why not just give up your place and leave honorably?
Pakistan has the ability to be armed or unarmed.
Security forces raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
Pressure is being increased on Pakistan for taking rapid action against extremist organizations after Mumbai attacks.
India blames Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Secretary Condolisa Rice asked Pakistani leadership to take practical measures for instant and transparent action against the responsible s of Mumbai attacks.
She says that no doubt the extremists responsible for Mumbai attacks used Pakistani soil.
During this Peshawar Government says that unknown armed persons has set another truck stand for supply of goods to Allied Forces deployed in Afghanistan on fire, due to which more then fifty vehicles are destroyed.
It is the second attack on Neto and American supplies during 48 hours in Peshawar.
During this Pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from Karachi to Tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action.
It is revealed that during the reign of General Zia ul Huq because of the invasion of the ex USSR in Afghanistan and its resistance started by the American and Saudi funding resulted in the birth of armed groups of which Pakistan unable to terminated could not get back herself to the era before 1980s.
The question is does Pakistan want to do it?
Is Pakistan capable of doing this?
What do you think?

I have got a single question from all of the human right champions.
It is impossible for them to stand infront of you with neclaces if you kill their childeren.
NO TRANSLATION FOUND ON 1184
And now I do have a question for you that if there is any logic,statement or philosphy from the Islamic studies to Eastern and Western studies that permit killing innocent people including Nimazi(prayer offerer Muslim),labourer and job oriented poor workers in revenge of the American attacks?
And if NO,then you need  hard to rectify your point of view.
Peoples were armed at that time it was feared that after Afghanistan, Russia will attack Pakistan so people were armed.
Now when there is the danger of American attack via Afghanistan of which current American President clearly expressed in his presidential campaign then why should we disarm these people?
Only for this that after defeating Pakistani Army America or India may not face any public resistance?
Yes, if any of them is involved in sabotage activities then only Pakistan should take action against him.
But the sad fact of the matter is that leaders of Lashkare Tayyaba declared the accusations of India correct that Pakistan was involved.
Najeeb Ur Rehman Psycho *Lahore*
Even if this is accepted that Lashkare Tayyaba is involved, still the blame cannot be placed on the Pakistani Government.
And another question arises that did these terrorists not have the aid of some government or non-government employee of India.
Are the Terrorist only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not prepared in India or other nations of the world.
As for as Lashkr e Taiba is concerned ongoing terrorism is not linked to it.
It must be recalled that Hafiz Saeed was the first 'Militant Leader' who declared activities of Taliban 'revolt'.
I am quite sure that Taliban agitation is a vital part of American plans so every person or organization must be eliminated who challenges Taliban in any aspect.
Despite the cooperation of the whole nation action against Lashkr due to the pressure of India indicates the nervousness and flatterness of Zardari and Co.
To terminate the expedition started by the American and Saudi funding, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society.
Also protest them that by what ethics American and Saudis are spreaded dangerous arms and so called Jihadi but in fact the virus of  loathsome literature and culture, due to which human butcher houses established in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly. And tried its best that India should attack Pakistan.
This shattered the confidence of America in the area.
Although India did not even threatened nor it has the guts to.
And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of Taliban or American posts.
Thus it was proven that without the support of Pakistan and its army, America can not do anything.
Karachi Business Financial Center of Pakistan is Dubai of underdeveloped areas.
Hundreds of thousand never return empty pocket from here, but since the grip of law has weekend in Western Frontier areas all eyes are on Karachi.
Now they are about to kidnap this city.
First time Pathans are named Pakhtoon, residents of a city are involved in fighting like strangers, although need of the time is unity.
One possible solution to the problem is this that either Urdu speaking learn Pashto or Pashto speaking learn Urdu, or whats better is they all learn English.
You will surely think this as a ridiculous suggestion but do you think that reason of this conflict is not ridiculous?
That reason of violence is language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir i gave this suggestion  in childhood in reality to my friends in which there were people according to classification from every religion and dialect but friends used to laugh on my talks.
At that time the condition of Jinn of hatred of dialectal and religious was not that alive and strong but it was brewing internally.
Can't understand what and why it is happening?
Are these the indicators of Dooms day.
By what reason innocents are dieing?
Every one knows the causes those who want to destroy Pakistan are involved and those who commit all this have no religion or country.
Either Karachi or Mumbai it is an inside job.
Every upcoming government gets herself involved in changing the names of places, like now a days airport, roads, buildings all Benazir.
Is this the meaning of Benazir which is happening in Karachi and to the peoples of Pakistan?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awaken sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
Where reaction full of patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties have taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time they have also given American planners one more chance to think.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the worse situation in Karachi and administration is not neutral.
Administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately
, police and rangers don't take action because of political parties pressure.
To unite is only expressed in speeches, political parties should have to quit their interests and work for common people.
Till the end administration is under political pressure such incidents will increase, Allah bless Pakistan.
In my opinion, they are the biggest terrorists.
And of course there are external powers active in this. But no one knows who they are?
But what is sad the most is if this kind of situation occurred in some city of Sarhad, government would have done what not but now when it is not in Sarhad, the government is so helpless.
Government should do an operation here and save country's big and an important city.
Otherwise, Pakistan will face a big economic setback.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth being scared. On the other hand Pakistan's media's condition is even worse.
The complete truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is this that Urdu speaking people should learn Pashto or Pashto speaking people should learn Urdu or it is even better if everyone learns English.
You will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but don't you think the reason for collision is ridiculous?
that language is the reason of violence?
There was another story of cruelness recorded in Karachi, terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
Wherever one could do something, he did everything. Reports on the media are 50% of what has happened here in four days.
Stayed awake in the last four nights and still afraid.
Who evacuated hotels, killed cobblers peanut sellers.
causing depredation on Super highway and cutting off ears of the innocents are all not aware of the punishment of Allah, which will catch them one day.
In your opinion, what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
Placing in front of us the heart struck attacks of Bombay, we certainly do not have to dive to find the reasons for this disturbance in Karachi. But there is one simple and easy reason that this disturbance was the result of spilling of blood subconsciously.
It is evident that if some one will knock kneed with the father, it is not unusual for the son to get out of control.
Liaqat Ali Khan and many devotees also belonged to there,for correcting the misunderstanding of Mr. Psycho I am quoting a verse
We also will follow our ancestors
sacrificed for her existence and will sacrifice to save her.
Faizan Taufiq Siddiqui
It is very sad, the whole country is at stake while we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui for your kind information if Wikipedia.
org is searched for Liaqat Ali Khan, you will know that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family of an area of Punjab Karnal.
Due to his services for Muhajirs, they consider him their leader.
Every action has got a reaction.
Till our own is bearable but.
Ejaz Aiwan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan, they did not face any reaction.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
Only Muslim League (N) was left, she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to Peoples Party.
Before this MQM and Muslim League (Q) has already submitted the draft of 18th amendment in assembly and senate.
Till now it appears that 18th amendment was a political move and none of the party is sincere in its approval.
This is why nobody has raised voice in the favor of this amendment in senate or assembly and neither forced the House to approve the amendment.
It seems that by submitted the draft of 18th amendment these parties has beaten around the bushes means they can claim that we had submitted the amendment but the ruling party's speaker did not proceed.
MQM an ally of government, Muslim League (N) secret friend and Muslim League (Q) has approved the 17th amendment, then how is it possible that they are sincere in removing 17th amendment.
It is like painting red to be counted amongst martyred.
Peoples Party is not what so ever in a hurry to remove 17th amendment.
Nobody can think of cutting his own hands.
As long Zardari is President 17th amendment will be there.
It was majority's opinion in our one survey and a fact too.
If 17th amendment ought to be removed then Zardari wont become president.
Now he is more powerful then President Pervez as along with the President he is the Chairman of Peoples Party.
Till he is president 17th amendment is there.
For removing 17th amendment political parties has to depart President Zardari from President house first.
Neither MQM wants it nor the other parties.
most of the elders from our family belonged to the labor community.
in our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor work, we used to pray to Allah: that please save us from this hard labor work.
to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what should we do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor work.
the editor wrote in reply that we should select certain subjects and become doctors or engineers.
right from beginning my trend was towards engineering and I had selected technical drawing instead of Biology in metric as well.
but at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.
I studied Biology for hardly a month and then when nothing worked out, I took maths as an alternate subject.
means that the fear from labor work made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.
I remembered that when I along with my two sons were trying to remove the carpets from our old house.
It was only half an hour since he started working that the little boy said " Daddy, I am not born to do this"
I said that if this is true then study a lot like us and get rid of the physical labor.
The son said, "I am studying and I will get through it also but it is the work that I can not do"
Whatsoever we did that work in three hours  and came back home.
The point of saying is that if a person picks his destiny, whatever is the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving that destiny.
Here if you do not know what you have to do then God help you!
It is said that don't accuse the dead, but can't help it as we see only evils in her on the first anniversary of Benazir.
On one side Benazir crushed independence movement of Sikhs by handing over the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India for her own sake and on the other hand provided India an opportunity to fully concentrate in Kashmir after crushing the movement in Punjab.
The greed of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years.
During her exile Benazir continued to give negative statements on Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir made a deal with Pervez Musharraf while betraying the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif.
During her reign Benazir provided her husband the opportunity of making money and because of this he popularized as Mr. 10 percent.
Benazir brother was killed during her reign whose assassins are still safe.
Though a woman still Benazir avoided to fight for the rights of women.
Just like Benazir politicized her father's dead body similarly his widower husband politicizing her dead body.
Benazir reigned twice but not only she failed to punish her father's political murder but could not file a case against them.
it has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
what should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated 16th December as a didactic day and take such measures that this kind of incident don't take place again.
on this day we could send greeting to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again.
the rulers would reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Bahari's stuck in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines of life from the next day.
Only if East and West Pakistan could be one together just like East and West Germany was united once again.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be granted in the near future.
Today when it was told in the news that Governor of American State Illinois has been arrested for charges of corruption
and to remove him from governorship provincial Congress is preparing for his rapid accountability, our American friend who has a keen interest in Pakistani affairs exaggeratedly said to me 'see this is democracy'.
No one is beyond the law in America.
and here is your country Pakistan whose president was dropped of the corruption charges before sworn in.
My sense of humor rouse and I said what's strange if a governor has been arrested in America, in our Pakistan prime minister was arrested overnight and once was hanged and second time was exiled.
Tell me, has it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan the country law breaker has been departed from President House with guard of honor, tell me has it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan Chief Justice has been dismissed as despite of public support he is not reinstated yet, has this ever happened in America?
In Pakistan fake degree holder has become the Health Minister, did this happen in America?
By hearing this American laughed like mads and also accepted his defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by Americans from all sides.
It seems from his smile
that America is with his government. But he is forgetting that last year the same people was with Parvez Musharaf.
This picture has been taken as it was a family gathering
A photo like this was never published in the papers before; one president with three American officials.
It seems the American involvement in Pakistan has increased and more than one official is needed to do the job; or they are not relying on their new puppet the way they relied on the one before him.
This could also have been arranged keeping in mind the stories of President Zardari’s breach of commitments.
If it had been a sensible ruler, at least he would not have been grinning during the photo session and he would have had a subservient and embarrassing look on his face.
If the principle of democracy is applied on this picture then Present Zardari is in minority.
In democracy, majority rules the country and the picture reveals the actual rulers.
The scenic Swat valley is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
The government’s policy so far is to engage in talks besides the use of force.
But the use of force is achieving nothing other than strengthening the Taliban and increase in public sympathies for them.
What is needed of the government is to address the root cause of this menace instead of using force.
With the root causes addressed, Fazalullah and Taliban will die out themselves.
The Shariat Bill by the ANP government will help to address the problem to a great extent.
But the government must address the financial problems in addition to the implementation of Shariat.
from the early steps of General Musharaf, it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians, but the lust of power changed all his plans.
all the hopes were from the participation in the "war of terror", he had started considering himself as immortal.
those steps which were expected, all broke-off.
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, he made a deal with the thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army but never know what's happening to the present government.
Either its Bajor or Swat, the army does not control terror but bombs the "Enemy" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy a mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy.
The conditions in the  terrorism struck area Swat in the Frontier Province are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area
On the one side the governments writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side the effect of Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everday in Swat.
On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.
The result is that on the one side the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other hand the Taliban has established their hold.
In between who got grinded, the poor citizens.
It is said that in Swat somebody asked, which type of people are the Taliban's are? The answer was  "very good people because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country".
Then asked how is Army, the answer was that the Army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.
Then it was asked, who are the enemies of religion and country, the answer was "the citizens"
I am astonished, how the Pakistan Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban's.
They are unable to track the illegal FM radio channel of Taliban. I think that can easily be tracked.
This FM radio is strongly propagating the agenda of hatred and terror.
After the girls school, now they are demolishing the schools for boys.
curfew is imposed to facilitate the taliban's movement
Today night during curfew, they have made new bunkers in the nearby areas of Mangora.
Question arises, how did they reach there during curfew?
If Army can kill Akbar bugti in a cave, why taliban can't be targeted.
For God's sake, Army should take actions to free the helpless people of Swat from the brutal occupation of Taliban. This will improve the image of Pakistan Army.
He says, maximum bloodshed has been done on the base of religion, you tell me in the absence of any religion wont bloodshed occur?
Punjabi, Pathan. white and black, Mehsud and other tribes, are all these created by religion?
Not at all, sir, religion preaches us that there is no white, black, Punjabi or Muhajir, if there is no religion then half of the world would have been destroyed by the war of black and white and remaining half by the war of cast.
Actually religion nourishes human morally and restricts him that he is not here at his own rather is sent by The Creator of Universe and he has to live by God's rules.
As a Muslim I believe that Islam is true religion and a complete code of life.
After living in London, for many years I used to ask wellness of my family over the telephone every morning. Although many did not even call once to find out how we were. Then I realized that they do not even tolerate our phone calls so we stopped calling.
Living here in France for the last two years, I have also felt the same thing.
Do not know why people expect us to call.
A resolution passed about Iraq in a few hours, Darfar has absolutely no problem in sending peace army.
Bombay attacks were condemned in no time and banning dubious groups is only a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are doing consensus.
O caretakers of international peace! life is finishing here!
Is it for real that every one is waiting for its end?
So that no other victim will even think about using a great damage causing weapon like a sling shot to fight for his rights?
Doesn't your hear ache even when a father is running holding his son's dead body?
If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
But you are a shame to the name of humanity.
At least this was proven that this area was also Israel's country for thousands of years.
What should happen is that both the nations should live together happily and with love but since they are controlled by the west and arab countries, therefore peace can not be formed here with out their consent.
But even Iran wants to fight its proxy war here now.
Even if operations in Israel are stopped for the time being, they will start again after some other incident.
The interests of BBC homeland are affiliated to America and Israel and this is why under the wrapper of 'broadmindedness' it has produced a series of blogs consisted of 'Jewish favor' and is conducting one sided and blind 'propaganda'.
BBC is only carrying the 'formality' and its objective is to have sympathies!
It is requested to Mr. Moderator that he must publish this review so that it may be proved BBC has element of realism to some extent.
Thanks.
I don't know how this story was imitated but one is sure that dracolla of every age is thirsty of human blood.
There were wars and bloodshed in every era of history.
It is strange that man of 21st century, which claim more civilized, does not show any concern over open bloodshed.
How does he not feel that what is happening around is a distorted/worst face of humanity.
The most tragic aspect: how the current face of civilized man will present the concept of humanity to next generations.

At the moment in Dera Ghazi khan and in other parts of the country, it is raining.
here is a poem according to the weather, enjoy the weather along with this poem.
These rains are with your presence.
if it rains, its spring
if it stays then its peace
sometimes comes without a reason
at times spread over day and night
sometimes very noisy and sometimes very quiet
These rains are with your presence.
in a memory, at a night
to a buried ash
Sometimes we blew out the flames.
Sometimes we burnt ourselves.
Sometimes every drop is like pain.
And these rains are only because of you.
All these leaders are going to run away with their briefcases in hand, what do they care about what will happen to the country.
Let the population sell toothpaste or clean the bells of the Mandir with the peels of lemons.
And then our media is also fraudulent like our leaders.
The purpose of it is to get money out of the government, and nothing else.
And as far as the population goes they can remain stupid because talking about them would be an even bigger stupidity.
Yesterday noon strange thing happened.
The whole police was running here and there but was least bothered about illegal parking.
Not this, NYPD traffic was not in the mood of noticing illegally parked vehicles.
What happened was, an airplane of US Air crash landed in the Hudson River.
Till now the only information pulled out was, ""the terrorists"" were of goose breed.
Yesterday it might be the historic cold in New york.
The temperature does not fall to this extent.
My jaw start to ache because of half an hour outside walk.
Just imagine what would have happened with those who jumped of the plane into the river.
A matter of relief as all the people were safe.
The dark side is that the Company's plane crashed in this financial crises.
While watching all this I went to New Jersey by West Side Highway. I Noticed that South Bound is blocked, still what I did?
Yes, I was jammed in it on my way back.
Thanks God,during my an hour trip the road was bit cleared as I get an exit from 56 street.
Otherwise I did not avail the first two exit due to the long lanes of vehicles.

For no reason, we thought that the Taliban group from Sawat was non religious, who were only against women education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
But like majority of the ideas, this was not proven right also. According to this news of CNN, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a Boys school with gunpowder.
Swat, The Taliban has destroyed a boys school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Amen, then Amen.
Masha Allah, up till now, 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom of fixing marriages before birth among Muslims, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See a picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
just a while before this, the wedding of a dog with a girl took place.
look at that groom.
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
Today is the age of computer and computer's interference is growing in every aspect of life.
Lots of people have many reservations about this growing interference of computer like in financial issues.
As you have facilities for using credit cards but by this law enforcement agencies has also firmer grip on your private life.
That just by tracking the record of your credit card you can be exposed.
And in future when use of currency will be minimal its utility will increase.
Similarly in crimes world there is no need to rob the bank, information of credit card are hacked.
Similarly friendship has become computerized
, social networking websites like Orcet, Facebook and MySpace are ranked first in popularity.
But don't you feel that the more closer we are getting of these sites mentally, practically moving further away from people.
Similarly there is the website of match making, where by knowing your choice you are provided with a list of people according to your likings.
Can you spend life with your own cologne (of course not physical)?
I can't do it, that is why a life partner is known as better half.
That he/she may cover my deficiencies.
Perhaps I received a lesser share of wisdom.
From childhood, I thought of everything as being true if it was told by an elder.
In the same way, I was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world.
I was even ridiculed a lot on this
But only that saying seemed true which could be possible.
Become much irritation because what was the reason to tell lie?
Bore loss on that saying even at this age
So it is my effort to say lie the very least.
Do not misguide someone by lieing and that also by attaching Allah's name.
and Allah willing say only when there is pray to Allah that work completes.
Remaining Allah knows better the state of intention.
This is a disgusting problem which is created due to reason of distance from religion.
According to law of both our Pakistan and religion, minor child should stay with mother.
Their expense is due to their father and father can meet with children.
Then when the kids get mature, they can live with anyone they want.
You have rightly said about the misunderstandings relatives create.
Our behavior is over taken by feudal thinking
Ever here this way of thinking is working that new co-sharers will be born in father's property and this is where the opposition is shown. Otherwise their father's this behavior is worth praise and pursuance.
With reference to relationships, these forceful affiliation has created evil in our society.
Concept of marriage of a divorced or a widow is ending.
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason family breakups.
In our society, if wife of a 50-55 year old man or husband of a woman goes to the next world and he marries again, why is he not respected?
There is a Pakistani uncle living close to us, his wife passed away around 10-12 years ago. Now after all his children got married, he married a widow, for which his kids have turned against him.
In my point of view, it is their religious right, what do you say?
What type of mentality is the 'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place', kind of mentality?
In my opinion the children of this person should think that after having married all the kids, is there anything wrong in his marrying a widow?
This way the widow gets a caretaker and uncle also gets someone who will take care of his home.
Because his children would certainly be busy in their worldly affairs and would not be having time for him.
The reason behind this is ignorence.
In future what if their wives refused to work for the old man?
This is the outcome of the social pressure.
Childeren feel ashamed on the second marriage of their father when people make jokes of such family on this action.
Where as they must face the circumstances and say that what their father did,it was just according to Islam.
This is a curse in our society in which we are sunk since last 40 to 50 years.
Even a wife is agreed on the unethical activities of her husband but does not allow her for second marriage.
If she had the power She wont allow him of this even after her death.
Along with husband spoils her afterlife too and causes an increase in corruption in society.
Nothing happens with singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.
And about your question, when sir instead of bringing his wife home, goes to someone else's wife so the dependents just make a fuss for the show and stay quiet and satisfied. ( yeah, later the relatives of the wife get angry)
In IndopPak we embraced Islam centuries ago but can't get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then Islam.
Second marriage of man as ridiculous, divorce as stigma, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as disgrace and man's marriage with an elder woman as the result of her cunningness is all because of such thinking.
Moreover to copy the western nations we declare veil and worship backward.
It was easy to embrace Islam to get rid of such thinking is very difficult.
Allah bless us all the courage for it.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never that difficult.
Centuries passed in writing this little.
Consider it enough.
Allah Hafiz.
Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes that i found this secret in my life that if leader of any Army is in front line then that Army will never lose.
But here situation is else.
To say that Common people are there to die for us if we die then martyr
if someone from common people dies then murder
May Allah bless and have mercy on you.
When I was coming back to the shop after Isha prayer tonight, one man who was sitting in  car, raised his hand and asked me to come.
I thought may be this man has forgotten his way or may be he wants to ask something. I stopped so his whole family was in his car.
He asked if I can understand Arabic very well or not. I said that there is no problem. You tell me what is the matter.
He started saying, I have come from Riyadh but here some one in Medina picked my pocket if you please help me. I said forget about it.Because  this has happened with me earlier also as I gave this man 20 riyals to pay for gas and go back to Riyadh but he started doing the same thing after moving forward a little.
I got really angry and when I told him and threaten him of a cop, he vanished from there.
So now this is the condition of us Muslims that even when we come to beg money, we come with families riding in cars and daily manage to get at least 2 to 3000.
Although there is an evident saying of the Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the hand above is better than the hand below and the hand above is the giving hand the lower is the taking hand.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims ( Amen)
Wassalam

The wife of famous singer Adnan Sami reached went to police station for blaming him of torturing her
, police has advised her to consult the court.
Saba Galadari wife of Adnan Sami has filed an application against him that Adnan Sami continuously tortures her
and behaves inhumanly,
Now she is fed up of this therefore case must be filed against him
, in place of filing case police asked her to consult the court by saying that this case is not under the jurisdiction of police.
In your opinion the blame of Adnan Sami's wife on him is true?
Is it not an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Do inform us with your opinion in this regard.
Adam Sanghar, Meher
As far as the allegations are concerned, anyone can levy them on any other person.
There is nothing superior to honor.
Whatever is the current state of relations between Adnan Sami and his wife, Adnan Sami left his respectable life and went to India to earn a fortune. The same fame has now importuned him.
It is the outcome of his wrong doings.
Washington
American high officials have stated that President Obama will take a stern attitude towards the Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
The new American strategy towards Afghanistan will focus on war instead of development
The officials said that Hamid Karzai is being viewed as an obstacle in achieving American interests in Afghanistan because of government corruption and drug trafficking is on the rise and the Talibans are gaining strength
The American officials also said that those people in the current administration who are pressurizing Hamid Karzai to do more include, Vice President Joe Biden and American Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrook
He said that this good administration was noticed after the President Bush left, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai after every 2 weeks and used to emphasize on the role of America in Afghanistan and the development of its city departments.
Officials say that Obama management will work with the state leaders as a backup with the main government.
Officials say that they will emphasize Hamid Karzai on fighting against corruption
Hamid Karzai faces new elections this year. And it is not clear as yet that Obama and his companions will favor his presidency or not.
Is this statement, of the American officials, a forecast of change in American policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is this era of Hamid Karzai ending?
What are your thoughts in this matter?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and SriLanka, Srilanka defeated Pakistan with 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Srilanka in the first one-day match although Srilanka won in the next two matches.
In this third one-day match, the nation's team performance was very poor. They worn out in only 75 runs in 23 overs against 309 runs made by the national team of Srilanka.And this is how we faced a lesson learning defeat.
the result of the series proves that the National team has no consistency in its performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
which departments of the game should be addressed more by the authorities?
are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
which department you will hold responsible for the defeat, fielding, batting or bowling?
please provide your feedback.
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish  traditions continue. these feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule, who would call them Muslims?
a Sardar should walk himself over these embers. why the present government do not act against them?
when the judicial justice will come in handy.
the Srilankan cricket team has arrived Karachi to play One Day internationals.
Despite the tensions between Pakistan and India it is nice to see a foreign team visit Pakistan.
On reaching the Karachi airport the Sirilankan team was given a warm welcome.
There will be two one day matches in Karachi and one in Lahore between Pakistan and Sirilanka.
There have been bold statements from both sides regarding their bowling, batting and fielding.
If the Sirilankans are proud of their spinners than Pakistan has its fast bowlers.
The Sirilankan captain Mahela Jayawardene has said that no one player of the Pakistan team can be singled out as a threat, the whole team is dangerous.
Muralitharan and Mendis are said to be trump cards while the Pakistani captain has said that the competition will be a tough one.
Shoaib Malik said that they've already played Muralitharan and that they'll see off Mendis as well, he also said that they've got a secret game plan that they'll reveal on the pitch.
Can it really be that according to the Pakistani and Sirilankan claims the contest will be a gripping one?
Who will have the upper hand when the series between Pakistan and Sirilanka gets underway?
who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Let us know of your opinion.
Gulfam, London, Publish statements that are of liking, you give preference to those too, it is our wish that even you write some truth, do not entangle the statement like Mukher Jee because it is commanded to say truth in front of tyrant and it is equal to Crusade(Jihad). What to say of Mukher Jee, change the statement between news and try to weep.

It is all these people's doing Kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years.
No, no one  asked, now they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism so they have started talking about peace and settlement.
First they generally massacred Muslims now they are perplexedly settling the matters.
In any way Pakistan has to understand their duplicitous policies.
Asad Khan: London
India is making situations so that the Kashmir situation is overlooked.
But Pakistan has always shown India's true face to the world.
Even the British government is now understanding this, that is why India is now ruining Pakistan's reputation by terrorism accusations to distract from the Kashmir situation.
And hesitates to talk with Pakistan about this.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that by resolving the issue of Kashmir will bring an end to extremism, the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
it should be clear that the newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister while talking to media in Mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Does India want to the allegations of terrorism its escape goat to avoid peace talks?
Tell us your opinion.

I think Super powers don't want to destroy Pakistan
rather they are thinking of certain policies to control her they are familiar that Pakistan is an atomic power
want to bring some sort of revolution
Foreign countries believe that by cornering Pakistan few hurdles may generate want to support Pakistan and also wish to achieve their goal

Hindus always hit hard and then start speaking sweet.
I think that they get problems often in a while and they start threatning Pakistan.
We are ready from each aspect.Indian army chief should better shut his mouth up else we are capable to cross attacking.
F.M. siddique
Political statements are coming under the mischievous support of America. America is crazy and now Indians are going on the same pattern. if India has courage to attack, it should to know the ground reality.
Israel is attacking Hamas and no one has courage to stop Israel. Following Israel, Indian also wants to do some adventure.
PM said that Byden had a great role in shedding Musharraf's uniform and restoring the democracy. That is why he has awarded SI.
No political party can get the credit of uniform shedding and the restoration of democracy. Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in Parliament.
PM said that Dr. Qadir's chapter had closed.
If public protest against dictatorship has no significance to you?.
If lawyers movement did not play any role?
what will you going to do at Prime Minister's statement
please give us your opinion
American President George W Bush in his last Press conference advises newly elected President that he did many mistakes in his tenure and Barack Obama should do what he think is right
I as the President and according with the constitution of USA and law i did the developments, i put forward American interest on my own popularity.
he said that America's Enemy are still planning to attack America. the biggest challenge for Barack Obama is to prevent from these attacks
he said that , unable to find the weapon of mass destruction from Iraq was his major dissapointment and to announce the mission completed in Iraq was his big mistake.
In last press conference from white house American president has said that this is my last press conference i thank u all news reporter and my colleague who attended this conference
do you think Obama will not do that mistake which bush did?
don't you think bush was late in accepting his mistakes?
will Obama be able to follow the advice of Bush?
Give us your opinion.

The Indian President Manmohan Singh has again accused Pakistan of hyping the talk of war.
And that Pakistan uses terrorism as its state policy.
While deliberating to the Chief Ministers Manmohan Singh stated that terrorist elements were being housed in neighboring countries such as Pakistan.
And that during the Mumbai attacks the terrorists used the sea route and managed to elude the coast guard.
The Indian president stated that the Mumbai attacks were carried out by the Lashkar-e-Tayyebah.
He continued that the terrorists were using new techniques and advanced equipment and that the security on the line of control should also be increased so that infiltration of these things could be stopped, he also stated that terrorism shall never be tolerated by the Indian government and that was their policy.
In what light do you see these accusations made by the Indian President?

It is extremely sad that the Israelis are openly killing Palestinians. Over here, Kashmir is in the same situation but the Peace Council does not even turn a ear over it.
All the groups that are in Kashmir and Palestine, should keep the war going for freedom, and unitedly fight any force that opposes them. One day their martyrdom will bear fruit, God willing.
Israeli air attacks are still continued on Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
The important leader of Hamas Nazaar Rayyan and family has been martyred.
The Security Council session ended without any decision.
America has opposed the censure resolution against Israel submitted by Lebia and other Arab countries in the session.
Israeli airplanes bombardment is continued since many days on Palestinian civil population.
The whole world reacted on Mumbai attacks but no country including America and England can see bloodshed caused by Israeli attacks.
Why the major countries of Muslim world are silent?
What will you wish to say on this double standard of the world.

In my opinion, the basic fact is that most of our people are uneducated and they don't even know where their money is actually going. Government is interested in doing it's job properly by applying and collecting taxes. Shortfall of electricity and gas will continue in the same manner.
Because everyone knows about the character of those who have been elected by our own nation.
The crisis of electricity and gas has worsen in whole of the Pakistan
, on the other hand gas prices have been raised by average 8, while in few cities unavailability of petrol created immense worry for people.
Intense reactions, riots and torturous demonstration are continued in the industrial and business circles of Pakistan against the crisis of electricity and gas.
Industrialists have threatened a shutdown ultimatum.
In Karachi people are worried due to 8 to 10 hours load shedding.
Industrial sector is almost paralyzed.
Government Institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other.
Increasing the prices of electricity and gas is not a joke with people?
Why the solutions of the problems are not considered?
Is government not seeing the full stop on national development?
What steps you will instantly recommend for managing this crisis?

Imran Khokar from Madīnah Munawwarah, “I would like to say that rulers are a reflection of society’s morality.
I am surprised that a government claiming to be people’s friendly is unfriendly to the people.
Non-Availability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a menace.
The government does not have any control over the institutions.
The law and order situation is worsening day by day. May Allah have mercy on the country.

the Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, in an interview with Jeev News said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour, but due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step? Should sports not be separated from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision not harmful for cricket?

Salman, Karachi
Those people who are proud about going to India
and they make their films and videos over there, their eyes should open now, as to how much the people of India respect you.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami should return to Pakistan first chance he gets because respect did not suit you there either.

Indian's attitude has changed after Bombay Attacks.
Jagjit Singh has showed his reaction in this way that he hates Pakistan and Pakistani.
One should know that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsley. How is he a bad singer now? Adnan Sami Should stay in India, there is not need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshaad Alam
Karachi, On the statement of Jagjit Singh, I would only say that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Bombay incident, there hateful statements have increased. The same people are now saying evil against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to foreign news agency the situation has become funny when President Bush along with Prime Minister Noor Almalki in press conference at his office in Baghdad when an Iraqi journalist said to President Bush, ""Dog, this is farewell kiss"".
After this journalist removed his shoe and threw it at Bush, President bush expertly moved his head out of the way and saved himself.
Second shoe hit the American flag.
Security officials dragged him out of there.
On this occasion President Bush said I don't know why he did this, shoe was of size 10, I was not bothered.
Do you think that this action by the journalist depicts the anger of Iraqi people against President Bush.
What will you say about this?

Its true that they were killed but we feel sorry that they killed many innocent people in Karachi,at which they feel proud that Naseer Ullah Baber did a good job
But later,changed at all.
But it's also true that they ignored the seniors of their party and nominated their own son as the representative of People's Party.What sort of democracy is it?
Jimmy Noor,Karachi,This news has proved Quran's statement that a non Muslim will actually help an other non Muslim.
But if the iron axe doesnt contains the handle,it can' cut any thing.
Our leaders own these styles,they are adopting secret ways,that's why our country is suffering with hardships.
May Allah Almighty show the right path to our leaders.

Karachi, our leaders should understand this that people, they are doing the operation against, are the true valuers of Pakistan, who are tolerating all kinds of tortures but they love Pakistan.
If there would be war then they will fight for Pakistan.
When their love would be felt, just condenming politics will not work. I think between both, there might be going a resulting war.
