   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reid who has worked in the Lever national laboratory of America as a Weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the Ex director of technical intelligence at Las Elmos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.</seg>
    <seg id="3">this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.</seg>

    <seg id="6">the reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">he further added that this was the reason that in 1998 only in a span of two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments as a reply to Indian nuclear experiments.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that in May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with a lot of care and Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reed was asked this question that China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan so he said in his answer that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that its evidence is also present that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan has used the Chinese model. Later the documents received from Libya also confirm this.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Another question that is it common to do nuclear experiments mutually. Then he said that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that we also predict that Israel also has access to the results of this experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reeds was also asked if China is continuing nuclear proliferation?</seg>
    <seg id="15">On this Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and the design to a nuclear facility of Iran in its city Asfahan.</seg>
