'first nuclear experiment was done in 1990'
Thomas Reid who has worked in the Lever national laboratory of America as a Weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the Ex director of technical intelligence at Las Elmos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.
this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.
in an interview with US news, Thomas Reid said that in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's rule, China experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Thomas Reid said that based to many reasons, he has a belief that China had experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
the reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.
he further added that this was the reason that in 1998 only in a span of two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments as a reply to Indian nuclear experiments.
Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiment.
He added that the atom bomb that was tested on May 19th 1998 by Pakistan was made very carefully and that Pakistani scientists had complete reliance on it.
When Thomas Reid was asked whether China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said because India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.
He said that there was proof available that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and later on the documents which were received from Libya also verify this fact.
Upon another question, as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.
He said that we also believe that Israel also has access to the results of this testing.
Thomas Reid was also asked about China's nuclear distribution program which is going on.
Upon that Thomas Reid said that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Asfahan, Iran since 1991.

It was the saying of the Republican parties, that this economic plan was very expensive and that it would not be successful.
Among the representatives of the houses, 240 votes were given in favor of the plan, while 188 votes were given against it.
This economic reform plan has to be produced in the Senate next week, where the ruling Democratic party has a very normal majority.
It is being feared that due to opposition from the republican party, it's passing in the senate may not be easy.
After the passing of the economic reform plan among the representatives of the houses, Barack Obama said to the members, forcing them, that they should not let political differences get in the way of this important plan.
The President said that plan, which he hoped would become law by next month would prove helpful in creating a suitable environment in the country, because of which business would prosper in the country.
According to this plan, the common man and the businessmen would be relieved of 275 trillion Dollars of debt, and 540 trillion Dollars would be given for fixing roads, bridges and ten thousand schools and for unemployment allowance and research on new technology.

Bitterness between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Israeli president, almost screaming, that the blood of many humans were spilled in Gaza, and it saddened him to see that people could watch this armed killing from Israel and clap in agreement.
Mr. Erdogan said that "I believe that you are using such words to erase your guilty feeling, and outloud, that too. But you killed those people, and I am remembering those children who were killed near the shore."
Simon said that Gaza's calamity is not Israel, but Hamas, who have established a dangerous dictatorship over there.
A BBC journalist from Davos said that he had never seen such a scene in an global economic forum before.
However, Erdogan later stated that he respected the Israeli president and his age, which is why he did not scream at him, but whatever he was saying was very far from the truth
Turkey is one of the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, but for the last few years there has been tension between them.
The attacks were not planned in Pakistan.
Speaking to Indian news channel, NDTV, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said that the report of the Pakistani investigations into the Mumbai blast will be prepared soon.

The high commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan gave his first statement about the report of the Pakistani investigations, from which it becomes evident as to what is within the report.
Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that as far as investigation has gone, Pakistani land has not been used.
It must be some other place, not England either.
these are the two places (Pakistan and Britain) about which I was worried.
India and the international community has created a lot of pressure on Pakistan to take actions against the culprits of the Mumbai attacks.
Wajid Shamsul Haq said: we are not trying to cover it up.
we believe in taking action based on facts.
the world will accept our investigations.
we will try to satisfy India over the results (of the investigation)
while defending the delay in the investigation is Pakistan he said that it takes time to collect, understand and check these kind of stuffs.
The High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Haq said that it took 45 days for India to present its dossier.

There are reports of the presence of militants in the Ponch province of Jammu
According to government sources, upon receiving secret reports, the police and the army have surrounded the region and have started searching.

Umar Abdullah will be administered the oath as the chief minister of the state tomorrow.
Note that in the recently held state elections, the National Conference got 28 out of the 87 seats of the parliament, coming forth the biggest party. It should be clear that separatist groups boycotted the elections.
Congress, which got 17 seats, was prepared to form a joint government with the National Conference.
Today, upon reaching Srinagar, Umar Abdullah was jubilantly greeted by the party members.
On this occasion, Umar Abdullah said that he would try to play a role in generating dialog between the Indian government and separatists. However, this would not be possible until the elections took place and the new government came to power in India.
The role of the European Union in peace making in the Middle East.
from official point of view, the role of European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
according to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
European Union's spokesman Amadeu Altafaj has said that every such effort is adorable which is helpful in sending the European Union's message to the opponents of the war.
it seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned.
but in reality the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
as the head of the Union, Czech republic's role is even weaker than before.
an on top of that the internal issues have made is helpless.
on the other hand the French president Sarkozy is behaving like if he is still the president of the European Union.
Whereas France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it.
the most funny situation is faced by the French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner.
he is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of Czech republic Schwarzenberg.
the problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the Middle East war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. moreover Germany has sent its special ambassador to Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance, it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.
its proof is the Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.
this is a golden chance for the European Union to do something since America due to the policies of George W. Bush has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial Crisis: Suicide of a billionaire German industrialist.
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany left a huge business group behind him.
but a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 to one Billion Euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle went into deep pressure.
Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had got to this position from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic powet.
After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quick, putting it on new lines.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm, Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have sanctioned 400 million Euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.
this way Merchlay group will stay as it has always been after the death of Adolph Merchley

According to latest statistics the rate of crime among immigrants from 2004 till 2007 is 22%.
Decline from 9 to 0.21%
has reached 4%
According to Interior minister Joachim Herrmann of province Bavaria this is a superficial positive change.

He said that his province will also consider this while collecting statistics
A part from Bavaria the same is being planned in Hamburg.
Senator for foreign affairs from CDU, Christoph Ahlhaus has said: "When research is done in a scientific manner, the man can not pre-decide its results but it is based on the facts and figures that come out as a result of the research.
Ahlhaus diverted the attention to a research report from the anti crime's provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamberg, it was investigated that out of all crimes happening there what percentage have the involvement of foreigners.
results showed that the foreigners here have
the crime rate was less as compared to the crimes allover the province.
in contrast when in 2006 a survey was done on crimes in youth in Berlin, it came up that young people having foreign background had a percentage of .44
was 7 percent
However, other political parties of Germany for example, SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei were against this proposal that while collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired that which German citizen has a foreign background.

Therefore if America wants to save its image, it will have to stop its support of Israel and have to disassociate itself from Israel's crimes.

why reduce exercise with the age?
new research
exercise at any age is good for health.
it energizes your heart, reduces the cholesterol level, helps in keeping the weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer or dementia.
unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.
experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.
Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.
She lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.
The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart.
In which the pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.
The experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood.
They learnt that as people grew old, there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.
Dr. Patricia says that as age increases, the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear, and this affects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garwin  Cain was also a part of this study.
He says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this. And this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart.
some times blood pressure can cause disorders in heart's functions and heart diseases.
if the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard, then they can take advantage of the benefits of exercise even with the age.
a detailed report in this matter is published in a magazine of American Medical Association.
No chances of an immediate war with Pakistan: Indian Army chief
Indian Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan how ever we are always ready to defend our country and sacrifice our lives for it.
He has accused that despite of commitments and international pressure on Pakistan as a result of Mumbai attacks, the infrastructure of terrorism is not only existent but also proactive in Pakistan.
he said this while talking to the correspondents in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day tour to the valley of Kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in New Delhi administered Kashmir and preparation of armed forces on the borders.
He was asked a question, that according to the media reports Pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from India regarding the Mumbai attacks, what were his thoughts about it.
General Kapoor said that the decisions of peace or war matters are taken by the political leadership.
Mentioning the proven presence of a terrorism structure in Pakistan, he said that the Indian army would face such groups which are trying to disturb peace and are bent upon weakening India.
He said that in Indian Kashmir, at least 700 to 800 militants are present, of which approximately half are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that with an improvement in the seasonal weather, there might be an increase in infiltration from Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. However, India has increased the guard at the borders.
He refuted the possibility of decrease in the army posting in Kashmir, saying that there can be no compromise with regards to national security.
May Allah bless the tongues of the world and may Barack become a blessing for the world.
Though it was not expected, still we shall see how this change  will work out in our favor with regards to Pak-American relations.
And what Barack Obama, who is the result of Martin Luther Kings dreams, gives to the world.
Obama, part of whose name is Husain, taking the oath today, as the American President, is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance, but also a historic test.
Not only for himself, but also for all the people who supported him.
It will even be a test for the white majority, as for them to accept from their hearts, a black governing over them is no easy task.
Those here in South Asia, especially the Muslims, who have hopes about him, should remember that he was elected the president of America, and Obama should remember that the president of America is actually the president of the world.
A little while from then, a person whose real brothers were brought to America from their own countries, wearing the neckband of slavery,and whose blood and sweat watered the roots of the strongest country of the new era, today the a representative of that very same targeted lineage will be called the 44th President.
Many people have many expectations from this man.
It is necessary for those who admire him that they do not make unrealistic expectations about him.
If Obama is even successful in somewhat reducing the hate that is spread on lineage and religion based lines, it will be a victory for his admirers.
What effect will this change have on South Asia, and what considerable change can be expected in the American policy in this regards?
How will these changes affect Pakistani-American relations?
?
My Sir, whether it be Obama or someone else, the type of policies with regards to the whole world is decided by the multi-billionaire, influential, strong Jewish lobby.
As for Pakistan, with regards to the recent Mumbai blasts, the injurious actions taken by India, Israel and America has been seen by the whole world.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat, who had a regular Army and Law.
He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a  pact
but it is matter of sorrow that our government treated Swat like a step mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government of the ruler of Swat.
and no interest was taken in the building and development works
The girls who are getting education today are much lesser in number than  those who used to get educated in the previous era.
In the Frontier Province, there is a continuous targeting of educational institutions by Taliban's.
The maximum number of schools have been destroyed in district Swat in which majority are the girls schools.
It is not just this, the Taliban has imposed a ban on girl education.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.
what do you think, by stopping girls' education, what the Taliban want to achieve?
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities so far.
what do you think the government should do.
the question should be that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
because the people of Swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them, otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that during the Curfew. How come people can be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing.
when the writ of the government is not being let implemented, how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities?
now the question arises that having an armed force, armed with modern weapons, modern technologies and intelligence system, why the government can not control these few Taliban.
the only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head, that neither their arms end nor they are apprehended.
result of the discussion is that Taliban with their wrong steps are making it easier for the imperialists.
fifteen years before the war was continued in Afghanistan.
ISI used to control the Taliban when there was the opposition from the Northern Alliance, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then, suddenly the situation changed and Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of Dollars from America, so the previous friend became an enemy.
Now the situation has changed but the war is still going on and those supporting them in Pakistan are still Russia, India and Iran.
Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.
For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play Holi with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings
The question is that, is war, armed resistance and terrorism the solution to problems?
If not, then what is the magic recipe that will bring out a solution to the problems?
This is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but rather it puts 'blessings' in them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development, that Nelson Mandela had used in South Africa.
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
From the Kashmiris taking part in the elections, it looks as if they have accepted this view point.
It is the third week of Israeli attacks on Gaza and the number of deaths have gone close to a thousand.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date, a ceasefire was not possible.
According to another report, since the start of attacks, on the 27th of December, 90,000 Palestinians have left their homes and moved towards safer locations.
Here, aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, and said that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victim of grave psychological and emotional difficulties.
What do you say?
What should happen?
how is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Taliban should be given a chance
basit, Peshawar
Please wakeup, if the Taliban start doing the real Jihad, then who will kill the innocent people.
Who will burn down the girls' schools?
who will do kidnapping for ransom or if ransom not paid then blame people of being American agents and hang them on the towers?
these Taliban have brought such damage to Islam that no nation or religion has ever brought.
Pashtoon Rore
Kohat, Pakistan
if the whole Muslim world just give a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see that how upset will its father America be.
and immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well.
but what can be done, where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from.
someone tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step as he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
the responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on Arabs and the Muslim world but its and obligation on the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny.
this unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
Just like in Pakistan and India before 30th June or the end of the fiscal year, the government institutions are looted, the American regime just before its end have given a green signal to Israel to do what ever it wants.
on one hand America says that effort will be made for ceasefire.
On the other side, the United Nation is passing one resolution over another but both have done nothing practically, this means that united nation is also working  to crush the Muslims.
All the Islamic Countries should cancel their membership of United Nations and they should lay the foundation of there own international organisation.
Many examples are in front of us, where only promises and resolutions of America and United Nations came forward but only the Muslims suffered.
What is the advantage of these actions when BBC does not have to print anything.
Now, where have the principles of general ism been buried,When the unrequired blood especially of the Muslims starts flowing, at that time the ghost of unbiased reporting starts riding over the BBC.
Otherwise portrays itself as flag bearer of righteousness.
Saying something from their side is a far away thing, they do not want even comments
from the Muslims.
The difference between you and Jews is that they call themselves Jews and Martyr the Muslims and people like you live among Muslims, by calling themselves Muslims, to Muslims
[syja786]
For a while, BBC forums have been making a certain point, sometimes while discussing suicide attacks and other times, terrorism in India.
The most used word in these anti-Islamic comments is extremism.
But, who is extremist, that you can easily figure out from the above comment.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal can not be fought with the sword?
Looking at the helpless people facing the Israel bombings, if the heart does not cry tears of blood what coes it do?
But the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that we try to use the name of Jihad to disfigure the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existece of Israel, then what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks.
The conduct of both sides is misanthropist.
The action of the United Nations and the United States seem to be supporting the Israeli wrongdoings.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
and the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism, after all they are doing the real work.
otherwise, is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are.
so in this situation, in common terms it is called DADAGEERI which means do what ever you can.
That it even hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry.
medicines for injured, and coffins for the dead are being supplied by the Arab leaders and asked that
Should the Israeli attacks take place?
this is the actual problem that the leaders of Muslim countries including Saudi crownprince are in a false sleep, neither they have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
they should take immediate measures against Israel.
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Salam to All brothers and sisters!
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is similar to considering them defeated.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature, as the steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Hamas and Israel should reconcile so that this bloodshed comes to an end.
Muhammad Sarfraz, Paris, France
Absolutely true.
Let’s suppose that Hamas is really the righteous one and they have waged Jihad against the tyranny to become successful in the divine court, even then they should at least realize that if good brings harm to the people then it is of no use
Those who claim to love God, his Messenger, and their religion; it becomes an integral part of their faith to love humanity.
So after muslims, all believers who are living on this earth should be wiped out according to the command of Allah?
Najibur Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
no there are no orders to destroy but to invite them to come to Islam.
but Jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion.
these people should be fought with unless they stop these conspiracies - but this doesn't mean at all that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering.
brothers, the only end to the killer of innocent children is destruction.
but I ask my friends that the Israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past have become so strong today that they don't listen to any one, this is because the Jews are united.
there are no Shea's and Sunnis, there are all just Jews and they have developed everything in every field.
in contrast, what is the condition of 55 Islamic countries?
they are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death.
it is essential that all Muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
and there is no better strategy, that recognize Israel, learn modern education and means of progress and let the world live in peace and harmony.
The Muslims have plenty of land and means as well.
the need is of proper use.
this first most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque and this was impossible without removing Yasin and Arafat from the way.
the world is witnessing that how Palestine had been scattering  after the death of these two leaders.
and how the Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
in 1974 a Pakistani prime minister was so worldly trusted that first time in the history he manged to gather all the Muslim leaders under one roof with hundred percent attendance.
today on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task that the whole nation promise to not only keep unity in its lines
also, while eradicating the differences between other Muslims,  its (The formation of Islamic common wealth) mission will be carried forward
its a monster that has gripped Palestine for half a century.
this monster has many faces.
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
and its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
this monster is most unhappy with Islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through Islam, Muslims, the perfect religion of Muslim and Practical Islam as the history tells that Islam has put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since 27th of December.
more that 3 hundred Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
after the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
however the Israeli authorities say that they will continue operation in Gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
in your opinion, is this claim of Israel true that it's doing all this for defending the sovereignty of Israel?
is the world community playing its role in such situation?
does this aggression has an indirect relation with the coming elections in Israel?
can any improvement be expected in the situation in Middle East after the succession of the newly elected American president Barak Obama.

BBC publishes these kind of comments after deep search.
after all a neutral impression is to be maintained.
although the news from BBC are usually correct but the real thing is the style of the news.
what should be pointed out and what news should be given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
in this art now a days the Pakistani electronic and print media, specially some Urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone, who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the "grudge of Muavia" written on them.
has said that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. how long this hypocrisy will continue.
Why is so much oppression being done on the Muslims? If people such as America stop supporting these Jews, then Allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support, and then see what kind of life they get.
The famous just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.
In the words of a poet
Oppression is oppression, that the more it's done the more it is erased.
Blood is blood, that the more it falls, the more it gathers.
Now who can tell who did terrorism?
Is all this not included in terrorism? Why does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocent not red?
And why is there no one to send a mourning message from anywhere?
I watched the progress of the Mumbai incident, as if my own house was on fire. The sorrow of humans can not be watched, and who can not see this sorrow? If only Muslims would think a bit, together.
How can words derogate the bodies strewn on the streets, helpless innocent faced people, injured and soaked in blood?
I feel like crying about the helplessness of Muslims, that on one side, people are dying in India, and the whole world is climbing onto Pakistan, without any proof and saying, take action or else we will.
And on the other side, Israel is ruthlessly killing Muslims and the whole world is silent. This is unbearable.
There is delay, but no darkness, with God. That too, when this darkness comes to pass.
The threat to Israeli sovereignty is a joke as long as it has America's backing.
As far as elections are concerned, it is not surprising that the people who are in power do such things to win the heart and mind of people especially in a state like Israel. And speaking of Barak Obama, history shows that no American president has wavered from the policy and will not do so in future. A tyrant is a tyrant whether he is white or black.
From the discussions going on in the forum, it seems that everyone is hurt over her death, but as a politician, her mistakes have not been ignored.
This issue is debatable, as to whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was dearer, why did she leave the republic for ten years in the control of Musharraf, waiting for American clearance and deal?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when people affected by dictatorship needed her. Unfortunately she came to Pakistan when she assured about government and that she will be freed from trails.
There is no one remaining to say about the criticism and accusations of a historical personality.

Somethings should be ignored because nothing can be done about them.

how brutal is our nation, not only we are blind while writing odes on ourselves and our parties but now we are picking, accusing and criticizing every historical scholar and no body is there to say any thing over this.
enough of development that we have made.
Sana Khan
few things are ignored just by thinking that nothing can be done of them. Just like a donkey can not become a scholar by just loading books over it.
although after the Mumbai attacks, there has been a setback in the dialog between Pakistan and India, however Pakistan and India should continue these dialogs.
if we talk of war then it will bring loss of humans from both sides.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu but on the other hand when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader; point to be noted.
First of all Mary Christmas to Mr. Bhana and to all the Christian brothers of the forum.
greeting to all friends of the Forum: Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, sister Sana, sister Shahida and Mr. Akram.
we do not want the flames of fire but flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
will war give solution to problems.
it will bless with fire and blood.
will give hunger and exigence.
therefore wise humans
its better to avoid war
in yours and ours yards
its better that the glim keeps lightened
the India-America relations have deepened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
this is also the old history of America.
in case of and Indian attack, America would get its goals and the expense would be on India as well.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation and ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
this is the Islamic history.
even before this resolution the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it more clever that effected and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has relaxed its pressure now.
while ignoring India's unnecessary bobbery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a "Side Effect" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
there are no two opinions over this that it is a heinous act.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past one year?
Every day, how many Taliban die due to the firing of the thousands of mortar and canon shells they fire?
I appeal to the ICI that they stop their guardianship of the Taliban, for Gods sake, and let us live peacefully in paradise like Swat.
And they stop this fixed operation.
The day is not far, when a resolution will be passed in the United Nations, against army intervention in Pakistan, in the same way as it was passed against Jama'athud-Da'wah.
Riyaz Ahmad Farooqi
First of all, our radicalism and our protecting them, is alone, sufficient to provide complete proof and permissibility for action against us. And the very day such a resolution is passed, there is all probability that no voice will be raised in our support, in the United Nations.
And supposing the passing of such a resolution is delayed,some other strength will definitely leave our aid to ourself,, keeping the example of America in front of them.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
As the bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They command even after they die.
But there is an international game being played over here. Here, they are ruling by scaring the public about beastliness and terror.
So that it would be permissible for them, saying that if we are not there, beasts and wild people will come and capture the government.
Such actions of the so called Islam lovers, in the name of religion is extremely disagreeable.
The supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of America, but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions, give it the name of tribal traditions, and clearly avoid it.
Any person with a heart can never accept these beastly actions, which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of Islam.
I think the people of our army have joint these people.
This is because, when these people move around, at least some time will be taken. To catch them will only take so much time. But, forget about getting to that spot, even if they were there, they escape from there.
Are these people so brave that they take 50 or 70 people hostage and our army watches like an audience, with hand on hand.
They are also servants of Allah and so is the army.
It is clear that something is sinister.
Malaiyat. In the dictator of the age, Ziya-ul-Haqq's dictatorship, instead of presenting the Noble and Merciful characters of God, an atmosphere of religio-phobia was created by the use of many types of narrations of punishments and incidents apart from the incident of the body hanging. Even the literature and books like 'what will happen when we die?' created fear and terror.
And these people are only using this fear as a tool or a weapon to gain worldly pleasures and honor.
preachers!
As you have preached against the fire of Hell
that you have yourself become the face of fear.
It is surprising when it is said that this can not be a work of a Muslim
We are either unaware of our own history, or we ignore it for some reason.
Upon the death of the Prophet, upon refusing to pledge alliegance, who burnt the door of the daughter of the Messenger and pulled her husband out with a rope around his neck?
Had they come from somewhere outside?
was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
without accepting reality neither the motives can be diminished nor correction can be made.
O' BBC please stop this dual-headed policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
please show some modesty, a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office.
the success of, operation Sherdil and across the border operation Lion heart, depends on the fact that in whose favor is the opinion of general public.
this act is of American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahab is a victim of this conspiracy.
all discussions on this forum will now be anti Taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined Taliban and they are doing what can change the public opinion.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public. They even report something like this 'Bombing on Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000, in Swat went there to do.
That the bodies of the Taliban who helps the army is left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake stop this drama.
These Talibans have tarnished the Muslim image.
If in the whole world true Muslims don't call these terrorists as Muslims then how come these elements are able to live in the lands of true Muslims.
Those who become shameless, can't do hard labor they pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
There is no allowance of this in any religion or family traditions.
Including BBC all the media present their views in different styles on Taliban or the tribal people.
But no one is aware of the ground realities or what the truth is. It is us the tribal people who know what rally is the matter.
In short, its a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a talib or a tribal. Who made these institutions? Warmongers who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions.
This move has ashamed all the Muslims.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that current leadership will end this  cancer.
After Mumbai attacks India said that some extremists are behind the attacks.
Pakistan rejecting the accusations said that it will help India in investigation in every possible way.
India said that it has given a list to Pakistan that has 20 suspected extremists required by India.
Now Pakistan has said that included in the list Jaish-e-Muhammad's Molana Azhar Masood is not in custody and government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before that the president of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari refuted the view that west's secret agencies and Indian government has given evidence related to Mumbai attachs.
President Zardari has said that it has not been proved that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani.
meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned Pakistan that its relation with India can not improve unless its land is being used for terrorism.
and in a latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to Pakistan.
should these political instances affect over the sports?
what do you see as the future of Pakistan and India relations.
Neither America will break Pakistan nor India.
Pakistan will be broken by Pakistanis themselves.
what do you expect after so much provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism.
although Jinnah also did not do good to the Muslims of India and it has been proven with time.
Yasmin, Chicago.
Madam, if Mr. Jinnah's vision was followed, neither the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism had spread in Pakistan nor the Muslims in India had undergone such behavior.
but it's our fault that we could not bring up a leader like his stature.
if we can not care for our heroes, then
this region has great capabilities.
god knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
in both countries the enemies to peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv sena, RSS have been raised.
and the evil powers don't want this region to progress therefore these countries are controlled like puppets.
can you imagine what status will this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world.
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
may Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
but Sir, open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
moreover, the internal affairs don't seem to be good, as you can see the circumstances in NWFP, Balochistan and in Karachi in Sindh.
in this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
O Allah bestow your mercy upon us.
Account to my understanding, a final war is inevitable.
this is enough of it.
now it should be do or die.
this problem can not be solved through these acts of insincere dialogues.
and not through small scale terrorism in each other's country.
after all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
and if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all of our political parties are agreed on the fact that terrorism and sectarianism should be rooted out of the country.
But our military leadership does not seem sincere in this regard. On one hand they assure America and Europe that they are with them in this war against terror and on the other hand are covertly aiding the Taliban.
We should now ponder and set our direction and choose one path only. Thanks
There is no doubt that majority of the workers of Jama'athud Da'wah are the previous members of Lashkar-e-Taiba who joint the group called Jama'athud Da'wah Pakistan, after Lashkar-e-Taiba was rendered inexistent.
However, after that, the members gave preference to social work, and now even Jama'athud Da'wah was rendered inexistent by the United Nations, due to the pressure applied by India and the crackdown being enforced by the Pakistani government.
I believe that if Jihadi groups leave religious fundamentalism and take up social efforts, that would be better.
The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan are employing professional criminals in the name of Jihad, the mentors of these and the mullahs are the same people who called Pakistan, Paleedistan and what not from time to time.
They are not letting any stone unturned in the destruction of Pakistan.
They do not deserve to be called humans let alone muslims.
Without rooting these miscreants out of Pakistan, the national security will be at risk.
Is there still room for consideration whether these scoundrels should be banned?
There is no place in this world for extremist mullahs whose only purpose is to kill.
This news tore my heart.
What kind of world is that in which it has become difficult for those who even take the name of one of the important parts of the religion of Allah, Islam.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims, but if a Muslim even tries to extract revenge, along with the whole non-Muslim world, even the hypocrite leaders join and treat those who have sincere religious feeling in the manner our great leaders are treating Hafiz Saeed.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-
Pak relationships turned sour, because of which the proximity between the two countries forming after many years, for the first time suffered a severe setback.
India has always claimed that militant and non-militant groups which are active in Pakistan were responsible.
For the relationships to return to normal, taking action against these countries is being made a prerequisite,
Whereas Indian security agencies have accused Lashkar-e-Taiba of being directly responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
The name of Jama'athud Da'wah also comes up many times in this regards.
This is not the first time that relationships between the two countries have become serious due to some terrorist activity that took place in India.
In December 2001, after the attack on the parliament, the two neighbors were prepared to go to war.
After that, Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned and it was included in the list of terrorist groups.
Now, it is being demanded that Jama'athud Da'wah, which according to security reports is just a new form of Lashkar-e-Taiba, also be banned.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against the active fundamentalist groups within its boundaries or not?
Can putting a ban on Jama'athud Da'wah help the present Indo-
Pak crisis to subside, and how important is it for permanent peace between the two countries that armed groups be dismantled?
The Security Council of the United Nations has passed the ban on Jama'athud Da'wah. However, what proof did the Security Council have based on which it showed such urgency.
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful state.
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salam- Please do it with pleasure but act at your own.
do not do it under American pressure.
if India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
And why it accuses us of every thing?
there are extremist groups and organizations in India as well, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the world?
What India is doing in Kashmir, what is that?
What Israel is doing, what is that?
the truth is; we are the first Nuclear Muslim State and why; this is the main issue.
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart and circumstances also seems to be such
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be the part of this conspiracy.
American are not slowly but now very swiftly tightening there grip over Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances,if we as a nation does not display unity and solidarity then if Bangladesh can be created,anything else can also happen.
More the terrorism is condemned lessor it is , whether it is in a Hotel at Mumbai or it is in Marriott Hotel Islamabad or it is in Palestine.
Like wise irrespective of the origin of the terrorist, these should be eliminated, no matter these are Pakistanis or Indian or American or Israelite.
Now the question is that why the whole world including the Pakistani officials are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack carried out on Marriott Hotel was not a terrorist attack?
then why-
hale to the advisor for interior Rehman Malik, how brave and bold has the gentleman become.
no imgage
not only this, but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under 'someones's pressure'.
wow, all praise to the Almighty!
whether having the ability or not or to say that I don't want.
We, the Pakistanis are fighting whose war.
and why we have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect.
No one has  a right to interfere anyone's national affairs.
The colonial system is apparently not there.
If people expect justice, or demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan, which I think is not acceptable by those calling for unity.
As such, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
And this causes more opposing feelings.
If they trust America and the United republics, then let them leave the style of new populations, and let them work on those lines, upholding the sovereignty of the state.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
In Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, security forces captured a proved camp of practically non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India's accusation is that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Minister, Condoleeza Rice told the Pakistani leadership that there should be immediate action taken against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack.
It is their claim that without a doubt, the extremists who carried out the Mumbai attacks used Pakistani land.
In the meanwhile, officials in Peshawar claim that the lot of trucks which carry supplies to the united forces in Afghanistan was burnt by unidentified armed people, because of which more than 50 trucks were destroyed.
This is the second attack in Peshawar on NATO and American supplies in the last 48 hours.
In the meanwhile, Pakistan captured an established camp of the almost inexistent Lashkar-e-Taiba. Previously, lots of efforts were carried out to try to disarm armed groups all the way from Karachi to the tribal regions, which included giving compensation to those who returned their weapons and even ascertaining them that no action would be taken against them.
The situation is telling us that the efforts undertaken in the regime of General Ziyaul Haqq, after the previous Soviet Union's interference in Afghanistan to get rid of the armed groups that formed as a result of the resistance that started through American and Saudi funding, and to bring an environment similar to that before 1980 were not successful.
The question is what does Pakistan want to do?
Does Pakistan have the ability to do so?
What do you say?

I have only one question for the standard bearers of the world.
If you kill their children, will they come to garland you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill innocent public, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in negative, then you really need to fix your viewpoint.
The people were armed when there was the fear that Russia would head towards Pakistan after finishing Afghanistan, and that is why they were supplied arms.
Now, when there is the fear that America will capture Pakistan, via Afghanistan, as the president American president has clearly mentioned in his presidential mission, why should we disarm them now?
Only so that after defeating the American or Indian army, it does not have to face any resistance from the public?
Yes, if any of them are guilty of being involved in any destructive work, Pakistan can take action against them alone.
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
And another question is that were these terrorists not supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the present terrorism is in no way connected to it.
It must be remembered that Hafiz Saeed is the first 'Jehadi leader' who called the Taliban actions 'mischief'.
I am sure that the Taliban effect is a inseparable result of American plans, and hence every person who can stand in the way of Taliban must be removed.
Despite the support of the whole nation, the fact that Zardari and co. took action against the Lashkar is a clear sign of their frigid and kiss-up nature.
To stop the project that is running on Saudi-American funding, they must be requested themselves to regather, for God's sake, the filth that has polluted our society.
And also protest against them asking them based on what ethics, America and Saudi spread dangerous weapons and so called Jihadi, but in reality hate inciting and cultural virus enticing literature in our country, because of which our country has become a human slaughterhouse.
After the threat of an attack from the Indian side, an announcement from the Pakistan Army that they would pull their troops from the Afghan Border and would commit them towards India and a declaration from Taliban that they would take care of the Afghan Border, staggered the Americans badly and thus put all their weight behind Pakistan against an Indian attack.
This exposed the might of the American Army in the region.
Although India neither made any threat of an attack nor she had the courage to do so.
In addition, attacks of Taliban on the American supply lines proved to be the final nail in the coffin.
Thus, it was proved that without the help of Pakistan Government and Army, America would achieve nothing.
Karachi is the trade and financial center of Pakistan, and the Dubai of the backward regions.
Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty handed, but ever since the law and order situation in the western border regions was lost, all people diverted their attention here.
Now they waant to kidnap this city.
For the first time, Pathans began to be called Pukhtons, and the people of a single town are made foreigners and are being made to fight, while the need is for unity.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speaking learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu, or its better that everybody learns English.
You must be thinking its a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
that the cause of the torture would be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir in my childhood I had actually given the same suggestion many times to my friends ,which included people from every religion and rhetoric groups, but my friend people used to laugh over these suggestions.
at that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not that live and powerful but they were boiling inside.
its hard to understand that what is happening and why?
are these the signs of the judgement day?
what are these innocent and innoxious people being killed for?
the reason is in front of everyone, ones who want to break Pakistan into pieces are active and those who do all this neither belong to any religion nor a country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns
Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir mean that which is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
At the height of the Mumbai attacks, the fact that the efforts to cause mischief on linguistic and racial lines in Karachi failed is proof that those politicians working on racial parole have resigned from their jobs.
The taking of the lives of innocent Pushtu speaking labourers and the Indian warnings have awakened the sleeping Pakistani feelings from Karachi to Khyber.
The identical country loving reaction of all the political, religious, linguistic and national parties has not only taught India the manners of diplomacy but it has also given the American policy makers a chance to think again.
The responsible parties for the worsening situation in Karachi are the United and the ANP, and the government is taking sides.
The government can control the situation in one hour, but it is purposely allowing it to grow.
The police and rangers are avoiding action because of the pressure on them by the political parties.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
until there is pressure on the administration, these kind of incidents will keep taking place.
I think these people are the biggest terrorists.
and foreign powers are definitely involved in this but no one knows who they are?
but alas that if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there, but since its not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
the government should operate here and save a large and very important city of the country from terrorism
otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
BBC Urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure and Pakistani media's condition is already weak.
the whole truth is there on BBC English.
one solution to the problem is that either Urdu speakers should learn Pushto or Pushto speaking learn Urdu or better if every body learns English.
you will definitely take is as a funny suggestion but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
that the cause of extremism be language?
They spilled blood in Karachi and the story that each citizen was fearing for a long time was finally written.
No one left any stone unturned, and the reports that surfaced in the media was 50% of what actually happened here in four days.
I stayed up the last three nights and I am still afraid.
The people who killed the cobblers and peanut sellers who evacuated the hotel
The people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of Allah's punishment which can catch them anytime.
What do you think are the reasons for this sudden violence?
(BBC)
Keeping the heart rendering Mumbai attacks in view and diving to search for a cause for the violence in Karachi is not at all needed, rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in 'blood'.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control.
the blood of the loyalists of Liaqat Ali Khan also belonged to the same place but to eliminate Mr. Psycho's misunderstanding I am writing this verse.
we will also repeat our elders' traditions
we made it by sacrificing lives and will save it by doing the same
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
it is very disappointing that whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
see Liaqat Ali Khan, you will will find out that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family from Karnal in Punjab.
due to his steps for the migrants, today the migrants consider him as one of them.
there is always a reaction to every action.
one can afford on oneself but.
I'jaz A'wan
Sir, before you get a large number of people with proposals, I shall tell you that the open signs of this mischief is also found on the walls of Karachi, in the form of posters and wall chalking.
We have been bearing both types of mischief.
Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan. They did not have to face any reaction.
Contrary to that, they are pecking at the chest of Pakistan.
There used to be one Muslim League (n), but they also made the rough version of the 18th amendment and handed it over to the Peoples Party.
Before that, MQM and Muslim League (q) had already handed in rough versions of the 18th amendment to the national assembly and senate.
It still seems that the copies of the 18th amendment is a political trickery, and no one is sincere about accepting that amendment.
This is why no fuss was made in the assembly or on the floor of senate over this amendment, and the parliament was not forced into accepting the amendment.
It looks as if the parties just wanted to get the thing off their backs by submitting the rough versions, so that tomorrow, they may say that we had submitted our versions of the amendment, but the government speaker did not take action.
MQM coalition partner of government, Muslim League N an underhand ally of government and Muslim league Q the party to approve the seventeenth amendment then how is it possible that these parties can be sincere to approve the disapprove amendment.
its just like writing your name amongst shaheeds by just putting color on yourself.
Peoples Party anyway is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment.
How would one think of getting his own hands cut.
as long as Zardari is the president, seventeenth amendment is not going to be cancelled.
this is an opinion of a majority in our survey and so is the truth.
if the seventeenth amendment was to be cancelled then Zardari would never had become the president.
Now he is even more powerful that president Musharaf as along with being the president he is also the chairman of the Peoples party.
as long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.
in order to cancel the seventeenth amendment, the political parties will first have to dismiss president Zardari from the presidency.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
Most of the elders in our family belong to labor class.
During your childhood when we our uncles doing their work we prayed Allah to protect us from physical labor.
To avoid this we wrote to the editor of monthly Amroz to ask him what to do after matriculation so that we would not have to do physical labor.
Editor in reply wrote that we should become Doctor or Engineer and study these courses.
We were inclined towards engineering and in matriculation we studied Technical drawing instead of Biology.
But at the time of admissions in FSc the elder brother forced us to study medical in FSc.
We hardly studied biology for a month before we started studying maths.
Means that to avoid physical labour we became engineer and we are in better position than many friends in our family and we thank Allah for it.
We remembered this when with out 2 young sons we were trying to lift carpets of old hour.
It was not even 30 minutes for us working that our younger son said “Dad it feels like I am not born for this job.
We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.
Son started saying that I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work .
Three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home.
What it means is that when a man decides the destination no matter what were the motives behind this no one can stop him from getting it.
But if you don’t even know what you have to do then God be with you.
They say that you should not speak bad about the dead, but what can I do, even after one year of Benazir's death, I can only see faults in her.
For personal interests, Benazir handed over the list of Sikhs who were fighting for independence to India, at the same time crushing the Sikhs independence movement and also allowing India to transfer its complete attention to Pakistan, having taken care of the Punjab movement.
The Russia wars in the regimes of Benazir and Nawaz Sherif have become a part of history, which pushed the country many years back.
Benazir continued to speak ill about Kashmir and the atomic program throughout exile.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
during her rule, Benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make as much money that is why he is known as Mr. Ten percent.
during Benazir's rule his brother got killed but his murderers are still safe from any punishment.
besides being a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
just like Benazir did her politics over her fathers dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came into power twice but she could not punish her the culprits of her father's political murder even she couldn't register a case against them.
it has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
what should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated 16th December as a didactic day and take such measures that this kind of incident don't take place again.
on this day we could send greeting to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again.
the rulers would reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
He would plan on bringing back the people of Bihar who were stuck in Bangladesh and he would send them gifts to keep their spirits up.
We have become so insensitive that if someone dies in our neighborhood, we are not even aware of it.
We do not care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
A huge calamity can pass by, but the next day we are lost in our day-to-day routine of life.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again, like East and West Germany became one.
We can become one again, if we sacrifice a little for each other and leave our selfishness behind us.
But this wish does not look like it will be fulfilled in the near future.
Today, when it was announced in the news that the governor of American state Illinois was caught on corruption charges
and that he would soon be brought to account for removal from Governorship by the state congress, an American white friend of mine, who had deep insight into the situation in Pakistan, he told us, showing off, look this is called democracy.
In America, no gigantic figure is beyond the law.
and there is your country Pakistan whose president has been elected after dropping of corruption charges.
my sense of humor woke and I said that what's wrong if a governor got arrested in America, in Pakistan, once we arrested the Prime Minister overnight and hanged him and the second time we exiled one.
tell me when it happened in America?
Pakistan sent off the lawbreaker with guard of honor from the presidency, tell me when did such thing happened it America?
In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was suspended in such a way that besides the public support he has not be restored so far, did it ever happened in America?
Holder of a fake degree was made the minster for health in Pakistan, did it ever happen in America?
after hearing all this the American went down laughing and then conceded defeat.
in this picture, president Zardari is smiling despite of being surrounded by the Americans from all four sides.
it looks from his smile
He is thinking that America is supporting his government but he is forgetting that a year ago they were with Pervez Musharaf.
This picture has been taken as it was a family gathering
A photo like this was never published in the papers before; one president with three American officials.
It seems the American involvement in Pakistan has increased and more than one official is needed to do the job; or they are not relying on their new puppet the way they relied on the one before him.
This could also have been arranged keeping in mind the stories of President Zardari’s breach of commitments.
If it had been a sensible ruler, at least he would not have been grinning during the photo session and he would have had a subservient and embarrassing look on his face.
If the principle of democracy is applied on this picture then Present Zardari is in minority.
In democracy, majority rules the country and the picture reveals the actual rulers.
The scenic Swat valley is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
The government’s policy so far is to engage in talks besides the use of force.
But the use of force is achieving nothing other than strengthening the Taliban and increase in public sympathies for them.
what needs to be done is that the government, instead of using the power, should eliminate the causes of the issue.
by eliminating the causes Fazlullah and Taliban will automatically finish.
the Sharia bill proposed by ANP will become the solution of the problems of Swat to a great extent.
But besides implementation of the Sharia, the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues.
from the early steps of General Musharaf, it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians, but the lust of power changed all his plans.
all the hopes were from the participation in the "war of terror", he had started considering himself as immortal.
those steps which were expected, all broke-off.
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, he made a deal with the thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army but never know what's happening to the present government.
Either its Bajor or Swat, the army does not control terror but bombs the "Enemy" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy a mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy.
The conditions in the  terrorism struck area Swat in the Frontier Province are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area
On the one side the governments writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side the effect of Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everday in Swat.
On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.
The result is that on the one side the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other hand the Taliban has established their hold.
In between who got grinded, the poor citizens.
It is said that in Swat somebody asked, which type of people are the Taliban's are? The answer was  "very good people because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country".
Then asked how is Army, the answer was that the Army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.
Then it was asked, who are the enemies of religion and country, the answer was "the citizens"
I am astonished, how the Pakistan Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban's.
Could not track down Taliban's illegally operated FM channel which in my opinion is very easy.
But still FM was spreading hatred in full swing.
After girls schools now boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfew is imposed so that tablibans can move around easily.
Tonight 8 trucks entered the suburbs of Mingora during curfew and created bunkers.
The question is that how could they reach there during curfew.
Army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house and salutes Taliban.
For God sake someone tells this Army to protect helpless people of Sawat from Taliban and prove that Pakistan army can overcome any enemy.
He says that most of the blood is spilt in the name of religion, tell me that if religion was not then blood wouldnt have spilt?
Punjabi, Pathan, White and Blank, Mehsood and other tribes, are these the products of religion?
No, sir, no way! Only religion teaches that there is no black and white, there is no Punjabi and no immigrant. If it were not for religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between the white and the black, and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribe-brotherhood hatred.
Actually, only religion trains man's character and restricts him, as he has not come here on his own will, but rather the Creator of all that exists sent him here, and he must live here according to His commands.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France, for two years, I also felt the same way.
I do not know why people only expect us to call.
A resolution about Iraq, passed in a few hours, to send a 'peace' force to Darfur is not at all a problem.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where there is a matter of death, we are still holding meetings about that.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
is it really being waited to diminish.
so that any again no aggrieved could even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights.
when a father is running carrying his beloved sons dead body, even then your hearts don't pinch you with pain?
If not then you don't even deserve to be called human being.
but you are a black mottle over the name of humanity.
so atleast this has been proven that this region has also been a homeland for Jews for centuries.
ideally these two nations should have lived in harmony but since their strings are in Western and Arab hands, so without their will peace can not prevail in this region.
and now even Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
even if the Israeli operation stops temporarily, it will start again any moment after any incident.
BBC's own country has its interests related to America and Israel and this is why while taking cover of enlightened moderation, it has started a series of blogs or Jewism and doing a biased propaganda.
BBC is only completing a formality, and its goal and intent is only to gather well wishes.
I request the moderator to publish this comment of Fidwi, so it be known that at least a little bit of affinity towards truth is still remaining in BBC
Thank You.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How could I not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time, including Derah Gahzi Khan, summer showers are taking place throughout the country.
here is a poem according to the weather, enjoy the weather along with this poem.
These rains are with your presence.
if it rains, its spring
if it stays then its peace
sometimes comes without a reason
at times spread over day and night
sometimes very noisy and sometimes very quiet
These rains are with your presence.
in a memory, at a night
to a buried ash
Sometimes it was such, that the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burnt itself.
Sometimes each drop seems sorrowful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What is it to them, whether the country lasts or not.
Whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them.
For one, our media is also corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government, and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday afternoon something surprising happened.
All the police is running here and there but do not check illegal parking.
Moreover traffic nypd was also not in the mood to look at the illegally parked vehicles
It happened that a plane of U.S. Air Force actually became a ship and landed in Hudson River.
Till today only this much is known that the "terrorist" belonged to the family of birds called goose.
Yesterday, perhaps it was historical cold in New york.
The temperature never goes down this much.
Pain started in my own jaw, after walking outside for half an hour .
Imagine what was the condition of those persons who jumped from the plane into the the river.
The reason for happiness is that all the person were safe.
The reason for concern is that the plane of the company was drowned during the financial crisis.
I went by West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I still do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, in my one hour trip, the way had opened at least a bit, so I was able to get the 56th street exit.
Otherwise, I had not taken the previous two exits, seeing the lines waiting at them.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women
Shaguftah: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I have slaughtered two chickens and how they are slaughtered, Jahanzeb has already mentioned.
Apart from this, there is no other way.
At this farm, one has to get his own meat done,, including removing the skin.
Basim: .Net might take some to repair.
what happened on the forum?
Linko
in order to work with Listen to Blog, see it in Fire Fox.
Duffer: same to you, Eid Greetings to you.
Sir please use Fire Fox.
the snow will vanish.
we unnecessarily kept thinking of these Taliban of Swat as indelicate but who were only unhappy over women's education.
they kept expressing their grief by demolishing a women's school and college somewhere every day.
but just like other ideas, this idea did not also come true, according to this report by CNN, today on the sacred day of Monday this Taliban gang of Swat have blasted a boy's school.
Swat, The Taliban has destroyed a boys school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Amen, then Amen.
Masha Allah, up till now, 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom of fixing marriages before birth among Muslims, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See a picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
just a while before this, the wedding of a dog with a girl took place.
look at that groom.
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
it is the era of computers and its involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life.
many people have many reservation over this increasing involvement of computer, for example, in financial matters.
where use of credit card bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
so now only through your financial matters like through your credit card, you can be located.
and in future when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent, its benefits will increase more and more.
similarly in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, the credit card information is stolen.
similarly computers have become the source of friendship.
Social networking sites, like Orkut, Facebook and Myspace are at first level of acceptance.
But do you not think that the more we are following these social networking sites, the further we are getting from people in real life?
Similar are the match making websites, where your desires are matched with others desires and you are shown a list of the people who match with you.
But can you lead a life with a person who is just like you?
I can not, and that is why the spouse is called the better half,
because he/she will get rid of the faults within me.
Perhaps I received a lesser share of wisdom.
From childhood, I thought of everything as being true if it was told by an elder.
In the same way, I was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world.
I was even ridiculed a lot on this
But only that seemed true which was plausible.
I was always perplexed at the need of telling a lie.
Even suffered in this part of my age because of this
So I tried to keep the lies at a minimum.
I refrained from giving false hopes to others particularly with Allah’s name
And only say God willing when it was my wish that the work was to be done
Besides Allah knows what is there in the hearts.
This is a disgusting problem which rears its head due to the ignorance of the religion.
According to both our religion and the law in Pakistan, infants should remain with their mother.
Their father is responsible for their maintenance allowance and he can meet them.
then when they become mature, they live with whom they wan to live.
You are right that the actual problem are the relatives who misguide.
feudalism has overshadowed our deeds.
Even here is thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in father's property so it is resisted, although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated.
here these restriction regarding making of relations have created many evils in the society.
concept of remarriage of a divorced or a widow is getting rare.
due these unnecessary beliefs and tradition the family system is facing disarray.
in our society, if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarry, then why it is not appreciated?
there is a Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago, now after getting all his children married when he married a widow, his own children have gone against him.
In my opinion, this is religious right, what do you say?
What type of mentality is the 'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place', kind of mentality?
In my opinion the children of this person should think that after having married all the kids, is there anything wrong in his marrying a widow?
This way the widow gets a caretaker and uncle also gets someone who will take care of his home.
Because his children would certainly be busy in their worldly affairs and would not be having time for him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow if their wives refuse to look after them, when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society, which we are facing for the last 40-50 years.
A wife can accept her husband going around having illicit relations, but she cannot stand him having a second wife.
If possible, stop him from doing so, even after you die.
She destroys her husband and her own hereafter, and becomes a cause for spreading filthiness in the society.
Chanting Islam, Islam does not mean anything. In reality, we like only our culture and traditions.
For instance keeping girls  from gaining education and fearing marrying the girl of ones choice.
As for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house, so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax, (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt).
In the Indo Pak subcontinent, Islam was accepted centuries ago, but it could not yet leave its ignorant mentality and has always kept culture and tradition above Islam.
Thinking of a man's second marriage as an innovation, divorce as a clinical rest, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife, is all a part of this mentality.
What's more, in mimicry of the western countries, we have started to consider piety and veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam is easy, but leaving this mentality is very tough.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Amen
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.
Century passed writing such little writing
Know that little is much.

Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes that i found this secret in my life that if leader of any Army is in front line then that Army will never lose.
But here situation is else.
To say that Common people are there to die for us if we die then martyr
if someone from common people dies then murder
May peace and blessing of Almighty be upon you.
I was coming back to my shop after the Isha prayer tonight, a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called.
I thought that probable this man has lost his way or wants to ask something, I stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car.
he asked me if I could speak and understand Arabic, I said no problem, you tell me what's up?
he started telling that he has come from Riyadh and here in Medina someone picked my pocket, kindly help me. I said please go away brother, since such an incident has already taken place with me that I gave this man 12 riyals so that he could reach Riyadh, but he started doing the same after moving a little farther.
I was furious, I cursed him and threatened him of the Police, then he ran away.
this is the situation of Muslims now that even for begging we ride our cars along with our families and make at least 2 to 3 thousand a day.
However there is a clear Hadith (SAAW) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one.
May Allah bless us and make us true Muslims (Amen)

The wife of famous singer Adnan Sami approached a Police Station in Mumbai, accusing him of torture.
The Police Station advised her to approach the court.
Saba Galadari the wife of Adnan Sami gave an application against her husband that Adnan Sami continuously tortures her
and he is also administering in human behavior against her.
Now this thing has gone out of her tolerance, therefore, a case may be registered against Adnan Sami.
Police  station has advised her to approach the court instead of registering  the case, on the plea that the case is not within the valid jurisdiction of police station
Do you think that the accusation on Adnan Sami by his wife is correct?
Can this accusation is an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Inform us about your opinion on the Subject.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
as far as allegations are concerned, anyone can post it on someone else.
nothing comes before prestige.
however may be the relations between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he left his respectful life and went to India to make money and now this fame has caught him badly.
this is a consequence of his own deeds.
Washington...
top American officials say that president Obama will take strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
in the new American policy over Afghanistan, there is more emphasis on war than development.
officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achievement of American goals Since in his government, there is corruption, drugs business has increased and Taliban are regaining their power.
American officials say that people, who are putting more pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more, include vice president Joe Biden and President Obama's representative for Afhanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke.
They stated that the policy change came after President Bush left office, who used to have video conferencing with Hamid Karzai fortnightly and emphasized the American role in the rebuilding of Afghanistan and its civil institutions.
The Obama administration will work with provincial political leaders instead of the central government.
They said that they will ask Hamid Karzai to intensify the campaign against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing new elections this year and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his administration are going to back him up in the presidential race.
Does this statement reflect a shift in American policy towards Afghanistan?
Is Hamid Karzai’s era coming to an end?
What is your say on this?
In a series of three one day matches between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2-1.
Pakistan had defeated Sri Lanka in the first match, but Sri Lanka was victorious in the remaining two matches.
In the third one day match, the national cricket team's performance was very poor. In reply to Sri Lanka's 309 runs, it only managed to hit 75 runs in 23 overs before going all out. As such, it had to face a humiliating loss.
the result of the series proves that the National team has no consistency in its performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
which departments of the game should be addressed more by the authorities?
are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
which department you will hold responsible for the defeat, fielding, batting or bowling?
please provide your feedback.
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish  traditions continue. these feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule, who would call them Muslims?
a Sardar should walk himself over these embers. why the present government do not act against them?
when the judicial justice will come in handy.
the Srilankan cricket team has arrived Karachi to play One Day internationals.
besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
upon reaching the Karachi airport, the Srilankan team was very warmly welcomed.
two one days between Pakistan and Srilanka in Karachi whereas the third one day will be played in Lahore.
both teams have there claims over bowling, batting and fielding.
if the Srilankans are proud of their spinners, the Pakistanis trust their fast bowlers.
Srilankan Captain Mahela Jayvardena has said that not a single player from Pakistan team but the whole team is dangerous.
Murli dharan and Mendis will be the trump cards whereas the Pakistan Captain says that it will be a tough competition.
Shoaib Malik has said that we have played Murli dharan and we'll see Mendis as well. we have prepared a secret game plan and we shall implement that in the ground.
will the Pak-Srilanka Series be really as interesting and exciting as the claims are?

Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.

How is all this is double for these people, when the Kashmiri people have been fighting for independence for the last 60 years?
No, no one asked, and they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism, so they start talking about making up.
First they openly killed the Muslims, now they are in the efforts of setting things right.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating this situation to distract world attention away from Kashmir issue.
But Pakistan has always showed true face of India to the world
Now British government has realized that Indian government is maligning Pakistan for terrorism so that it can occupy Kashmir.
They are unwilling to talk with Pakistan on this matter
British foreign minister David Miliband said that by resolving Kashmir issue will end extremism. Pakistan government will be able to handle the border issues.
It should be noted that American president Obama has already expressed similar views on Kashmir issue.
British foreign minister has said while talking to media in Mumbai and also written an essay that the idea of war on terror is wrong. On the basis of threat to oneself killing others was Bush's policy.
David Miliband has said that Pakistan should show lineancy towards extremist groups.
Due to insistance of major powers to resolve Kashmir issue India is creating unrest in the region to distract world from this issue.
Terrorist attack in Mumbai is also a part of this strategy.
Is India using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialog?
Let us know of your opinion.
Usman Aftab,
I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
Rather it wants to keep it in check, and hence is thinking of taking certain steps. They know that Pakistan is a nuclear state.
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries are only thinking that if they corner Pakistan, they would face some political and geographic problems. They want to help Pakistan, but also want to be successful in their goal.
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn Pakistan.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.
Faheem Siddiqi
Ras al Khaima, This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is in how deep waters.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers movement not played any role?
What do you have to say about this statement of the Prime Minister?
Make us aware about your opinion.
American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference advised newly elected President Barack Obama saying that he had made many mistakes in his presidency, and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
'I did, as a president, whatever I felt was appropriate, according to the situation, and the American law and constitution, giving preference to American interest over my own acceptance'.
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him, and considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this is my last press conference, and I thank the journalists and other friends who are present in the press conference.
Do you think Obama will not repeat the mistakes that Bush made?
Did Bush delay accepting his mistake?
Will Obama be able to follow Bush's advice?
Aware me about your openion.
The step president of America said that he wants to see Usama live or dead.
He said that Usama bin Ladan is in a difficult place and he became unuseful and if he will arrested live or dead but his organisation should be killed.
America has the aim to arrest Usama bin Ladan and he is being searched.
The arrest of Usama is the completion of heart want of Dak Chene.
Aware me about your openion.

The Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has once again accused Pakistan of provoking for a war.
And Pakistan is using terrorism as a state policy.

Indian prime minister said that the November attacks were carried out by Lashkare Taiba.

how do you see this allegation from the Indian prime minister?
Do the internally opposed and separatist movements of India show the disturbed situation n India?

Give us your views.
Zubair Khan, Karachi
This is a sad calamity that Israeli is massacring the Palestinians and the same situation is prevalent in Kashmir, but there is no effect on the Security Council.
All the organisations present in Palestine and Kashmir should keep their war going until they gain independence, and they should form unity among themselves and keep facing any type of harm, and one day or the other their martyrdom will give fruit, God Willing.
The air attacks by Israel on Gaza are continuing, just the same. Until now, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
Important Hamas leader Nazariyan was killed along with hwife and children.
Here the Security Council meeting concluded without any decision.
The meeting saw American opposition to the derogatory resolutions passed against Israel by Libya and other Arab countries.
From the last few days there has been bombing by Israeli planes on the Palestinian civilian population.
The whole world cried out about the Mumbai issue, but the Israeli attacks do not seem a massacre to anyone including America and Britain.
Why are the important Islamic countries quiet?
What do you want to say about this double standard of the world?
Saeed, New York
I think that actually, most of our people are illiterate. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties, the electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has taken a serious position.
On the other side, there was an increase of an average of 18% in gas rates, while the unavailability of petrol in some cities has become a cause of great difficulty for the public.
Among the manufacturing and business circles, there are strong protests and severe reactions going on, to the long power cut and gas crisis.
The producers have given the ultimatum to close the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is perturbed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
The production life cycle has become practically paralyzed.
The government institutions are blaming each other to express their stand.
Are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas not a joke against the nation?
Why is attention not being paid to solve the problems.
Are the wheels of national development not seeming jammed to the government?
What immediate steps can you suggest to gain control over this crisis?
Let us know of your opinions.
Imran Khokar from Madīnah Munawwarah, “I would like to say that rulers are a reflection of society’s morality.
I am surprised that government carrying slogan of public service is itself hurting them.
unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a persecution.
Government has no control over the institutions.
Law and order situation is deteriorating every day, may Allah bestow his mercy on this country.

after ruling America for 8 years, president Bush has departed from the White House and shifted to the president camp office in Camp David so that the White House can be renovated according to the new president Barak Obama's likings.
During Bush's eight years rule, the historical attacks and destruction of the World Trade Center, attack on Pentagon and then in the name of war against terror, attacking Afghanistan and Iraq and involving forces from other countries into the war and use of American resources in it have become memorable examples of his time.
due to this war America itself faced the worst ever economical and financial crisis in history.
what do you think the world achieved and lost through this war?
were the policies of Bush successful?
what is your opinion on president Bush's rule?
the Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, in an interview with Jeev News said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour, but due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step? Should sports not be separated from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision not harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that the security condition in India is bad, the England cricket team is continuing its tour, so why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this?
Salman, Karachi
Those people who are proud about going to India
and they make their films and videos over there, their eyes should open now, as to how much the people of India respect you.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan at the first opportunity, because he did not get honor there either.
Farid Ahmad
Karachi
After the Mumbai attacks, the mode of the Indians have changed.
Jagjeet Singh reacted by expressing that he hates Pakistan and Pakistanis.
It should be known that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsle and how has he become helpless now? Adnan Sami should stay in India. There is no need for him to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Aalam,
Karachi. I will only say so much about Jagjeet Singh, that he too changes colors like a chameleon,
and speaks on the occasion. Pakistanis, open your eyes and see how much you are respected in India. Do not be dull minded.
After the Mumbai incident, their hate filled speech has increased. Now they are spreading poison about famous singer Adnan Sami.
according to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said "You dog this is a farewell kiss"
after that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards Bush. president Bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself.
second shoe hit the American Flag.
Security personnels dragged the journalist away from there.
at this point, president Bush said that he didn't know why he had done so , Shoe was of number 10, I had no problem.
do you think this reaction of the journalist wasn't an expression of deprecation or President bush from the Iraqi people?
what would you say on this incident?
The tension between Pakistan and India's relations after the terrorism in Mumbai got further intense when the fighter planes from the Indian Air force violated the Pakistani airspace in Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
as a result of retaliation from Pak Air force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
sources say that both Indian planes were loaded with ammunition.
In the current tensed situation it is the first incident of its own kind.
Pakistan Air Force says that Air Force is fully vigilant to defend the country.
Minister of Information Sherry Rehman says India has admitted that it was a violation of air space limit, however it was a mistake.
Pakistan Army resources declared this incident as crucial.
Do you think India really intends to launch an air attack on Pakistan?
Is India's claim is correct that this violation was a mistake or it was objected to measure the capability of Pakistan Air Force.
Not this incident will increase tension between the two countries?

Samir

It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she changed totally.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party, and made her son the representative of Peoples Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi, This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
But until the iron ax is not fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are just like this, that they are adopting secretive ways. This is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations have included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed as well as two other Pakistani citizens and that of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organisations into the list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaidah and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, practically non-existent organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba Operation Chief, Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organisations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organisations, they will be restricted from traveling and will be under arrest.
They will have to face cases.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India blaming these parties for the Bombay attacks without any proof?
Aren't there any terrorist groups in India?
Are International groups not aware of the tortures being done on the minorities in India?

Karachi, our leaders should understand this that people, they are doing the operation against, are the true valuers of Pakistan, who are tolerating all kinds of tortures but they love Pakistan.
If there would be war then they will fight for Pakistan.
When their love would be felt, just condenming politics will not work. I think between both, there might be going a resulting war.
