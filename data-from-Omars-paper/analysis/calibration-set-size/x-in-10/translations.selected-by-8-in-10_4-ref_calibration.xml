   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reid who has worked in the Lever national laboratory of America as a Weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the Ex director of technical intelligence at Las Elmos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.</seg>
    <seg id="3">this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">in an interview with US news, Thomas Reid said that in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's rule, China experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reid said that based to many reasons, he has a belief that China had experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">the reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">he further added that this was the reason that in 1998 only in a span of two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments as a reply to Indian nuclear experiments.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that in May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with a lot of care and Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reed was asked this question that China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan so he said in his answer that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that its evidence is also present that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan has used the Chinese model. Later the documents received from Libya also confirm this.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Another question that is it common to do nuclear experiments mutually. Then he said that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that we also predict that Israel also has access to the results of this experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reeds was also asked if China is continuing nuclear proliferation?</seg>
    <seg id="15">On this Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and the design to a nuclear facility of Iran in its city Asfahan.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He said that China had been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Rome, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen via North Korea.</seg>

    <seg id="2">Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany left a huge business group behind him.</seg>
    <seg id="3">but a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.</seg>
    <seg id="4">when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.</seg>
    <seg id="5">The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 to one Billion Euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle went into deep pressure.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had got to this position from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic powet.</seg>
    <seg id="8">After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quick, putting it on new lines.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm, Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm always had special importance.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.</seg>
    <seg id="14">After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have sanctioned 400 million Euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.</seg>

    <seg id="6">experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.</seg>
    <seg id="7">According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Pattricia P. Leka of Maya clinic Minnesota says that increase in age is a big reason for being handicapped from exercise and less physical activity.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She headed a research regarding heart diseases and man's ability to do exercise in older age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart.</seg>
    <seg id="12">In which heart's activity of pumping blood and its contraction and relaxation was studied.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They came to know that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says with increase in age, problems occur in the activity of relaxation of heart and with increase in age, this effects the ability to exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that we were surprised to see that it has an effect  and it confirmed that bad exercising ability is very much related to the heart relaxing activity.</seg>
    <seg id="18">some times blood pressure can cause disorders in heart's functions and heart diseases.</seg>
    <seg id="19">if the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard, then they can take advantage of the benefits of exercise even with the age.</seg>

     <seg id="2">And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="3">To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.</seg>
     <seg id="5">From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.</seg>
     <seg id="6">But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.</seg>
     <seg id="7">We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.</seg>
     <seg id="8">It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God</seg>
     <seg id="9">This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.</seg>
     <seg id="10">It was not even 30 minutes for us working that our younger son said “Dad it feels like I am not born for this job.</seg>
     <seg id="11">We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="12">Son started saying that I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work .</seg>
     <seg id="13">Three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home.</seg>
