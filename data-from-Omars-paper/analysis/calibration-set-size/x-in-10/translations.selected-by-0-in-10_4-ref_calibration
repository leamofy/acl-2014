Protest against the siding of Journalists.
I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway in to the hall of thermonuclear destruction. I believed that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality.
I believe that even amid today's mortar bursts and whining bullets, there is still hop for a brighter tomorrow. I believe that wounded justice, lying prostrate on the blood flowing streets of our nation can be lifted from this dust of shame or reign supreme among the children of men.
I have the audacity to believe the people everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits.
This faith can give us courage to face the uncertainties of the future. It will gives our tired feet new strength as we continue our forward stride toward the city of freedom.
When our days become dreary with low-hovering clouds and our nights and become darker than a thousands midnights, we will know that we are living in the creative turmoil of a genuine civilization.

I was also asked how I could subsist on the little food I ate during my meals,and this knowledge again was obtained by watching me eat till i mustered enough courage to shut the kitchen door.
The villages were curious about me, and strange as it may seem, I had not anticipated it. It usually showed itself in their asking me direct question.

The role of the European Union in peace making in the Middle East.
If looked at from a government perspective, of the diplomatic efforts going on to stop the Middle East war, those of the European Union are the most decisive.
According to the state policy of Brussels, the efforts of the Shwarzenburg delegation or those of Sarkozy, is similar to giving a helping hand.
The spokesperson of the European Commission, Amadeu Altafaj, said that every effort which helps advancing the joint message of the European Union to the two parties, is welcome.
As far as the state policy is concerned, everyone seems alright.
However, in reality, the European Union is in a sad state of internal differences from the inside.
As the president of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is weak, to start with.
On top of that, internal fighting has made it all the more helpless.
On the other hand, French President, Sarkozy's demeanor is such that one would think that he was the president of the Union.
Though France has completed it's 6 month presidency period.
Sarkozy wants to play a presidential role, and he is able to, but he does not have the permission to do so.
The most ridiculous situation faces the foreign minister of France, Bernard Kouchner.
He is part of the delegation, which is being headed by Schwarzenberg, the foreign minister of Czech Republic.
What is even worse is that both the foreign ministers are giving different statements on the middle east war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself whereas according to Kouchner this war does not come under defense policy. On the other side, Germany has also sent its special ambassador to Middle East. European Union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues.
Its evidence is the reaction of Israel who does not pay an importance to the conciliation efforts of the EU.
EU has a golden chance of getting something done. Because America has lost in the Middle East due to the policies of George Bush.
Economic setback: Suicide of German billionaire industrialist.
Adolf Meerklay, residing in the area of Sawabia in southern Germany, has though left a great business group behind him.
But earlier common German citizens did not know much about him.
Later when he had to conference, about the loan given to his industrial group, with almost 30 banks for many weeks, he also became topic of the headlines. And he could see a dark future of Meerklay groups.
The Merkel Group had to suffer financial losses of many millions of Euro after its investment to buy shares of German auto maker Volkswagen.
Then monetary institutions canceled this groups loan amounting 700 million and another 1 billion Euro that it necessarily required and hence Merkel came into extreme pressure.
Some time back the bank agreed to provide Merkel Group an emergency loan but Adolf Merkel who raised from a small industrialist to the position of a strong industrial group whose annual income was approximately 30 billion Euro, could not bare the loss in his investment capability.
Adolf Merkel, after the death of his parents started managing the business and took to modernize it.The business under his supervision became very popular and became more strong.
He named his company Ratiopharm which is today Germany's very large acclaimed and successful pharmaceutical company.
Some time back the commercial value of this company was in between 5 and 6 billion Euro and still was earning a revenue of 8.1 billion Euro annually. After the great success of Ratiopharm, the Merkel Group acquired many big businesses which included building materials maker Hydelberg cement to modified/special car maker Kassbohrer company.
The workforce of Merkel Group is nearly about 100,000 throughout the world and its assets include Ratiopharm which always was the most important business in the portfolio.
Adolf Merkel during his liftime expressed the view may a time that " It has been four generations that we have been in pharmaceutical business.
Now the management of this institution is with my children and I hope this institution will be for few hundred years be managed by and in possession of my family.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, the banks have provided approval for temporary loans of 400 million Euro for VEM Group but added the condition that VEM should sell off Ratiopharm to improve the financial situation for a long term sustainability.
Like this, after the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain the same as it was.
Crime rate among the immigrants in Germany.
According to the fresh statistics, crime rate among the immigrants from 2004 to 2007 is
Reduced from 9.22%
to 4.21%
According to Joachim Herrmann, the interior minister of Baweria province, this is apparently a positive change.
He said: "It is important to note that the number of foreigners getting German citizenship is increasing.
Therefore this should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German but his background is foreign.
Herrmann said that his province will take this in to account when gathering statistics in 2010.
Besides Baweria, Hamburg is also thinking in the same lines.
The internal affairs senator related with the matters of CDU, Cristoph said: "When research is done in a scientific manner, Ahlhaus, man can not bring about its required results as it wills, but rather, it depends on the numbers and statistics that come out from the research.
He referred to a crime prevention state wise objective report, Ahlhaus, which was prepared in 2006, and on the face of which he researched this. It was reported as to what percent of the people committing crime from Bergdorf to Hamburg were foreigners.
From the results, it became clear that the foreigners there
had a lower crime percentage than the crimes taking place in the whole state.
Contrary to this, during 2006, when the percentage of youngsters committing crimes was calculated, it became evident that the youngsters from a foreign background committing crime was 44
.7 percent.
However, the various German political parties such as SPD, environmentalist party, grains, and left wing party Linkspartei is against finding out during the collecting of crime statistics, as to which German citizen is of foreign background.

The history of civilization shows how man always has to choose between making the right and the wrong use of the discoveries of science. This has never been more true than in our own age.
In a brief period amazing discoveries have been made and applied to practical purposes. It has become platitude to say we are living in an age of revolution. it would be ungrateful not to recognize how immense are the boons which science has given to mankind. It has brought within reach of multitudes benefits and advantages which only a short time ago were the privilege of the few.it has shown how malnutrition, hunger and disease can be overcome.
It has not only lengthened life but it has deepened its quality. Fields of knowledge, experience and recreation often in the past only to a few have been thrown open to millions.
But the gifts of modern science can be misused.
Through the work of science ordinary man today has been given the opportunity of a longer and fuller life than was ever possible to his grandparents. Most thankfully we must acknowledge all that science has done and is doing for the welfare of our race. but the gifts of modern science can be misused.
The motor-driven vehicle facilitates business and gives harmless enjoyment to many; but it can strew the roads with dead and dying-over more causalities in one year in this country alone.
The cinema is a means of instruction and recreation opening magic casements, but it is often any channel of vulgarity and false values.
The wireless can link the world together in a moment of time, but it can also be the instrument of lying propaganda. The aeroplane makes travel rapid and easily.
It can also become a weapon of destruction. It is this two-fold aspect of the use to which science can be put that has raised in an acute form the question.
It is morally justifiable to make any perfect discoveries an inventions which can be used for purpose of destruction.

Tea: an effective cure for breast cancer
According to a new research, three cups of tea a day,
if taken, can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age, by more than a third.
In a research carried out by the Moffitt Cancer Institute, in the American state of Florida, it was revealed that the risk of occurrence of breast cancer tumors, in such women below the age of 50 years
who drink at least three cups of tea a day, is reduced by up to 37%.
It was also revealed in the research that there was no significant benefit, in these regards, in the woman aged above 50, who drank three or more cups of tea a day.
Experts believe that the reason for this is that tea has such ingredients in it, which are more effective against specific tumors which generally occur in women below the age of 50.
in the Moft Cancer Center situated in Tampa city of the State of Florida, a research was carried out on 5 thousand women who had taken the treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 70 years.
the experts compared their medical record and life pattern with that of women who were safe from breast cancer.
the experts also found out that on a particular type of cancer, Lobular, tea had shown a great effect and it reduced by 66 percent.
almost every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type of it.
this type of cancer is more dangerous because it deep inside and is usually diagnosed when it has already spread to a great extent.
Experts say that by taking at least three cups a day regularly, the danger of breast cancer can be reduced in young women.
they say that making tea a regular drink in daily life can cause great resistance in the body against breast cancer.
in Britain, every year, almost 40 thousand women are diagnosed to have breast cancer.

Why the reduction of exercise with increasing age?
New research
Exercise is good at every age to remain healthy.
It makes your heart stronger, reduced Cholesterol levels, helps control weight, helps in limiting Diabetes and slows the Alzheimer's process.
Unfortunately, with many people with increasing age reduces the ability to exercise.
Experts says with exercise our body and brain remains alert yet aging can affect it.
According to American Medical Association if exercise is excluded from daily life there can be many health problems that can develop in the future.
Dr. Pattricia P. Leka of Maya clinic Minnesota says that increase in age is a big reason for being handicapped from exercise and less physical activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo clinic.
She headed a research regarding heart diseases and man's ability to do exercise in older age.
Team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart.
In which heart's activity of pumping blood and its contraction and relaxation was studied.
Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.
They came to know that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.
Dr. Patricia says with increase in age, problems occur in the activity of relaxation of heart and with increase in age, this effects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research
He says that we were surprised to see that it has an effect  and it confirmed that bad exercising ability is very much related to the heart relaxing activity.
some times blood pressure can cause disorders in heart's functions and heart diseases.
if the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard, then they can take advantage of the benefits of exercise even with the age.
a detailed report in this matter is published in a magazine of American Medical Association.
No chances of an immediate war with Pakistan: Indian Army chief
Indian Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan how ever we are always ready to defend our country and sacrifice our lives for it.
He has accused that despite of commitments and international pressure on Pakistan as a result of Mumbai attacks, the infrastructure of terrorism is not only existent but also proactive in Pakistan.
he said this while talking to the correspondents in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day tour to the valley of Kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in New Delhi administered Kashmir and preparation of armed forces on the borders.
He was asked a question, that according to the media reports Pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from India regarding the Mumbai attacks, what were his thoughts about it.
General Kapoor said that the decisions of peace or war matters are taken by the political leadership.
Mentioning the proven presence of a terrorism structure in Pakistan, he said that the Indian army would face such groups which are trying to disturb peace and are bent upon weakening India.
He said that in Indian Kashmir, at least 700 to 800 militants are present, of which approximately half are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that with an improvement in the seasonal weather, there might be an increase in infiltration from Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. However, India has increased the guard at the borders.
He refuted the possibility of decrease in the army posting in Kashmir, saying that there can be no compromise with regards to national security.
May Allah bless the tongues of the world and may Barack become a blessing for the world.
Though it was not expected, still we shall see how this change  will work out in our favor with regards to Pak-American relations.
And what Barack Obama, who is the result of Martin Luther Kings dreams, gives to the world.
Obama, part of whose name is Husain, taking the oath today, as the American President, is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance, but also a historic test.
Not only for himself, but also for all the people who supported him.
It will even be a test for the white majority, as for them to accept from their hearts, a black governing over them is no easy task.
Here in South Asia, specially the Muslims which have some expectations from Obama, should remember that Obama has been elected the president of America. Obama also should remember that practically America is the president of whole world.
After a while, a person whose ancestors were slaves and bought from different regions of the world, is going to become the 44th president of America.
People have some many expectations from this man.
Obama's fans should not expect something unrealistic from him.
if Obama becomes successful in decreasing the religious and racial acrimony, it will be a victory for his fans.
How south Asia will be affected by this change and can it be expected any meaningful change in American policies.
How Pakistan and America's relationship will be affected by this change.

Dear, Presence of Obama or others does not matter because the strong Jewish lobby is the real authority which decides the policy and types of relations with other world.
As Pakistan is concerned, The world saw how aggressive behavior was shown by the triangle; America, India and Israel after Mumbai Attacks.
Even for a while, after Pakistan was formed, the managing of Swat was left to the Ruler of Swat, which had it's own army and law.
They surrendered their rule to the government of Pakistan according to a treaty.
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a step mother.
There has been no increase in the number of schools in Swat, since the rule of the Ruler of Swat was finished.
Nor was there any interest in the construction and development over there.
The number of girls receiving education in the present rule is many times less than their number in the previous rule.
In the Sarhad state of Pakistan, the local Taliban have been targeting the educational institutions.
The most schools were destroyed in Swat province, of which the majority were girls schools.
Not only this, but the Taliban have announced the prohibition of girls education in Swat.
Thousands of boy and girl students are being deprived of education.
What do you think the Taliban have to gain by eradicating female education?
Why has the government been unsuccessful in stopping these illegal steps?
What do you think the government should do?
The question should be, what does the ISI and Pakistani agencies get?
Because the public of Swat have realized this was a game, and that the army was there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them. Otherwise, how could five schools be blown up in a single curfew night? How could people be slaughtered during curfew and hung in the main circle of the town?
When the government is not being allowed to have any say in Swat, how can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps?
Now, the question arises, as to when the government has an armed military, new and dangerous weapons, new technology and spy system etc., then why are these four Taliban not being controlled?
The answer to this is that they have the hand of a hidden guide on their heads, because of which neither do their weapons get exhausted, nor do they get captured.
The conclusion is that the Taliban, through there dark activities is making the work of the global leadership easier.
15 years ago, the war was on in Afghanistan.
The ISI was controlling the Taliban while on the opposing side was the northern coalition that was being aided by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly the scenario changed and the activities of the Taliban came into light.
And the ISI also was offered financial aid by the Americans which resulted in past friends becoming foes.
Now the scenario is that the war is still raging but the supporters in Pakistan are still the same, Iran, India and Russia.
Until mankind can understand the difference between whats right and whats wrong he will always make the wrong decision.
For example if a thief goes to perform a crime but just before he commits it he realizes that its a wrong thing to do and that robbing is a sin and that it is punishable so if he fears his Lord he will then not commit the crime.
Now in the same way until and unless Israel understands that it is doing the wrong thing by shedding the blood of innocent people in Gaza and that it'll be punished for as long as it continues to kill innocent people there.
Greetings!
The question is that is war, aggression, the answer to the Terrorist issue?
If not then what is that unique formula that can move us toward solving this issue?
This is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but rather it puts 'blessings' in them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development, that Nelson Mandela had used in South Africa.
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
From the Kashmiris taking part in the elections, it looks as if they have accepted this view point.
It is the third week of Israeli attacks on Gaza and the number of deaths have gone close to a thousand.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date, a ceasefire was not possible.
According to another report, since the start of attacks, on the 27th of December, 90,000 Palestinians have left their homes and moved towards safer locations.
Here, aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, and said that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victim of grave psychological and emotional difficulties.
What do you say?
What should happen?
How is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Give Taliban a Chance.
Basit, Peshawar
Wake up! If Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down girls schools?
And kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
These Taliban has damaged Islam so much that no other nation or religion has done.
Pushtun force
Kohat, Pakistan
If the entire Muslim world gets together and even just warns Israel of attacking it, you will see how much Israel's daddy, America will get hurt.
And not only will their be immediate talks of ceasefire, there will also be an actual ceasefire.
But what can be done, where can our leaders get so much courage from?
Someone should tell Ahmedinejad that he should take the lead, as BBC forum's are full of discussion of your braveness.
The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights falls not only upon the Arabs, or the Muslims of the world, but rather it is the duty of all the nations in the world that they speak up against oppression.
This troubling incident is one of the worst misdeeds of Bush yet.
Similar to how, in Pakistan and India, on the 30th of June, that is before the close of the financial year, the government institutions are looted, in the same way, before the winding up of the American government, Israel was given the green signal to do whatever it wants.
On one hand, America says that it will try for a ceasefire.
On the other hand United Nations is passing resolution after resolution but practically both had been futile. This only concludes one idea that  to oppress Muslims the United Nations is also a party to the Muslim oppression.
All Muslim countries should immediately revoke their United Nations membership and lay foundation for a united Muslim Union.
There are many evident examples in front of us,in which America and the United Nations only promises and passes resolutions. It is the Muslims in the end who suffer.
What is the use of such propaganda when BBC does not published the matter?
Now where are all the ideals of journalism buried? When unjustified spillage of blood especially Muslim blood occurs BBC takes a neutral position of not being a side to any party.
by the way is a flag bearer of rights
to raise voice is a far reality, the limit of hypocrisy is that it doesn't even publish the views
from the Muslim side
The only difference in you and the Jews is the latter call themselves Jews, they martyr Muslims and living amongst Muslims like you they call themselves Muslims
syja786
For a while, BBC forums have been making a certain point, sometimes while discussing suicide attacks and other times, terrorism in India.
The most used word in these anti-Islamic comments is extremism.
But, who is extremist, that you can easily figure out from the above comment.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal can not be fought with the sword?
Looking at the helpless people facing the Israel bombings, if the heart does not cry tears of blood what coes it do?
But the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that we try to use the name of Jihad to disfigure the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existece of Israel, then what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks.
The conduct of both sides is misanthropist.
The action of the United Nations and the United States seem to be supporting the Israeli wrongdoings.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
And we should think about giving the real terrorists an anti-terrorism Nobel prize for their painstaking efforts against terrorism, as after all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, would it be possible for terrorism to take place at such a large scale without the support of some big leader? And everyone knows who is controlling the strings.
In easy words, such gangsters are told to do whatever they want.
What a forceful act, hit on the head, and do not allow to cry.
The medicines for the injured, the shroud and compensation for  the dead are being given by the Arab rulers, and the question is,
Israeli attacks, what should happen?
The actual problem is that the leaders of all the Muslim countries, including the Saudi king are in a deep sleep. They neither have an army nor any protective plans. They think they can support and fulfill their responsibility.
They should take immediate action against Israel.
such as stopping the sale of petrol to Europe and America, but unfortunately..
Salams to all sisters and brothers.
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is similar to considering them defeated.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature, as the steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Israel and Hamas should enter a truce so that the death and destruction can come to an end.
Mohammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France
Absolutely correctly stated
Supposing that Hamas is 100% on the truth, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah. Even then, they should know that if a good deed is resulting in the destruction of an established house, it is no more a good deed.
Those who claim to love God, love the messenger and love their religion, loving mankind is a part of their faith.
As if it is the order of Allah to evacuate all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than the Muslims.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
No, not to kill them, but rather the order is to invite them to Islam.
But those people who plan against the religion, there is the order to perform Jihad against them.
To fight them until they stop their plans, but this does definitely not mean that you wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the end result of killing innocent children is destruction.
But I would like to tell my friends that yesterday the Israelis did not have any place for shelter, but today they have become so strong that they do not listen to anyone. This is because the Jews are one.
They do not have Shia, Sunni. They are all just Jews, and they have made everything for development.
On the other hand, what is the state of the 55 Islamic countries?
They are behind in every field, and now the situation is that they have become so helpless that the enemy is killing them and they are waiting to die.
The need is for all the Muslim countries to get togetherand prepare an action plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better course of action than accepting Israel. Learn new technology and ways of success from them and let the world live in peace.
Muslims have great land and resources.
The need is correct usage.
First of all, the most tragic part is that Hammas and Alfatah could not be united.
The only reason to destroy great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin was to weaken the only nation fighting for Aqsa Mosque. And it was impossible until Yasir and Yasin were removed from the way.
The world is watching that how Palestine was falling down every second after the death of these two leaders.
And  how this lobby of jews strengthened their target by every moment.
In 1974, a Pakistani Prime minister was in such world power that he led all the muslim leaders under one roof with 100% attendance first time in the history.
Today, on his 81st birthday, is it hard for this nation to make a promise that whether it will unite itself or not.
more over by resolving Muslims conflicts (Islamic common wealth establishment) will give plunge to its uncompleted mission.
this is that jinn which lap to Palestinian since more than half century
this jinn have many face.
many time this jinn on his some other face give a bad remarks for his own self to turn back worlds pressure and concentration.
and this jinn other face eating peoples in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
and this jinn have a big fear of Islam, as this jinn knows that when ever he pull out this only and only by Islam Muslims and Muslims complete religion and act of Islam pull out because history said that Islam put on right track many biggest Abujahal.
Israels fighter jets start bombarding on Gaza and lunched missile attacks from 27th of December.
in this attack more than three hundred resident died.
after air attack now Israeli tanks and bulletproof vehicles prepare completely to war through land and reached on Gaza boundary.
United Nations Security council on its emergency gathering through agreed statement ask for immediate stop of Violent activities from Israel and Palestinian.
although Israel official said that it will continue its action in Gaza until he believe that rockets attack end on Israel.
what is your suggestion about Israel it is right this action is for try to defense stability of Israel?
is international world do its part in this scenario?
does this intense action link to Israels upcoming next election?
is American newly elected president Barak Obama  after take his position would any improvement in middle east?

Palestine is the holiest place for Muslims till the end of the word and its safety is our necessary part.
and we have to remember that this is our first Qiblah

"When has the night of loneliness been spent shedding tears,
When has a calamity been averted only by supplication" (Nawab Zadah Nasrullah Khan)
BBC searches for such comments and publishes them.
After all it has to keep up the flag and perception of non-alignment.
As such, the news on BBC is usually true, but the main thing is the tone.
Which thing should be highlighted and which piece of news should be given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
In this practice, our Pakistani Wire-net media, in particular some columnists and newspapers are not far behind any more, as they are writing with courage against the growing extremism and terrorism and stressing a lot upon 'Muawiyah hate'.
He said that the United Nations which speaks of human rights and peace, but though the Muslims ar being oppressed greatly, you hear them say that until Hamas does not stop it's attacks, this unfair policy will continue.
Why Muslims are getting abused, If People like America will leave the back support of Jews then Allah has said clearly that this caste will spend there life contemptible and this caste can not spend there life good,  if American Citizens has the guts to leave the Back support of Jews then see the Fortune of the life of Jews
The People who are killing and murdering the people on the name of peace and justice they have to understand this clearly that in this world peace will come only and only by administer an Oath not by doing injustice and semination
If only by doing semination u can kill the caste and want to withdraw the results what you want then after Hitlers Measure not only the Jews caste was continued but in one way the ascent as today was impossible
In the Words of Poet
Abuse is again an abuse if its get higher it will be erased
Blood is again a Blood if it falls down it will Freeze
Now who will say to whom that what is Terrorism?
Why this all does not comes under Terrorism, why only our pain is seems to be like every ones pain
Why the other people are not the human beings or only Muslims blood has become so cheap, these many innocents blood was not red in color
Now from any where why the condolence message is not coming?
I watched the progress of the Mumbai incident, as if my own house was on fire. The sorrow of humans can not be watched, and who can not see this sorrow? If only Muslims would think a bit, together.
How can words derogate the bodies strewn on the streets, helpless innocent faced people, injured and soaked in blood?
I feel like crying about the helplessness of Muslims, that on one side, people are dying in India, and the whole world is climbing onto Pakistan, without any proof and saying, take action or else we will.
And on the other side, Israel is ruthlessly killing Muslims and the whole world is silent. This is unbearable.
There is delay, but no darkness, with God. That too, when this darkness comes to pass.
Danger to Israel, with America present, is a joke.
As for elections, there is no doubt, to gain public support, such actions will have to be taken for the sake of power, especially in a state like Israel. As for Barack Obama, history is witness that no American ruler has been able to go against the American policy and nor will they go. Whether the ruler is white or black, he is still a ruler.
From the discussions going on in the forum, it seems that everyone is hurt over her death, but as a politician, her mistakes have not been ignored.
This issue is debatable, as to whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was dearer, why did she leave the republic for ten years in the control of Musharraf, waiting for American clearance and deal?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the people needed her the most, unfortunately she came to Pakistan when she had to deal with cases and was promised a seat of power.
The blames that are being laid down on historical figures and not addressed by anyone.
Sana Khan
As some things are over looked under these circumstances nothing can be done.
One more Kari
Ladies and gentlemen maybe due to studying the history in not only Pakistan but in its four friend nations and seven other nations, you find the arguments of Mr Psycho more appealing.
Tariq Ayyaz
Those who don't deserve such education shouldn't get it either.
The reflection of the pine in water never got to be green.
Britain never allowed the two to be united and always came up with a new Hindu Muslim conflict which was looked after by Sir Syed.
Psycho
How merciless is our nation. We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.
We have succeeded a lot!
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar if you en wreathe him with books.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks but Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.
If they talk about war then both the sides will suffer human loss.
India says that Pakistani citizen is caught in Bombay attacks. And he has written and sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. But earlier, when India caught this extremist, said that he is a smart engineer but later they declared him to have studied only four grades. This is what has to be considered.
First of all, merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and  all christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
we do not want the flames of fire but flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
will war give solution to problems.
it will bless with fire and blood.
will give hunger and exigence.
therefore wise humans
its better to avoid war
in yours and ours yards
its better that the glim keeps lightened
the India-America relations have deepened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
This is that old history of America.
Because in the case of an Indian attack, America's goals will also be fulfilled and the expenses will be India's.
Pakistan should clearly announce that it will not start, but if injury is caused, there will be no talks of peace or truce, and the war will not stop until India is completely destroyed or captured, even if it involves our destroying ourselves.
This is Islamic history.
Before the resolution, the message that had to be given by the public and the army was given.
In compensation for the Mumbai attacks, the abnormal diplomatic and military benefits that India tried to gain, made it more a victimizing party, than a victim. That is why, in contrast to the harsh initial global reactions, the world has now reduced their force on Pakistan.
The satisfaction expressed by the United Nations over Pakistani efforts and the praise by the Interpol leader of Pakistani efforts, in disregard of India's commotion, shows the side effect of India's more than necessary diplomatics.
There is no two opinions about this being a very beastly action.
But the question is, that when thousands of Taliban were attacking Pir Samiullah's town, where was the Pakistani Army, and what were they doing?
Should the army not be taken into account, as to what they did there for one year?
Every day, how many Taliban die due to the firing of the thousands of mortar and canon shells they fire?
I appeal to the ICI that they stop their guardianship of the Taliban, for Gods sake, and let us live peacefully in paradise like Swat.
And they stop this fixed operation.
The day is not far, when a resolution will be passed in the United Nations, against army intervention in Pakistan, in the same way as it was passed against Jama'athud-Da'wah.
Riyaz Ahmad Farooqi
First of all, our radicalism and our protecting them, is alone, sufficient to provide complete proof and permissibility for action against us. And the very day such a resolution is passed, there is all probability that no voice will be raised in our support, in the United Nations.
And supposing the passing of such a resolution is delayed,some other strength will definitely leave our aid to ourself,, keeping the example of America in front of them.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
As the bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are deathless even after being dead.
But here an international game is being played. Here ferrocity and animosity is created to do the ruling.
So there can be reason created that if we are not here then these vandals and animals can come take over the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
America sees the torture of these extremists but instead of being sad on these faithless activities, they easily name them as tribal culture.
The reason for these faithless activities, sometimes given in the name of tribal culture and other times in the name of Islam, is not something done by a person with a heart.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so brave that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also men of God and so is our army.
It is very clear that there is fishy.
instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and lesson gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell,
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Who burnt the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on the refusal of oath after the Prophet (PBUH) passed away and how took her husband by the rope in his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
Was the attack on Medina by the the Army of Yazid and and the incident of Karbala was the conspiracy of Jews and Pagans?
Without accepting the facts, neither motives can be removed nor these can be corrected?
BBC people, stop this dual policy.
The better super hit title than this is:  the beating  of Bush with shoes is right or wrong?
this should have been the topic.
Tahir Chowdary, Japan
Be ashamed, the body of a person was taken out of the grave and hanged on a pole because he spoke against the cruelty and you are struck up over the topic of Box Office.
The success of operation Sherdil and across the border the success of operation Lion Heart depends on the direction of sympathies of common folk.
This step is of American and Pakistani intelligence agencies and Pir Sahib is the victim of this conspiracy
All the comments on this forum would be against the Taliban because intelligence agents have successfully infiltrated in the Taliban ranks and they are carrying out such actions that can change their perception of people.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public. They even report something like this 'Bombing on Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000, in Swat went there to do.
That the bodies of the Taliban who helps the army is left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake stop this drama.
These Talibans have tarnished the Muslim image.
If in the whole world true Muslims don't call these terrorists as Muslims then how come these elements are able to live in the lands of true Muslims.
Those who become shameless, can't do hard labor they pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
There is no allowance of this in any religion or family traditions.
Including BBC all the media present their views in different styles on Taliban or the tribal people.
But no one is aware of the ground realities or what the truth is. It is us the tribal people who know what rally is the matter.
In short, its a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a talib or a tribal. Who made these institutions? Warmongers who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions.
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute the leader of MQM, Althaf Husain, and the leaderships of ANP and PPP, as they have spoken against this cancer, i.e. the Taliban.
This cancer was given birth to by Zia-ul-Haqq. He has gone, but he has destroyed Pakistan as he went.
But I have hope that the present government will eradicate this cancer.
After the Mumbai attacks, India had said that there was the hand of some Pakistani extremists behind the attack.
Pakistan refuted these claims and said that it would help India in investigation in every possible way.
India said that they have given Pakistan a list of the suspected extremists which India wanted.
Now, Pakistan said that the Jaish-e-Mohammad leader, who is included in the list, Moulana Mas'ood Azhar, is not under house arrest, and that the government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Previously, the President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari had rejected the idea that western intelligence agencies and the Indian government had provided Pakistan proof about the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said regarding Ajmal Kasab, that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
At that time,Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that their relationship with India could not improve as long as their land continues to be used for terrorism.
And in the latest developments, the Indian cricket team cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should these political events affect sports.
What do you see the future of Indo-Pak relations looking like?
Neither America nor India will break Pakistan.
Pakistan will break itself.
With so much regionalism, factionism and infiltration, what else can you expect?
Time has proved that Jinnah did not do good to the Indian Muslims.
Yasmin, Chicago
Madam, if work was continued in Jinnah's manner, neither would the tumors of regionalism, factionism and infiltration have spread in Pakistan, nor would the Indian Muslims been treated in this way.
But it is our fault that we couldnt reproduce a leader of similar stature.
If we can't respect our leaders then
There are many able people in this part of the world.
God knows when some sense will return to the people and when the blessing of consensus in opinion will help develop this area.
In both countries the Mullahs, Pundits, Taliban, Shiv Sena and the RSS etc have been established to oppose the peace process.
And destructive forces don't want this area to develop and for this these countries are manipulated like puppets.
Can you imagine with the aid of consensus between Pakistan, India and China what position they would have in the world.
It is Gods punishment who has positioned thieves, robbers and manipulators as leaders of this country.
May God safe guard Pakistan from any harm, Amen.
But sir open your eyes and look around and see the current situation and ground realities that reveal the extent to which the American have progressed.
moreover, the internal affairs don't seem to be good, as you can see the circumstances in NWFP, Balochistan and in Karachi in Sindh.
in this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
O Allah bestow your mercy upon us.
Account to my understanding, a final war is inevitable.
this is enough of it.
now it should be do or die.
this problem can not be solved through these acts of insincere dialogues.
and not through small scale terrorism in each other's country.
after all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
and if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all of our political parties agree on this matter that these terrorist and denominational activities should be terminated from the country.
But our army rule does not seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, American and Europe are made to believe that we are with you on this war against terrorism and the other hand, we also help Taliban secretly.
We have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way. Thank you.
There is no doubt in this that majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are the members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined  the party  named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.
Although these members preferred subsidiary activities and now after India's great persistence, The United Nation has invalidated it also and Government of Pakistan is continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it is better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
Terrorist groups present in Pakistan, who support professional criminals and the heads of those Mullahs are those who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.
And now they are doing everything to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called Human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan from these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous or not?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose work is only to kill.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What kind of world is this where it is hard to live for one who takes the name of one major pillar of Islam,  religion of Allah.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims but when Muslims even try to take revenge, all our hypocrite leaders together with all the non-muslim world treat people with the true and right pain of religion just like our great leader Hafiz Saeed is being treated today.
India in impunity of Bombay attacks.
Pakistan relation are bitter. Better relationship as a result of last few years between the two countries have been jolted  greatly.
India has always held the military and non-military groups in Pakistan responsible.
And bringing relationship back on track is being conditioned by operations against these groups.
For as much, Indian security departments have held Lashkher-e-Tayyaba responsible for the Bombay attacks.
in this way many times Jamat Ul Dawa Names came up.
this was not first time that terrorism cause intense relation in between two countries.
on December 2001 after attack on Indian parliament this two neighbors came to the front of war.
and after put sanction against Luskaray Taiba and include it in a list of terrorist organizations.
now on Jamat UL Dawa , about which security analyst said that this is new face of Laskaray Taiba, asking for sanctions.
what is your suggestion should this group sanction or not?
Should Pakistan need to take action against terrorist group on its land?
does put sanction on Jamat Ul Dawa present India
Pak crisis could resolve and for real peace in between two countries how important is that to finished groups who have weapons?
United Nations Security Assembly put sanction against Jamat Ul Dawa, in last what evidence Security council have to shows that much hurry?
Public Tranquility Council will always never show this much of expertness against Muslims?
This we say as Accuser is Weak and witness is Strong!
If you see India has make it self as a Disappointed Country
Whom so ever Intelligence, Military and other Security Departments has been disappointed, only few terrorists has made them to dance for 72 hours and now India on his disappointment they are blaming Pakistan for this and trying to ruse the whole world
If one non Muslim is murdered den the voices will be raised from whole world, why is this Double Mentality?
To my Dearest Countries one and only non politics, Religious, Cultural Organization -----------
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
Till the time Prophet PBUH, Saints and the Follower has given the respect to the Human beings, With Peace the Religion Islam was advertised a lot and was going on
Muslims has also got the Success on every Ground
When this Beautiful Religion has came to a normal person then the human beings has started differentiating the Muslim and non Muslim and then the New chapters of tumults and quarrel has been started, earlier the world was not aware of this
Do greet them sir. But at your own expense.
Don't do it under the pressure of America.
If India has any complaints, then it should come up with evidence.
Why don't they do so?
Why do they blame everything on us?
Extremist groups are also present in India, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the world?
Who can India explain its actions in Kashmir?
and what of the actions of Israel?
The truth is that we are the first Nuclear Islamic state in the world and that is the cause of all the hatred.
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart and circumstances also seems to be such
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be the part of this conspiracy.
American are not slowly but now very swiftly tightening there grip over Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances,if we as a nation does not display unity and solidarity then if Bangladesh can be created,anything else can also happen.
More the terrorism is condemned lessor it is , whether it is in a Hotel at Mumbai or it is in Marriott Hotel Islamabad or it is in Palestine.
Like wise irrespective of the origin of the terrorist, these should be eliminated, no matter these are Pakistanis or Indian or American or Israelite.
Now the question is that why the whole world including the Pakistani officials are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack carried out on Marriott Hotel was not a terrorist attack?
Then why?
Praise the worthy Advisor interior,Mister Rehman Malik,by the grace of God, how brave he has become!

Not only this , according to the BBC Mister Malik has also tried to negate this impression with full strength that all these imprisonments are being carried out on whose orders.
Praise the lord!
Having this capability or not, this I don't want to say.
Whose war we Pakistanis are fighting
and why. We have our own priorities which we shall protect with our full strength.
Nobody has an authority to interfere in any other country.
Apparently colonial period does not seem to exist.
If people are expecting justice, then they should impower law inforcing agencies and should respect the democratic   institutions and they should not help dictator or any military personal. Then the 3rd world country Pakistan can attain   peace and that would be unacceptable for the Extremist groups.
Pakistan is already in favour of Europian Union and America.
Even though majority of groups in Pakistan are against this favour.
So this promotes more opposition.
And if America and its allied forces should leave Pakistan and believe in democracy, then the people will start supporting the soveriegnity by stopping their protest.
Pakistan is capable of deciding the issues by either dialogues or by arms.
Pakistani forces occupying Kashmir raided one of the camps of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba.
After Mumbai Attacks pressure is on Pakistan that it should increase the operation against Extremist Organisations.
. India claims that in Mumbai attacks Lashkar-e-Tayyaba was involved.

It is their claim that without a doubt, the extremists who carried out the Mumbai attacks used Pakistani land.
In the meanwhile, officials in Peshawar claim that the lot of trucks which carry supplies to the united forces in Afghanistan was burnt by unidentified armed people, because of which more than 50 trucks were destroyed.
This is the second attack in Peshawar on NATO and American supplies in the last 48 hours.
In the meanwhile, Pakistan captured an established camp of the almost inexistent Lashkar-e-Taiba. Previously, lots of efforts were carried out to try to disarm armed groups all the way from Karachi to the tribal regions, which included giving compensation to those who returned their weapons and even ascertaining them that no action would be taken against them.
The situation is telling us that the efforts undertaken in the regime of General Ziyaul Haqq, after the previous Soviet Union's interference in Afghanistan to get rid of the armed groups that formed as a result of the resistance that started through American and Saudi funding, and to bring an environment similar to that before 1980 were not successful.
The question is what does Pakistan want to do?
Does Pakistan have the ability to do so?
What do you say?

I have only one question from all humanitarian leaders.
You murder their children and they bring garlands for you?   That's impossible

knowledge of east and west is there any logic, reason or philosophy which allows killing of innocent people including Namazi, laborers and poor service men in the revenge of American attacks
If your answer is no then you need to correct your point of view.
People were armed because there was a danger of Russia coming towards Pakistan after Afghanistan.
Now when the danger is that America can attack Pakistan form the channel of Afghanistan which was mentioned directly in the presidential campaign by the president himself. Then why should unarmed these people?
Just because America and India will not have to face any public resistance after defeating Pakistan army.
Yes if any of them are involved in terrorist activities then only Pakistan should take action against them.
But the sad fact of the matter is that leaders of Lashkare Tayyaba declared the accusations of India correct that Pakistan was involved.
Najeeb Ur Rehman Psycho *Lahore*
Even if this is accepted that Lashkare Tayyaba is involved, still the blame cannot be placed on the Pakistani Government.
And another question arises that did these terrorists not have the aid of some government or non-government employee of India.
Are the Terrorist only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not prepared in India or other nations of the world.
As far as Laskare Tayyaba is concern it has no involvement in the recent incidents.
This should be kept in mind that Hafiz Saeed was the first Jihadi leader who claimed that the actions of Taliban were a Fitna.
I believe without a doubt that all the actions of the Taliban were an integral part of the American scheme, therefore it is necessary to eradicate anyone and everyone who stands in the way of Taliban.
Despite the co-operation of the entire nation, launching an operation under the pressure of India shows the stature and non existant leader ship qualities of Zerdari and Co.
The operations started with American and Saudi funding has to come to an end and to do so it should be requested of them that for god sake wipe out this filth that is consistently polluting our society.
And also protest against them asking them based on what ethics, America and Saudi spread dangerous weapons and so called Jihadi, but in reality hate inciting and cultural virus enticing literature in our country, because of which our country has become a human slaughterhouse.
After facing the risk of attack from India, the Pakistani Army's announcement that it would remove forces from the Afghan border and post them at the Indian border, and the announcement of the Taliban that it would handle the Afghan border, caused America to stumble, and pressurize India not to attack Pakistan.
This showed the strength of America in the region.
Though India did not warn that they would attack, and nor do they have that much courage.
The Taliban attacked and finished most of the remaining American supplies.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and tha Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi is the trade and financial center of Pakistan, and the Dubai of the backward regions.
Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty handed, but ever since the law and order situation in the western border regions was lost, all people diverted their attention here.
Now they waant to kidnap this city.
For the first time, Pathans began to be called Pukhtons, and the people of a single town are made foreigners and are being made to fight, while the need is for unity.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speaking learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu, or its better that everybody learns English.
You must be thinking its a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
that the cause of the torture would be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir in my childhood I had actually given the same suggestion many times to my friends ,which included people from every religion and rhetoric groups, but my friend people used to laugh over these suggestions.
at that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not that live and powerful but they were boiling inside.
its hard to understand that what is happening and why?
are these the signs of the judgement day?
what are these innocent and innoxious people being killed for?
the reason is in front of everyone, ones who want to break Pakistan into pieces are active and those who do all this neither belong to any religion nor a country.
Be it Karachi or Mumbai, house set fire by its own resident (this is an phrase used to say that the inhabitants to the city destroying their own city)
which ever government comes to power changes the name of important infrastructure projects like airports, major roads, buildings, presently this is the case and buildings, airports etc have been renamed as Baynazeer (name of a very famous political leader of Pakistan assassinated during a public speech)
Does Baynzeer means what is going on with the people of Karachi and Pakistan ?
While Mumbai attack was on peak, the initiative taken by RAW(Indian spy agency)to start sectarian violence was busted and this event proves that in past political figures on RAW's payroll have now given up the job.
Spilling of innocent blood of Pushto speaking people and by India threatening many a times, have waked up the Pakistani's from Karachi to Khyber.
All strict applause of anger from political, religious, sectarian and national bodies is now teaching India the manners of diplomatic speech. They have provided American strategists a chance to think again.
Thosse responsible for the turmoil in Karachi are Mutahida and Awami National Party ANP where as the establishment is inclined towards one party and nor neutral.
The establishment could had controlled the events in an hour but intentionally allowed to the event to escalate.
Police and Rangers abstained from taking any action since they were in pressure from political parties.
The talks about a unity amongst political parties on the issue is limited to paper only. Party will have to forgo their own vested interests and work for the interests of a common man
until there is pressure on the administration, these kind of incidents will keep taking place.
I think these people are the biggest terrorists.
and foreign powers are definitely involved in this but no one knows who they are?
but alas that if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there, but since its not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
the government should operate here and save a large and very important city of the country from terrorism
otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
BBC Urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure and Pakistani media's condition is already weak.
the whole truth is there on BBC English.
one solution to the problem is that either Urdu speakers should learn Pushto or Pushto speaking learn Urdu or better if every body learns English.
you will definitely take is as a funny suggestion but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
that language is the reason of violence?
There was another story of cruelness recorded in Karachi, terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
Wherever one could do something, he did everything. Reports on the media are 50% of what has happened here in four days.
Stayed awake in the last four nights and still afraid.
Who evacuated hotels, killed cobblers peanut sellers.
causing depredation on Super highway and cutting off ears of the innocents are all not aware of the punishment of Allah, which will catch them one day.
In your opinion, what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
Placing in front of us the heart struck attacks of Bombay, we certainly do not have to dive to find the reasons for this disturbance in Karachi. But there is one simple and easy reason that this disturbance was the result of spilling of blood subconsciously.
It is evident that if some one will knock kneed with the father, it is not unusual for the son to get out of control.
The blood of Liyaqath Ali Khan and many other brave hearts was also from there. I am writing this poem to get rid of Saiko's misunderstanding.
We will also repeat the traditions of the elders
They gave their lives to build, we will give our lives to save.
Faizan Touseef Siddiqi
It is very sad that we are fighting each other at a time when the whole country is under attack.
I tell Mr. Siddiqi that if he checks Wikipedia.org
for Liyaqath Ali Khan, then he will know that he was from a repectable Punjabi family, in the Karnal region of Punjab district.
Because of his steps for immigrants, today the immigrant call him their own.
Every action has a reaction.
One can bear ones self, but..
Consequences of noises.
many of us who live in large towns and cities have grown used to working in noise which comes from several different sources. There is the noise of moving trains which is heard at almost all hours of the day.
The Jet planes that fly over head produce noise of even greater loudness and intensity.
Most of us have no time to think of noises on one type or another.
They become part of our daily lives.
But there is something to be thought of-does noise affect our lives in some harmful ways.
already there is evidence that it does so in several ways. It has been recognized for a long time.
Now that exposure to noise high intensity leads to loss of hearing. There have been cases of boiler-makers, for example, whose suffer from occupational deafness.
More recently it has also been found that people who are continuously exposed to other loud noises require protection of the ear.
If we live in industrial areas which are growing with every passing year, there is the deafening noise produced by the speakers in house or shops, radio sets in the neighborhood, school children at play or at chorus practice of arithmetical tables, and so on.
MQM is i coalation with government, Muslim League(N) is secret partnership with government and Muslim League(Q) is the party that passed 17Th ammendment, then how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17Th Amendment
This is the way to get ones name entered in the list of martyrs by just getting painted.
The Peoples Party is otherwise not in hurry to end the seventeenth ammendment.
How any one can think of getting his own hands cut.
Seventeenth Ammendment cannot be abolished till Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of majority in one of our survey and it is also correct.
Zardari would not have opted to be the President, if seventeenth ammendment was to be abolished.
Now he is more powerful than President Musharraf, since along with President he is also  the chairman of Peoples Party.
The seventeenth ammendment is there till he is the president.
Political Parties will have to remove President Zardari first, in order to abolish  the seventeenth ammendment.
This is not the will of MQM nor of other parties.
In our family, most of the people are of the laborer type.
And in our childhood, when we used to see our uncles toil, we used to wish in our hearts that Allah save us from labor that is hard on the body.
To save ourselves from this, we wrote a letter to the editor of the Amroz daily, asking him what we can do after metric to save ourselves from having to toil.
The editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and take such and such subjects.
My focus was always on engineering, and after metric, instead of Biology, I took Technical Drawing.
But while entering the FSC, my elder brother forced me to do FSC in medicine and become a doctor.
I studied Biology for a month with great difficulty, and when I still could not understand anything, I took maths as a subject instead.
So the scare of having to work made me an engineer, and today I am in a very good condition compared to many of my same aged relatives, for which I am always thanking Allah.
I remembered this when I was trying to lift the carpet of my old house along with my two young sons.
It was not half an hour since we started working, that the younger son said "Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job"
We said, if that is true, then study a lot like us, and free yourself from bodily pain.
The son said that I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work.
Anyway, the three of us finished that work in three hours and returned.
My purpose of saying this is that if a person has set a goal, whatever be the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving his goal.
But if you do not even know what you have to do, then Allah alone is your protector.
They say that you should not speak bad about the dead, but what can I do, even after one year of Benazir's death, I can only see faults in her.
For personal interests, Benazir handed over the list of Sikhs who were fighting for independence to India, at the same time crushing the Sikhs independence movement and also allowing India to transfer its complete attention to Pakistan, having taken care of the Punjab movement.
The Russia wars in the regimes of Benazir and Nawaz Sherif have become a part of history, which pushed the country many years back.
Benazir continued to speak ill about Kashmir and the atomic program throughout exile.
Benazir Bhutto struck a deal with Musharraf, going against her London Treaty with Nawaz Sharif
Benazir allowed her husband to openly earn money, in her era, which is why he came to be known as Mr. Ten Percent.
In Benazir's era, her brother was killed, and his killer is still not been punished.
Despite being a woman, Benazir avoided fighting for women rights.
In a way similar to how Benazir did politics on her father's corpse, her widower husband is now doing politics on her corpse.
Benazir came to power twice, but let alone bring the people guilty for the political killing of her father to justice, she could not even file a case against them.
It is 37 years since East Pakistan was separated from us, and look at the height of insensitivity on the part of the public and the rulers, that no one ever mourned or expressed sorrow over their mistakes.
We should have been observing 16th December as a day of reflection, and made plans to prevent the re occurrence of such incidents.
We should have been sending greetings to the people of Bangladesh on this day and been trying to bring them closer to ourselves.
The ruler should have opened the Jamudur Rahman commission file and pondered over the causes of separation of West Pakistan, mentioned therein.
to help the people who are sick and in trouble in Bangladesh and for their safe return planning and for motivation gifts are sent to them.
we have no feeling, our neighbors get died and we dont even know about it
we don't  care about brothers and sisters because we are selfish.
big crisis get over and we became normal and return to our routines.
As eastern Germany and western Germany merges together i wish if East and West Pakistan get together.
we can be one again, if we scarifies for each other and get over with our selfishness.
This wish (dream) cant seem to come true in near Future.
Today in new it was said that Governor of  illinois is arrested for corruption.
to remove him from the office of Governor, State Congress is preparing to start trial against him as soon as possible. one of our friend who has keen eye on the current affairs of Pakistan proudly said that this is democracy.
In USA Every man is equal under Law.
And there is your country, whose president was made after he had the corruption charges dropped.
we felt our nerve of wit and said that what if a governor was arrested in America,in our Pakistan once our prime minister was arrested during the night and was hanged and the other time was exiled.
Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
Pakistan awarded guard of honor and bid farewell from the president house who broke the law of the country. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
Chief Justice of Pakistan was laid off in such a way that even after nations support, he has yet not reinstated. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
In Pakistan, fake degree holder was appointed as health minister, Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
After listening to this, poor American could not stop laughing and also accepted defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by Americans from all sides.
It seems from his smile
that America is with his government. But he is forgetting that last year the same people was with Parvez Musharaf.
Thus psychotherapy gained popularity.
Whether there is madness in method or method in madness, there is certainly a method in dealing with madness.
That said, mental health care has come a long way from merely addressing dementia to dealing with problems such as stress, depression, anxiety and relationship problems.
When she finished her MA in counseling psychology from Columbia university.
The center offers support services for depression, anxiety,stress, learning problems,personality. deficiencies
Material problems and workplace issues.
It also offers employee assistance programs for corporates.
There are enough opportunities in the fields of counseling and psychotherapy.
Traditionally both roles were played by psychiatrists, who not only counseled patients.
Research has revealed that there are conditions which can be cured without medication.
It is required that the government finish the causes of this problem, rather than use force.
By finishing the causes, Fazlullah and the Taliban will be finished themselves.
The proposed Shariah bill of the ANP government will become a moderate solution to the problems in Swat.
But alongside the establishment of the Shariah, the government will also have to take care of economic problems.
From General Musharraf's initial few steps, it looked as if the nation would be freed of useless politicians, but the love for power changed all his plans.
Whatever expectations were, after joining the 'war of terror', he began to consider himself irremovable.
And whatever steps were expected were no more.
Just as Bush's rule began to close, he started to worry about the end of his own rule, and he struck a deal with thieves in the dark.
Even then, General Musharraf could have commanded the army, but the present government does not even know what is happening.
Whether in Bajod or Swat, the army cannot control terror, and instead they bomb the 'enemy', i.e. the public. Apart from loss of life and money, if they are making the 'enemy' psychologically ill, then we are the enemies, aren't we?
The conditions in the  terrorism struck area Swat in the Frontier Province are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area
On the one side the governments writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side the effect of Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everday in Swat.
On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.
The result is that on the one side the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other hand the Taliban has established their hold.
In between who got grinded, the poor citizens.
It is said that in Swat somebody asked, which type of people are the Taliban's are? The answer was  "very good people because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country".
Then asked how is Army, the answer was that the Army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.
Then it was asked, who are the enemies of religion and country, the answer was "the citizens"
I am astonished, how the Pakistan Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban's.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
But still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
After the girls schools, now boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfews are called so that the Taliban can move around easily.
During curfew tonight, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
The question arises as to how they got there despite the curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone explain to the army to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the Army can defeat any enemy.
You say that mostly blood is spilled in the world because of religion. Tell me today, if there was no religion, would all this killing not take place?
Are Punjabi, Pathan, White, Black, Mahsood and other tribes the result of religion?
No, sir, no way! Only religion teaches that there is no black and white, there is no Punjabi and no immigrant. If it were not for religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between the white and the black, and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribe-brotherhood hatred.
Actually, only religion trains man's character and restricts him, as he has not come here on his own will, but rather the Creator of all that exists sent him here, and he must live here according to His commands.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France, for two years, I also felt the same way.
I do not know why people only expect us to call.
A resolution about Iraq, passed in a few hours, to send a 'peace' force to Darfur is not at all a problem.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where there is a matter of death, we are still holding meetings about that.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
Is it for real that every one is waiting for its end?
So that no other victim will even think about using a great damage causing weapon like a sling shot to fight for his rights?
Doesn't your hear ache even when a father is running holding his son's dead body?
If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
But you are a shame to the name of humanity.
At least this was proven that this area was also Israel's country for thousands of years.
What should happen is that both the nations should live together happily and with love but since they are controlled by the west and arab countries, therefore peace can not be formed here with out their consent.
But even Iran wants to fight its proxy war here now.
Even if operations in Israel are stopped for the time being, they will start again after some other incident.
The interest of BBC's country is subject to the bestowing of America and Israel. And this is the reason why in the name of "enlightenment", they have come with a series of blogs based on "darkness" and doing one-way and a blind propaganda.
BBC is just doing formality and to gain sympathy is their only purpose and wish!
mr moderator is requested that he may publish the commentry by this humble soul so that one can guess BBC still has some integrity left.
Thankyou.
who knows about the author and the origin of this story but the fact remains, in every era draculas have fed on innocent blood.
Every era has seen war as well as blood shed.
surprisingly twenty first century man who considers himself very civilized is silent over this murder done publically in the day light.
how can he not realize that whatever is happening is showing the ugliest face of humanity

At this time along with Dera Ghazi Khan, in whole country winter rains are goin on.
Presented is a poem according to the season. Enjoy the rain along with this poem.
These rains are also from you
which when fell brings spring.
When it stops there is no movement
sometimes it came just like that, without a reason.
Sometimes it spread day and night.
sometimes loudly, sometimes silently.
These rains are also from you
in some remembrance some night
on some suppressed ashes
Sometimes we blew out the flames.
Sometimes we burnt ourselves.
Sometimes every drop is like pain.
And these rains are only because of you.
All these leaders are going to run away with their briefcases in hand, what do they care about what will happen to the country.
Let the population sell toothpaste or clean the bells of the Mandir with the peels of lemons.
And then our media is also fraudulent like our leaders.
The purpose of it is to get money out of the government, and nothing else.
And as far as the population goes they can remain stupid because talking about them would be an even bigger stupidity.
Yesterday a strange incident took place.
All together police running here and there but not ask on illegal parking
and moreover that NYPD traffic was also not in a mood to look at illegal parked cars.
it happened like this that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in Hudson river.
Till now it is just known this that "Terrorists" relation was with birds race Goose.
Yesterday was maybe New York's historic cold
Temperature do not drop to this degree
Me my own jaw is beginning to hurt after half hour of stroll outside.
Imagine that what would have happened to those people who jumped from plane in the river.
Happy news is that people all together stayed safe
and sad news is that ship of company sank in this financial crisis.
I reached New Jersey from west site e way and also saw that south bound is closed and still what have i done?
When i was returning i was stuck in traffic.
Thank God in my one hour trip i was lucky to find one road to 56th street exit.
And i didn't see the lines in that exit.
Maki, My Pakistan: Same to you in reply of Eid Mubarak.
Ammaar: Ofcourse with faith.
Shagufta: Same to you in reply of Eid Mubarak.
Sara: I sacrificed two chickens and cooked as i know.
I didn't know any other method.
In this farm you have to cook the meat by yourself including removing the chicken's skin
Basam: Dot net could take a time to get right.
what happen on form?
Link.

Deafer: wish you, you too Eid Mubarak.

just a while before this, the wedding of a dog with a girl took place.
look at that groom.
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
it is the era of computers and its involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life.
many people have many reservation over this increasing involvement of computer, for example, in financial matters.
where use of credit card bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
so now only through your financial matters like through your credit card, you can be located.
and in future when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent, its benefits will increase more and more.
similarly in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, the credit card information is stolen.
similarly computers have become the source of friendship.
Social networking websites like orket, face book and my space have the first accepting level.
But is it not come to your mind that as we obey these social net works as we are being away from the people in act.
So, this way you have been seen your wanted people and their index in the match making website.
Now can you spend your life with a person like you?
I can not spend and for this the wife is also called half body.
That she fulfill the un completions i have.
I am probably low gifted from mind.
I considered true all the talking from any elder.
And such i had assurance that my father know the answer of every question of the world.
There was laughed upon me for it.
But only that seems true which can be possible.
It is very troubling, that what is the need to tell lies.
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
That is why I try to lie as less as possible.
that I do not falsely please others, that too with the name of Allah.
And that I say Insha Allah (If God Wills) only when I am asking Allah to complete the work.
As for the intentions, only Allah knows best.
This is a despicable matter that arose due to distance from religion.
According to both our religion and Pakistani law, young children should stay with their mothers.
Their expenses are to be borne by the father, and the father can meet his children.
then when they become mature, they live with whom they wan to live.
You are right that the actual problem are the relatives who misguide.
feudalism has overshadowed our deeds.
Even here is thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in father's property so it is resisted, although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated.
here these restriction regarding making of relations have created many evils in the society.
concept of remarriage of a divorced or a widow is getting rare.
due these unnecessary beliefs and tradition the family system is facing disarray.
in our society, if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarry, then why it is not appreciated?
there is a Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago, now after getting all his children married when he married a widow, his own children have gone against him.
In my opinion, this is religious right, what do you say?
Until we are alive we will never accept that any one else can take the place of my mother, is this kind of thought is a thought?
In my view Sirs children has to think that, if after doing the Marriage of all the children, he him self has married to a widow women, so is that any thing wrong he has done?
In this way this widow women has also got some support and that uncle will also get some one to take care of the home (homemaker)
Because that is for sure that his children got busy in there own personal life and they are not giving him time
Reason for this is unknowledgeable
If tomorrow there wifes refuses to serve that old man then what will he do?
This result is because of Societies pressure
When People will laugh on this activity and on there Family then children will feel ashamed on second marriage of there father
Actually they have to defend the situation stating there father has done this according to Islam view
This is one of the curses on our society like we are totally into Venery in past 40-50 years
It is acceptable for a wife that her husband does unlawful actions but she does not let him marry another woman.
If its in her power, she will not let him do so even after she dies.
Destroys her afterlife along with her husbands'.And also lets spreading of the immorality in the society.
Nothing happens with singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.
And about your question, when sir instead of bringing his wife home, goes to someone else's wife so the dependents just make a fuss for the show and stay quiet and satisfied. ( yeah, later the relatives of the wife get angry)
In the Indian subcontinent, we accepted Islam centuries ago but we could not let go of this illiterate thinking and always thought of culture and tradition as more valuable than Islam.
Considering man's 2nd marriage as ridiculous, divorce as denigration, divorced as untouchable, love marriage as dishonor and considering a man marrying an older women is dissimulation of the women is only the result of this way of thinking.
And over all, by copying the western world, we are declaring the religious and veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam was easy, getting rid of this way of thinking is very hard.
Allah give us courage and Daringness.
Amen.
it was not really difficult to write Urdu ever before.

Amir Taimoor Write on his book "i am Tamioor" thati have discovered secret in my life that if any force commander in chief on the first raw so that force never loss.
but that circumstances different there.
it was said lay folk die for our self we die so martyr.
if some one die form Lay folk so killed.
May Allah bless and have mercy on you.
When I was coming back to the shop after Isha prayer tonight, one man who was sitting in  car, raised his hand and asked me to come.
I thought may be this man has forgotten his way or may be he wants to ask something. I stopped so his whole family was in his car.
He asked if I can understand Arabic very well or not. I said that there is no problem. You tell me what is the matter.
He started saying, I have come from Riyadh but here some one in Medina picked my pocket if you please help me. I said forget about it.Because  this has happened with me earlier also as I gave this man 20 riyals to pay for gas and go back to Riyadh but he started doing the same thing after moving forward a little.
I got really angry and when I told him and threaten him of a cop, he vanished from there.
So now this is the condition of us Muslims that even when we come to beg money, we come with families riding in cars and daily manage to get at least 2 to 3000.
Although there is an evident saying of the Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the hand above is better than the hand below and the hand above is the giving hand the lower is the taking hand.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims ( Amen)

Wife of famous singer Adnan Sami, reached a police station in Bombay accusing him of torturing her.
The police station suggester her to contact Court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Guladari submitted a plea against her husband that Adnan Sami tortures her continuously.
and treats her inhumanely.
Now this has exceeded her tolerance limit therefore a case should be recorded against Adnan Sami.
Police instead of recording a report suggested that she should contact the court by saying that this matter is not what comes under police control.
In your opinion, is the accusation of Adnan Sami's wife on him is correct?
What if this accusation is an attempt of tarnishing the name of Adnan Sami?
Let us know of your comments regarding this matter.
Adam Saanghar, stamp.
as far as blames concern so any man can do on other.
nothing more important than respect.
what so ever relation of present wife and Adnan Samih , Adnan Samih leave his respected life and went India to earn money, now this popularity made hurdle for him.
this  is due to his own deed.
Washington.
high level American official said that president Obama made strong policy against Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
on this new policy of America about Afghanistan give more importance on War instead of Development.
Official said that Hamid Karzai consider as a hurdle in Afghanistan to get American Aid, because corruption in the government, intoxication business get increased and Taliban forces get regathered.
American official said that those people from American government who put pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more in which vice president Joe Biden and representative of Brack Obama for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke included.
He said that this policy appeared after President Bush, who used to video conference with Hamid Karzai every two weeks, left. He used to stress upon the American role in rebuilding Afghanistan and its civilian institutions.
Officials say that the Obama government would work with the State leaders rather than the central government.
The officials say that it will pressurize Karzai to step up the war against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing fresh elections this year, and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his group will support Karzai for presidency or not.
This statement of the American officials is not a precursor for a change in the American policy towards Afghanistan, is it?
Is Hamid Karzai's rule coming to an end?
What is your opinion about this?
In a series of three one day matches between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2-1.
Pakistan had defeated Sri Lanka in the first match, but Sri Lanka was victorious in the remaining two matches.
In the third one day match, the national cricket team's performance was very poor. In reply to Sri Lanka's 309 runs, it only managed to hit 75 runs in 23 overs before going all out. As such, it had to face a humiliating loss.
The result of the series shows the inconsistency of our cricket team's performance
Despite the home ground advantage and claims, National team is defeated. Can you give the reasons of this defeat?
Which department of the sport needs more attention of concerning authorities?
If you are satisfied with team selection?
Which department is the major reason of the defeat: fielding, batting or bowling.
Kindly share your opinion.
Malik Babar Hussain, It is sad that such customs of ignorance still exist in this modern age. These feudal target the poor and innocent people, who will believe that they are Muslims?
If any tribal chief proved his innocence by walking on fire. why GOVT does not take action?
When will the judicial justice play its role?
Sri Lankan team has reached Pakistan to play one day series.
besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
upon reaching the Karachi airport, the Srilankan team was very warmly welcomed.
two one days between Pakistan and Srilanka in Karachi whereas the third one day will be played in Lahore.
both teams have there claims over bowling, batting and fielding.
if the Srilankans are proud of their spinners, the Pakistanis trust their fast bowlers.
Srilankan Captain Mahela Jayvardena has said that not a single player from Pakistan team but the whole team is dangerous.
Murli dharan and Mendis will be the trump cards whereas the Pakistan Captain says that it will be a tough competition.
Shoaib Malik has said that we have played Murli dharan and we'll see Mendis as well. we have prepared a secret game plan and we shall implement that in the ground.
will the Pak-Srilanka Series be really as interesting and exciting as the claims are?
who will be dominate the series between Pakistan and Srilanka?
who will win series?
who will be main of the series?
let us know your recommendation.
Gulfam, wants his favorable speech and you are also consider that it is our wish that you should write some truth do not made interpretation as like Mukhurjee because it is order that said right in front of brutal rural and this equal to Jihad what Mukhurjee said tires to get inside in news by changing speech.
Malik Yousuf, Dubai
this all those same people have responsible, Kashmirs fighting for there freedom since last 60 years.
no one ask about that now they have stuck with fundamentalism and fight for terrorism so they now start talking about deal.
first they killed Muslims brutally now they are trying to resolve issues.
although Pakistan have to understand there two way policy.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating this situation to distract world attention away from Kashmir issue.
But Pakistan has always showed true face of India to the world
Now British government has realized that Indian government is maligning Pakistan for terrorism so that it can occupy Kashmir.
They are unwilling to talk with Pakistan on this matter
British foreign minister David Miliband said that by resolving Kashmir issue will end extremism. Pakistan government will be able to handle the border issues.
It should be noted that American president Obama has already expressed similar views on Kashmir issue.
British foreign minister has said while talking to media in Mumbai and also written an essay that the idea of war on terror is wrong. On the basis of threat to oneself killing others was Bush's policy.
David Miliband has said that Pakistan should show lineancy towards extremist groups.
Due to insistance of major powers to resolve Kashmir issue India is creating unrest in the region to distract world from this issue.
Terrorist attack in Mumbai is also a part of this strategy.
Does India want to the allegations of terrorism its escape goat to avoid peace talks?
Tell us your opinion.
Usman Aftab
In my opinion alot of the powerful nations do not want to bring harm to Pakistan.
But are thinking of plans to keep it in their leash as they know that Pakistan is a nuclear power.
They want to fuel a situation for a revolution.
Other nations are thinking that in cornering Pakistan they may face Geographical Political problems, they also want to aid Pakistan but along with that they also want to accomplish their ulterior motives.
A Citizen, USA
Indians have known to be snakes in the grass.
In my opinion they get cramps every now and then which causes them to give baseless threats.
Indian army cheif keep your mouth shut,any way we are ready orelse we know to give you a solid answer.
FM SADIQ
With the help of American wealth Rasil quium gave an ec speach  with which he blowed out American's mind this is wrong,but now   the surprising thing is attack and watch truth will be proved.Who's right.

American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference advised newly elected President Barack Obama saying that he had made many mistakes in his presidency, and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
'I did, as a president, whatever I felt was appropriate, according to the situation, and the American law and constitution, giving preference to American interest over my own acceptance'.
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him, and considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this is my last press conference, and I thank the journalists and other friends who are present in the press conference.

I think the problem lies in the illiteracy of our nation. People do not know how their money is spent. Govt. is solving its problems by introducing new taxes. Power and Gas crisis will remain unsolved
Every body knows the real faces of people's elected representatives.
Power crisis has become worst in Pakistan.
On the other hand price of Gas has been increased by 18%. While due to unavailability of petrol, people are facing sever difficulties.
The business and industrial communities of Pakistan are violently protesting against power and Gas crisis.
The producers have given the ultimatum to close the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is perturbed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
The production life cycle has become practically paralyzed.
The government institutions are blaming each other to express their stand.
Are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas not a joke against the nation?
Why is attention not being paid to solve the problems.
Are the wheels of national development not seeming jammed to the government?
What immediate steps can you suggest to gain control over this crisis?
Let us know of your opinions.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that they are giving difficulty to the public who called for a democratic government.
The unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a torture.
There is no control over government institutions.
The law and order situation is getting worse, day to day. May Allah have mercy on this country.
The New Year started.
The previous year was a year of protests and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered for terrorism.
The removal of President Musharraf from power, and President Bush's eight year regime coming to an end, Bush getting shoes thrown at and the establishment of a democratic government in Pakistan, sudden calamities, the earthquake of Balochistan, the global financial crisis and depression.
Now a new year has arrived, how do you see the new year?

Indian Government has stop Indian cricket team to visit Pakistan
The India cricket team is scheduled to play three tests, five one day and one twenty twenty match on its Pakistan tour.
Vice president of Indian cricket board Mr. Ragiv Shukla told Geo News that he has sought permission for the tour of Pakistan from Indian government but due to current tensions between the two counties the tour has been canceled.
Is the Indian Governments initiative not to allow the cricket team to visit Pakistan on grounds of political reasons justified? Can't sports be kept aside from politics?
Is the Indian Government's decision counter productive for cricket?
Despite security concerns English team visited India then why can't the Indian team continue its tour of Pakistan.
What is you opinion is this regards?
Salman from Karachi
Those people who feel proud of visiting India
and direct or produce their videos in India should open their eyes that what response India is giving.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami in which he said that he is not Pakistani national but a British.
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan at the first opportunity, because he did not get honor there either.
Farid Ahmad
Karachi
After the Mumbai attacks, the mode of the Indians have changed.
Jagjeet Singh reacted by expressing that he hates Pakistan and Pakistanis.
It should be known that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsle and how has he become helpless now? Adnan Sami should stay in India. There is no need for him to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Aalam,
Karachi. I will only say so much about Jagjeet Singh, that he too changes colors like a chameleon,
and speaks on the occasion. Pakistanis, open your eyes and see how much you are respected in India. Do not be dull minded.
After the Mumbai incident, their hate filled speech has increased. Now they are spreading poison about famous singer Adnan Sami.
according to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said "You dog this is a farewell kiss"
after that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards Bush. president Bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself.
second shoe hit the American Flag.
Security personnels dragged the journalist away from there.
at this point, president Bush said that he didn't know why he had done so , Shoe was of number 10, I had no problem.
do you think this reaction of the journalist wasn't an expression of deprecation or President bush from the Iraqi people?
what would you say on this incident?
The tension between Pakistan and India's relations after the terrorism in Mumbai got further intense when the fighter planes from the Indian Air force violated the Pakistani airspace in Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
as a result of retaliation from Pak Air force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
sources say that both Indian planes were loaded with ammunition.
It is the first incident of its nature in the present strained situation.
Pakistan Air Force has affirmed that it is absolutely ready to defend the country .
Federal Minister of Information Sherry Rehman has stated that the Indian leaders have acknowledged the violation of Pakistani airspace, however this happened by mistake.
Pakistan's military sources have declared that this is a grave incident.
Do you think India really intends to launch an air raid on Pakistan?
Is India's claim true, about the violation of Pakistani airspace being a mistake, or is India trying to cover up an attempt made to annalyze the capability of Pakistan Air Force?
This incident will cause an increase in tension between the two countries?

Karachi:  our ministers has to understand that, they operation what they are carrying are the people who respects us, after many damages also they love us.
If there would be war then they will fight for Pakistan.
When their love would be felt, just condenming politics will not work. I think between both, there might be going a resulting war.
