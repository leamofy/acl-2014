'first nuclear experiment was done in 1990'
Thomas Reid who has worked in the Lever national laboratory of America as a Weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the Ex director of technical intelligence at Las Elmos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.
this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.
in an interview with US news, Thomas Reid said that in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's rule, China experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Thomas Reid said that based to many reasons, he has a belief that China had experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
the reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.
he further added that this was the reason that in 1998 only in a span of two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments as a reply to Indian nuclear experiments.
Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiment.
He further said that in May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with a lot of care and Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.
When Thomas Reed was asked this question that China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan so he said in his answer that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.
He said that its evidence is also present that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan has used the Chinese model. Later the documents received from Libya also confirm this.
Another question that is it common to do nuclear experiments mutually. Then he said that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.
He said that we also predict that Israel also has access to the results of this experiment.
Thomas Reeds was also asked if China is continuing nuclear proliferation?
On this Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and the design to a nuclear facility of Iran in its city Asfahan.
Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.
He said that China had been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Rome, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen via North Korea.

The Role of EU for peace in the Middle east.
from official point of view, the role of European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
according to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
European Union's spokesman Amadeu Altafaj has said that every such effort is adorable which is helpful in sending the European Union's message to the opponents of the war.
it seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned.
but in reality the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
as the head of the Union, Czech republic's role is even weaker than before.
an on top of that the internal issues have made is helpless.
on the other hand the French president Sarkozy is behaving like if he is still the president of the European Union.
Whereas France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it.
The most ridiculous situation faces the foreign minister of France, Bernard Kouchner.
He is part of the delegation, which is being headed by Schwarzenberg, the foreign minister of Czech Republic.
What is even worse is that both the foreign ministers are giving different statements on the middle east war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself whereas according to Kouchner this war does not come under defense policy. On the other side, Germany has also sent its special ambassador to Middle East. European Union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues.
Its evidence is the reaction of Israel who does not pay an importance to the conciliation efforts of the EU.
EU has a golden chance of getting something done. Because America has lost in the Middle East due to the policies of George Bush.
Economic setback: Suicide of German billionaire industrialist.
Adolf Meerklay, residing in the area of Sawabia in southern Germany, has though left a great business group behind him.
But earlier common German citizens did not know much about him.
Later when he had to conference, about the loan given to his industrial group, with almost 30 banks for many weeks, he also became topic of the headlines. And he could see a dark future of Meerklay groups.
Marclay Group had to bear the loss of hundreds of million euros after it bought the shares of one of known industry Folks Wigan.
then the financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed 100 Million and 1 billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on Marclay.
Recently the same banks accepted to provide loan to Marclay group on urgent basis but Adolf Marclay who started as a small industrialist to reach a place where his industrial group's annual income reached 30 billion euros, couldn't bear the the loss in his financial strength.
After the death of his father when Adolf Marclay took the responsibility of the business he used modern methods and made the business more successful.
He named his company Ratiopharm which is now Germany's most successful and biggest pharmaceutical company.
Till recent times this phamasutical company had a budget of around 5 to 6 billion euros and even now it is earning around 8 billion euros annually. After the great success of Rasue farm the Marclay Group bought many big industries like Hi-Del Barag Cement a manufacture of construction equipment. Kassbohrer and other good car maker
Marclay Group has a employee number of around 100 thousand around the world and among its industries, Rasue Farm has always been given special importance.
Adolf Marclay has said this many times in his life. ""We have been in pharma business since four generations"".
Now the industry is handled by the children and i hope that it continues to work for few hundred years by our family.
After the suicide of Adolf Marclay,the banks have given approval of temporary loan of 400 million euro for his group VEM but on this condition that VEM have to be sold to  Rasio Farm so that the financial position of this group is improved on long term basis.
Like this, after the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain the same as it was.

Ahlhaus diverted the attention to a research report from the anti crime's provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamberg, it was investigated that out of all crimes happening there what percentage have the involvement of foreigners.
results showed that the foreigners here have
the crime rate was less as compared to the crimes allover the province.
in contrast when in 2006 a survey was done on crimes in youth in Berlin, it came up that young people having foreign background had a percentage of .44
was 7 percent
However, other political parties of Germany for example, SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei were against this proposal that while collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired that which German citizen has a foreign background.

Why is there decrease in exercise with increase in age?
New Research.
Exercise is good for health in any age.
This makes your heart stronger, decreases cholesterol levels, helps in reducing weight, helps stop diabetes and decreases the chances of Alzheimer's.
Unfortunately, a lot of people tend to exercise less with age.
Experts say that exercises keeps our mind and body alert, and affects the real age of a person.
According to the American Medical Association, not getting enough exercise can lead to numerous health issues.
Dr. Patricia Paylekka of the Mew Clinic of Minnesota reports that with increase in age, exercise is a major factor in determining proper body functioning.
Dr Patricia teaches Medicine in Mew Clinic.
She has done extensive research on older age and the ability to exercise with increasing age.
A team of doctors used High Frequency rays to determine the functioning of the heart.
In which, the ability of the heart to pump blood, and it's ability to shrink and relax was researched.
Experts have concentrated mainly on the left side of the heart which is mainly responsible for the pumping of blood.
They discovered that with increase in age, the problems in the rate of heart relaxation also increase.
Dr. Patricia says that with increase in age, the problems in the heart relaxation rates increases and thus effects the ability to exercise with growing age.
Dr. Carwin Cain was also part of this research.
He says that it's surprising to see the permanent effects of improper exercise on the heart.

There has been a detailed report about this in the American Medical Association Publication.
No chances of an immediate war with Pakistan: Indian Army chief
Indian Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan how ever we are always ready to defend our country and sacrifice our lives for it.
He has accused that despite of commitments and international pressure on Pakistan as a result of Mumbai attacks, the infrastructure of terrorism is not only existent but also proactive in Pakistan.
he said this while talking to the correspondents in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day tour to the valley of Kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in New Delhi administered Kashmir and preparation of armed forces on the borders.
He was asked a question, that according to the media reports Pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from India regarding the Mumbai attacks, what were his thoughts about it.
General Kapoor said that the decisions of peace or war matters are taken by the political leadership.
Talking about the presence of the skeleton of terrorism on the land of Pakistan,he said allegedly, that India will fight against such circumstances who are ready to destroy peace and weaken India.
He said that there are around 7 to 800 fighters present on the land of Indian Kashmir from which almost 50% are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that only with the betterment in the weather, the efforts of encroachment between Pakistan and Kashmir under its government can be increased.  Although India has increased security on the boarders.
They have refused to the possibility of reduction in the number of army soldiers in Indian Kashmir by stating that one can not compromise over the country's security.
May God answer the world's prayers and may Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, but we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan , effected by this change, are in our favor.
That what will Mr. Barrack Obama give to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams.
The oath taking of Obama as the president of America, whose part of the name is also Hussain, is where historically important in all the ways, is also a great challenge for the history.
Not only for his own self but also for those who supported him with all their hearts.
This challenge will also be for the white majority as it is not easy for them to accept that a colored man is ruling over them.
Here, South Asia, specially Muslims who have expectations from them, should remember that he has been elected as the president of America. And Obama should remember that President of America is actually the President of the entire world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have to have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, so this will be a win for people who love him.
What will be its effect on South Asia and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan.

Dear, whether it is Obama or some one else, the decision of the policy of the entire world is done by Jews lobby of  billionaires, influencing, powerful and effective people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts,the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is in front of everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat, who had a regular Army and Law.
He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a  pact
but it is matter of sorrow that our government treated Swat like a step mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government of the ruler of Swat.
and no interest was taken in the building and development works
The girls who are getting education today are much lesser in number than  those who used to get educated in the previous era.
In the Frontier Province, there is a continuous targeting of educational institutions by Taliban's.
The maximum number of schools have been destroyed in district Swat in which majority are the girls schools.
It is not just this, the Taliban has imposed a ban on girl education.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.
what do you think, by stopping girls' education, what the Taliban want to achieve?
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities so far.
what do you think the government should do.
the question should be that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
because the people of Swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them, otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that during the Curfew. How come people can be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing.
when the writ of the government is not being let implemented, how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities?
now the question arises that having an armed force, armed with modern weapons, modern technologies and intelligence system, why the government can not control these few Taliban.
the only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head, that neither their arms end nor they are apprehended.
result of the discussion is that Taliban with their wrong steps are making it easier for the imperialists.
fifteen years before the war was continued in Afghanistan.
ISI is controlling Taliban when at that time opponent was north coalition who was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly situation changed, actions of Taliban began to appear.
And ISI was also offered Dollars from America so past friends became enemies.
Now situation is this that war continues but helping in Pakistan are still those Iran, India and Russia.
Unless this feeling does not emerge in Human that what is right and wrong till then Human will keep doing mistakes.
As an example a thief when goes to steal if he at that time gets this thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse, there is also punishment in it and he fears from God then that Human will not steal.
Same like this that unless Israel do not gets this apprehension that i am doing wrong and draining blood of innocents and i will get punishment for this, he will keep playing Holi with the blood innocents of Gaza till then.
Respects!
Question is that is war, armed movement, terrorism is solution to problems?
If not then what is the specific prescription which takes to the solution of the problems?
It is right that the war is the way that does not solve the problem but make it more difficult.
Falastin,Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the way which adopted Nalis Mandaila in South Africa to make their movements success.
That mean there should be behaver and politics efforts in more then force.
The participating of Kashmirian public in election tells that they accepted this view.
The third week is continue of Israel attacks on Ghaza and dead persons are about 1000.
The war could not stopped until this time with world ambassador efforts.
And according to a guess 9000 Falatinis have been left their homes and gone to save places after the attacks  starting in December.
And here helpful institutions blamed Israel that he did not care the Falastini children and there will be one total posterity in hard mental and emotional problems.
What do you say?
Is it should be?
How is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Give Taliban a Chance.
Basit, Peshawar
Wake up! If Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down girls schools?
And kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
These Taliban has damaged Islam so much that no other nation or religion has done.
Pashtoon Rore
Kohat, Pakistan
if the whole Muslim world just give a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see that how upset will its father America be.
and immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well.
but what can be done, where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from.
someone tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step as he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
the responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on Arabs and the Muslim world but its and obligation on the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny.
this unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
Just like in Pakistan and India before 30th June or the end of the fiscal year, the government institutions are looted, the American regime just before its end have given a green signal to Israel to do what ever it wants.
On the one hand, America says that a ceasefire will be attempted.
On the other hand, the United Nations is accepting petitions and more petitions, but in reality it's nothing. This means only one thing, that even the United Nations is in on the conspiracy against muslims.
All Muslim nations should disregard the United Nations, and unite under their own weight.
We have a lot of examples in front of us. Where America and United Nations are only passing petitions, the Muslims are bearing the brunt of it.
What is the advantage of these actions when BBC does not have to print anything.
Now, where have the principles of general ism been buried,When the unrequired blood especially of the Muslims starts flowing, at that time the ghost of unbiased reporting starts riding over the BBC.
Otherwise portrays itself as flag bearer of righteousness.
Saying something from their side is a far away thing, they do not want even comments
from the Muslims.
The difference between you and Jews is that they call themselves Jews and Martyr the Muslims and people like you live among Muslims, by calling themselves Muslims, to Muslims
[syja786]
For a long time on BBC forums, sometimes suicide bombing and other times terrorism in India was used to target a certain sect.
The favorite word of these Anti-Islamic discussions was Extremism.
You can get a very good idea, about who an extremist is, from the above discussion in which, writing against Iran was almost considered blasphemy.
When will our muslims understand that Anti Christ can not be fought with swords.
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what shall one do other than crying?
But the basic fault is of this turmoil and massacre which by naming Jihad, we try to blacken the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of Palestinians accepted the existence of Israel then why did Hammas need to fire those rockets on Israel and made suicide attacks?
Attitude of the both the sides is against humanity.
The role of UN and the USA was again seen as favoring towards the injustice of Israel.
May Allah give muslim nation the understanding of becoming  united. Ameen!
As a matter of fact,think about giving Noble Prise to terrorists for carrying out this painful terrorist activity, as a campaign against terrorism, eventually the actual work is being done by them.
Otherwise, is it possible to carryout terrorist activity on such a massive scale without the assistance of Chiefs and  every one knows who are pulling their strings.
In such a situation it can be termed as high handedness "Do what ever you can".
The strong mans fist,it beats over the head and do not let one cry.
The Arab rulers are giving medicines for the injured,Funeral clothing's for the dead and money and they are asking
should the Israelis continue attacks?
The actual problem is that the rulers of Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia are dreaming undutiful while asleep,Neither they have army nor they have defence plans,they just think that by providing aid they have done their duty.
They should immediately take practical steps against the Israel
like cutting of oil supply to European countries and America, but sorry for them.
Greetings to all brothers and sisters!
In my opinion, telling Hamas to quit in the name of peace now, would be an injustice to thousands of widows and orphans.
If the Israelites and their supporters are at a rise, then soon Moses shall be born, as this is the law of nature. America and Israel work as gunpowder amongst suicide bombers in Muslims.
The power drunk elephants do not understand this.
Abu Abdulla: Pakistan.
Now hammas and israel should befriended to stop blood shed.
Muhammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France.
very rightly said.
Assumingly if hammas is 100% right and by fighting against malice it gets higher place in the eyes of God even then atleast they should realize if by good deeds peace of others home is shattered then that act is no longer a good deed.
those who claim to love God, His Prophet(P.B.U.H) and their religion, to love humanity is part of their belief.
consequently after muslims confiscation of everybody on earth is Allah's order.
Najeeb-ur-Rahman Psycho *Lahore* [Pakian]
No! It is not decreed to annihilate but it is decreed to invite people to Islam.
But people who do conspiracies against the religion, it is decreed to do Jihad against them.
One should fight with them until they finish their conspiracies. But this certainly does not mean that they can wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the consequence of a murderer of children is disaster.
But its a request to my friends that yesterday Israelis did not have a roof over their heads and today they are so strong that they do not listen to anyone because all Jews are one.
They do not have Shiite nor Sunni, all are just Jews. And they have succeeded in every field and made everything.
Opposite to this, what is the condition of 55 Islamic Countries?
Lagging in every field and now the condition is this that they are so helpless that enemies are killing them and they are waiting for their death.
Point required is that all Muslim countries should get together and should make a plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better course of action than accepting Israel. Learn new technology and ways of success from them and let the world live in peace.
Muslims have great land and resources.
The need is correct usage.
First of all, the most tragic part is that Hammas and Alfatah could not be united.
The only reason to destroy great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin was to weaken the only nation fighting for Aqsa Mosque. And it was impossible until Yasir and Yasin were removed from the way.
The world is watching that how Palestine was falling down every second after the death of these two leaders.
And  how this lobby of jews strengthened their target by every moment.
In 1974, a Pakistani Prime minister was in such world power that he led all the muslim leaders under one roof with 100% attendance first time in the history.
Today, on his 81st birthday, is it hard for this nation to make a promise that whether it will unite itself or not.
also, while eradicating the differences between other Muslims,  its (The formation of Islamic common wealth) mission will be carried forward
its a monster that has gripped Palestine for half a century.
this monster has many faces.
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
and its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
this monster is most unhappy with Islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through Islam, Muslims, the perfect religion of Muslim and Practical Islam as the history tells that Islam has put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since 27th of December.
more that 3 hundred Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
after the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
however the Israeli authorities say that they will continue operation in Gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
in your opinion, is this claim of Israel true that it's doing all this for defending the sovereignty of Israel?
is the world community playing its role in such situation?
does this aggression has an indirect relation with the coming elections in Israel?
can any improvement be expected in the situation in Middle East after the succession of the newly elected American president Barak Obama.

after all a neutral impression is to be maintained.

Zaheer Chughtai
in this art now a days the Pakistani electronic and print media, specially some Urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone, who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the "grudge of Muavia" written on them.
has said that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. how long this hypocrisy will continue.
Why there is so much atrocity on Muslims. If people like America leave backing up of Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So if Americans you have courage then leave backing up of them and see then their fate of life.
All these world renowned leaders and people who murder innocents in the name of peace should realize that peace in the world can only be achieved by justice, and not through injustice or wiping entire races.
If killing a particular race off completely is the answer, then Hitler's plan would not have seen any jews survive, and definitely not seen their rise.
Says a poet
Injustice is injustice. If it breeds, it dies.
Blood is blood. If it bleeds, it dries.
How can anyone define terrorism?
Isn't all this terrorism too? Why does only ones pain seem painful?
Aren't other people human too? So why is only Muslim blood so important? Wasn't all the innocent people's blood red too?
So why are there no disapproval messages now?
I watched the Mumbai attacks investigations like the fire was in my own home. I cannot watch this human suffering. Can't everyone else see this suffering? I wish Muslims all over could come together and think about this.
Dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood, how shall we condemn, I can not find words!
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims that on one side people are being killed in India so the rest of the world comes over Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations otherwise we will do it ourselves!
And on the other side, Israel is killing generations of muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent. This is unbearable!
There is delay but not NEVER in the house of God and only then will this darkness shed. Then
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Considering elections, the rulers should do such activities for people's support. There is no doubt in this specially when countries like Israel exist. Rest talking about Barrack Obama, then history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy and nor will do it. Regime, whether black or white, is a regime.
The debate going on in the forum makes it clear that every one is sad on Benazir's death but as a politician, one can not ignore her mistakes.
This talk requires debate that whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was so dear then  why was it left in 10 year dictatorship of Musharaf until American clearance and the deal.
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the stratocracised public needed her, unfortunately she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised.
No one is going to say anything about the way that this historical figure is being falsely accused.
Sana Khan.
Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them.
One more writer.
Sir/Madam, maybe if you read not only the history of Pakistan, but of it's neighboring four countries, or of seven other countries, then you might understand the meaning of Mr. Psycho.
Tariq Abbas
One whose nature is wrong cannot be taught.
For reflection in water is not always clear.
Britain never let them become one, and invented the hindu-muslim friction which was taken ahead by sir Syed.
Psycho.
So relentless is our nation, that they are blind when writing poetry for their parties, but no one says anything when our historical figures are battered and falsely accused.
We have progressed enough.
Sana Khan.
Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey doesn't become a scholar if you put books on him.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks but Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.
If they talk about war then both the sides will suffer human loss.
India says that Pakistani citizen is caught in Bombay attacks. And he has written and sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. But earlier, when India caught this extremist, said that he is a smart engineer but later they declared him to have studied only four grades. This is what has to be considered.
First of all, merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and  all christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
we do not want the flames of fire but flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
will war give solution to problems.
it will bless with fire and blood.
will give hunger and exigence.
therefore wise humans
its better to avoid war
in yours and ours yards
its better that the glim keeps lightened
the India-America relations have deepened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
this is also the old history of America.
in case of and Indian attack, America would get its goals and the expense would be on India as well.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation and ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
this is the Islamic history.
even before this resolution the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it more clever that effected and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has relaxed its pressure now.
while ignoring India's unnecessary bobbery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a "Side Effect" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
there are no two opinions over this that it is a heinous act.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past one year?
Thousands are killed every day, the number of the mortar shells and battery, the number is very uneasy for Taliban .
The ISI, I appeal to the Taliban that only thing and we will give tutelage heaven Benazir Swat to the peace.
And the fake operation.
The day is not far when in UN resolution of Army intrusion in Pakistan will be approved just like the one against Jamat Aldawa.
Riaz Ahmed Farooqi
First our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in UN,
and suppose if this resolution took time to approve then considering the example of America any country will launch the attack at her own.
The Israeli army samiullah adverse, and we achievements and not the information sargarmiya.
A few minutes later he was not revolutionary.
The way kamaridche gawera , nawab akber khan Bugti, Dr.najeebullah  and thousands of protestors bodies were disrespected by the hands of enemies.
They are deathless even after being dead.
But here an international game is being played. Here ferrocity and animosity is created to do the ruling.
So there can be reason created that if we are not here then these vandals and animals can come take over the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
America sees the torture of these extremists but instead of being sad on these faithless activities, they easily name them as tribal culture.
The reason for these faithless activities, sometimes given in the name of tribal culture and other times in the name of Islam, is not something done by a person with a heart.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so brave that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also men of God and so is our army.
It is very clear that there is fishy.
instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and lesson gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell,
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Who burnt the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on the refusal of oath after the Prophet (PBUH) passed away and how took her husband by the rope in his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
Was the attack on Medina by the the Army of Yazid and and the incident of Karbala was the conspiracy of Jews and Pagans?
Without accepting the facts, neither motives can be removed nor these can be corrected?
BBC people, stop this dual policy.
The better super hit title than this is:  the beating  of Bush with shoes is right or wrong?
this should have been the topic.
Tahir Chowdary, Japan
Be ashamed, the body of a person was taken out of the grave and hanged on a pole because he spoke against the cruelty and you are struck up over the topic of Box Office.
The success of operation Sherdil and across the border the success of operation Lion Heart depends on the direction of sympathies of common folk.
This step is of American and Pakistani intelligence agencies and Pir Sahib is the victim of this conspiracy
All the comments on this forum would be against the Taliban because intelligence agents have successfully infiltrated in the Taliban ranks and they are carrying out such actions that can change their perception of people.
i have only the question all the day that what will the force doing when the dead body was hanging the hole day,are they sitting in country to kill the normal people those say like this two children and thier mother dead by bombing on Taliban houses.
Were they not know about that chowk?
Or they were seeing a film action?
We say it with excuse that stop this game for Allah sake.
At last there is a commander upon you also.
A question raised from BBS if it is not reasonable but alas on the sow thinking of writers,.for example it was asked from any person that for what purpose the force went Swaaat containing 30000 persons.
That the dead bodies of the helpers of force fighting with Taliban remained hanged on poles all the day.
What did the Pakistani force with Swati public what did but the media contain BBC did the world unknowing about real matter and it was not good.
Pakistani force is making drama.
Every child of Swaat is saying that this is a blood drama.
Please stop this drama, for god sake
The Taliban has destroyed the name of muslims
if the pure muslims of whole worlds does tell them as a muslim, they wont get any place to leave for the terror
Those are not interested in doing work, and not interested in leaving a peaceful life, and they take guns and join those people
Islam has not came under the pressure of gun or sword
Shame on you
there is no reason for this in any religion or in any families
BBC along with other media's has gathered information about Taliban
but, the reality is not even known to any one, that what is the real situation, we only know because we are tribals
BAsically it is a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD, and our ISI,are involved, there is no one in from taliban or from tribal, the was created by terror from above agencies, who are insulting Taliban, Islam, Madarsa's, Pestos, and Tribals
This move has ashamed all the Muslims.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that current leadership will end this  cancer.
After Mumbai attacks India said that few extremist groups are involved in these attacks.
Pakistan denied these blames and said that she will fully cooperate in the investigation.
India said that she has provided Pakistan a list of 20 extremists, who are wanted to India.
Noe Pakistan said that leader of Jaish e Muhammad Maulana Masud Azhar present in this list is not detained and Government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before this President Asif Ali Zardari has denied the impression that Western Secret Agencies and Indian Government have provided Pakistan the proves of Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said about Ajmal Qasab that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
During this, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that the its relations with India are not going to improve until its land is continued to be used for terrorism.
And in latest development, Indian Cricket team has cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should sports be effected due to these political events?
What future to you see of India Pakistan Relationship?
Pakistan will not be torn apart by America or India.
It will be torn apart by Pakistani themselves.
What can you expect after so much internal segregation and rivalry?
However, Jinnah didn't do well with the Muslims from India, and time has already proven that.
Yasmin: Chicago.
Madam, if Jinnah's work was carried forward, then these internal cancer of segregation and rivalry would not have spread, and the muslims in India wouldn't be in the situation they are in now.
It's our fault that after him, no other leader could stand in his shoes.
But if we can't appreciate our heroes, then....
This sector does have a lot of abilities.
God knows when they will come to their senses and use the blessing of unity to make some progress.
Both countries have priests, Shiv sena, RSS etc. that constantly oppose peace.
And these negative forces do not want the sector to make any progress, hence the countries are kept on their toes.
Can you imagine the status of this place in the world for Pakistan, India and China, with just a little bit of unity?
Pakistan is cursed by God for having robbers and thieves as their appointed leaders.
may Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
but Sir, open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
moreover, the internal affairs don't seem to be good, as you can see the circumstances in NWFP, Balochistan and in Karachi in Sindh.
in this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
O Allah bestow your mercy upon us.
I think a last war is the only option.
That's it, enough is enough.
This situation is ""now or never"".
These false acts of cooperation will not solve the problem.
Nor will small terrorist attacks in each others countries.
Afterall, even Europe was founded after the last world war.
And if there had not been a great war, then they would still be fighting back and forth like Pakistan and India.
Almost all of our political parties agree on this matter that these terrorist and denominational activities should be terminated from the country.
But our army rule does not seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, American and Europe are made to believe that we are with you on this war against terrorism and the other hand, we also help Taliban secretly.
We have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way. Thank you.
There is no doubt that the majority of the movement league are from the Tayaba Group, who joined the league after the inception of Pakistan.
However, after that,  this leagues obstructed aid campaigns, and now on India's insistence, United Nations has declared them as the enemy and even the Government of Pakistan is cracking down on them.
In my opinion, if these Jihadi groups quit this religious fanaticism, and try helping instead, then it would be better for all.
Terrorist groups present in Pakistan, who support professional criminals and the heads of those Mullahs are those who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.
And now they are doing everything to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called Human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan from these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous or not?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose work is only to kill.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What kind of world is this where it is hard to live for one who takes the name of one major pillar of Islam,  religion of Allah.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims but when Muslims even try to take revenge, all our hypocrite leaders together with all the non-muslim world treat people with the true and right pain of religion just like our great leader Hafiz Saeed is being treated today.
India in impunity of Bombay attacks.
Pakistan relation are bitter. Better relationship as a result of last few years between the two countries have been jolted  greatly.
India has always held the military and non-military groups in Pakistan responsible.
And bringing relationship back on track is being conditioned by operations against these groups.
For as much, Indian security departments have held Lashkher-e-Tayyaba responsible for the Bombay attacks.
In this case, name of Jamat-ud-Dawa has come in the front many times.
This is the first time that relation between both the countries have worsen due to a terrorist activity in India
In December 2001, after the attacks on Indian Parliament, these two neighbors were on the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
Now Jamat-ud-Dawa, about which Security analysts say that it is in reality a new face of Lashker-e-Tayyaba. Restrictions on the party are being requested.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan do decisive operations against extreme activists on its land?
By banning Jamat-ud-Dawa, can  current Pak-India crisis be over?
crisis be over? and how important is it to close down the armed groups to keep constant peace between both countries?
Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly?
Will the Peace Council never show any alertness against the Muslims every time?
For this it is said that when the accuser is lazy the witness is active.
If seen India itself has become one useless realm.
Whose intelligence, army and other security officials has become useless, who for 72 hours have danced the dance of mole with terrorists and India is cheating the world by blaming Pakistan over its uselessness.
If one disbeliever dies then the whole world knows about it- why is this double accuracy?
To the dear nation of one nonpolitical, religious, farming organization...
Farqaan Farooq, Faisalabad
Until our Prophet(Peace be upon Him), great ancestors and Sufism gave the human beings the love and respect, religion Islam was more vast growing and ripening from peace and sparkle.
The Muslims also got promoted in every field.
But when this beautiful Religion rose to the hands of distillation then within the human beings began the difference of religious and disbeliever and the new gateways of pride and prejudice began to open by which the world was unknown before.
Salam- Please do it with pleasure but act at your own.
do not do it under American pressure.
if India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
And why it accuses us of every thing?
there are extremist groups and organizations in India as well, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the world?
What India is doing in Kashmir, what is that?
What Israel is doing, what is that?
the truth is; we are the first Nuclear Muslim State and why; this is the main issue.
Pakistan is now in it's last stages.
Kamran Hassan: Abu Dhabi
Your words touch the heart, and the situation seems so.
Now in American publications, the new map of Pakistan is being printed, and all these restrictions are now apparent in the series of events.
The Americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over Pakistan.
In this situation, if we do not stand together and show our unity, then remember, if Bangladesh can be made, then anything can happen.
More the terrorism is condemned lessor it is , whether it is in a Hotel at Mumbai or it is in Marriott Hotel Islamabad or it is in Palestine.
Like wise irrespective of the origin of the terrorist, these should be eliminated, no matter these are Pakistanis or Indian or American or Israelite.
Now the question is that why the whole world including the Pakistani officials are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack carried out on Marriott Hotel was not a terrorist attack?
Then why?
Praise the worthy Advisor interior,Mister Rehman Malik,by the grace of God, how brave he has become!

Not only this , according to the BBC Mister Malik has also tried to negate this impression with full strength that all these imprisonments are being carried out on whose orders.
Praise the lord!
Having this capability or not, this I don't want to say.
Whose war we Pakistanis are fighting
and why. We have our own priorities which we shall protect with our full strength.
Nobody has an authority to interfere in any other country.
Apparently colonial period does not seem to exist.
If people expect justice, or demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan, which I think is not acceptable by those calling for unity.
Pakistan is always following European and American purposes.
This goes on without the approval of many of its citizens.
And it invokes hostile sentiments.
If you believe in the United States of America, then why not just give up your place and leave honorably?
Pakistan has the ability to be armed or unarmed.
Security forces raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
Pressure is being increased on Pakistan for taking rapid action against extremist organizations after Mumbai attacks.
India blames Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Secretary Condolisa Rice asked Pakistani leadership to take practical measures for instant and transparent action against the responsible s of Mumbai attacks.
She says that no doubt the extremists responsible for Mumbai attacks used Pakistani soil.
During this Peshawar Government says that unknown armed persons has set another truck stand for supply of goods to Allied Forces deployed in Afghanistan on fire, due to which more then fifty vehicles are destroyed.
It is the second attack on Neto and American supplies during 48 hours in Peshawar.
During this Pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from Karachi to Tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action.
It is revealed that during the reign of General Zia ul Huq because of the invasion of the ex USSR in Afghanistan and its resistance started by the American and Saudi funding resulted in the birth of armed groups of which Pakistan unable to terminated could not get back herself to the era before 1980s.
The question is does Pakistan want to do it?
Is Pakistan capable of doing this?
What do you think?

I ask only one question from flag holders of humanity.
If you kill their children and they bring necklace for you, this is impossible.
Saeed, Multan.
And question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies, say any logic, argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men, laborers and poor workers of different occupations, in revenge of American attack?
If answer is in no then you have instant need of correcting your point of view.
People were armed, at that time their was a danger that Russia will turn toward Pakistan after Afghanistan, therefore people were armed.
Now when there is danger that America will overrun Pakistan through passage of Afghanistan of which American president had said out in his election campaign then why should we unarm these people?
Only because America or India army don't have to face any civil resistance after defeating Pakistani army?
Yes, if anyone of them is involved in any destructive actions then Pakistan should act against them.
but this is morn, that government against Lashkaray Taiba  that prove right India that Pakistan involve in that.
Najeeb Ul Rehman Saico, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
if accept that Laskaray Taiba involve that still it is wrong to blame Pakistani government.
and one question is also that this terrorist have a either get support of any Government or Indian government personal?
is terrorist only born and made in Pakistan and not made in India and rest of the countries?
As for as Lashkr e Taiba is concerned ongoing terrorism is not linked to it.
It must be recalled that Hafiz Saeed was the first 'Militant Leader' who declared activities of Taliban 'revolt'.
I am quite sure that Taliban agitation is a vital part of American plans so every person or organization must be eliminated who challenges Taliban in any aspect.
Despite the cooperation of the whole nation action against Lashkr due to the pressure of India indicates the nervousness and flatterness of Zardari and Co.
To terminate the expedition started by the American and Saudi funding, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society.
One should also protest against them that according to what ethics, America and Saudi Arabia distributed dangerous weapons and named Jihadis but in the reality spread the virus of hateful literature and culture. Due to which slaughter houses were open in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly. And tried its best that India should attack Pakistan.
This shattered the confidence of America in the area.
Although India did not even threatened nor it has the guts to.
And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of Taliban or American posts.
Thus it was proven that without the support of Pakistan and its army, America can not do anything.
Karachi is Pakistan's business and economic center and Dubai of the less privileged areas.
Hundreds of thousands do not return empty handed from here. But since the law was enforced on the western borders, Karachi has taken all the attention.
Now they are looking to kidnap this city.
For the first time Pathan's are called Pashtoons. They are made to fight by making them strangers to each other. Although the need is to be united.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speaking learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu, or its better that everybody learns English.
You must be thinking its a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
that the cause of the torture would be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir in my childhood I had actually given the same suggestion many times to my friends ,which included people from every religion and rhetoric groups, but my friend people used to laugh over these suggestions.
at that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not that live and powerful but they were boiling inside.
its hard to understand that what is happening and why?
are these the signs of the judgement day?
what are these innocent and innoxious people being killed for?
the reason is in front of everyone, ones who want to break Pakistan into pieces are active and those who do all this neither belong to any religion nor a country.
Whether it is Karachi or Bombay, our homes are burnt with their own lamps( we  have destroyed our homes ourselves)
When the government comes, they just change names of the places to build a name for themselves. Just like these days airports, roads, buildings are all named Benazir.
What has happened in Karachi, is this what Benazir means?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awaken sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
Where reaction full of patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties have taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time they have also given American planners one more chance to think.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the turmoil in Karachi and management is showing self interest.
Management can control the situation in 1 hour but it is being given wind on purpose.
Pressure of political parties on police and rangers keeps them from doing the operation.
Talks of getting united are only limited to statements, political parties should let go of their self interests and work for the interest of a common man.
These kinds of situations will happen until political pressure stays on the management. Allah keep Pakistan safe.
In my opinion, they are the biggest terrorists.
And of course there are external powers active in this. But no one knows who they are?
But what is sad the most is if this kind of situation occurred in some city of Sarhad, government would have done what not but now when it is not in Sarhad, the government is so helpless.
Government should do an operation here and save country's big and an important city.
Otherwise, Pakistan will face a big economic setback.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth being scared. On the other hand Pakistan's media's condition is even worse.
The complete truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is this that Urdu speaking people should learn Pashto or Pashto speaking people should learn Urdu or it is even better if everyone learns English.
You will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but don't you think the reason for collision is ridiculous?
that language is the reason of violence?
There was another story of cruelness recorded in Karachi, terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
Wherever one could do something, he did everything. Reports on the media are 50% of what has happened here in four days.
Stayed awake in the last four nights and still afraid.
Who evacuated hotels, killed cobblers peanut sellers.
causing depredation on Super highway and cutting off ears of the innocents are all not aware of the punishment of Allah, which will catch them one day.
In your opinion, what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
Placing in front of us the heart struck attacks of Bombay, we certainly do not have to dive to find the reasons for this disturbance in Karachi. But there is one simple and easy reason that this disturbance was the result of spilling of blood subconsciously.
It is evident that if some one will knock kneed with the father, it is not unusual for the son to get out of control.
the blood of the loyalists of Liaqat Ali Khan also belonged to the same place but to eliminate Mr. Psycho's misunderstanding I am writing this verse.
we will also repeat our elders' traditions
we made it by sacrificing lives and will save it by doing the same
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
it is very disappointing that whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
see Liaqat Ali Khan, you will will find out that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family from Karnal in Punjab.
due to his steps for the migrants, today the migrants consider him as one of them.
there is always a reaction to every action.
one can afford on oneself but.
Ejaz Aiwan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan, they did not face any reaction.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
One Muslim League N was left, even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q have made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment in the National Assembly and the Senate.
Till now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why  no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part that is they will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft, government speaker did not take any action.
MQM the government, Muslim League N in the opposition and Muslim League Q was the party who passed 17th amendment so how is it possible that these parties will be sincere in finishing the 17th amendment.
This is what is called getting credit for nothing.
People's party is already not in a hurry about finishing 17th amendment.
How can someone think of cutting their own hands?
17th amendment will not be canceled until Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of the majority in our survey and it is also true.
If 17th amendment was to be discarded then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf. Because with being the president, he is also the chairman of the People's Party.
17th amendment is valid until he is the president.
In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to bid Zardari farewell from the president house.
neither MQM wants this nor other parties.
Most elders of our family belonged to labor class.
And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.
To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.
Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.
From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.
But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.
We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.
It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God
This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.
It was not even 30 minutes for us working that our younger son said “Dad it feels like I am not born for this job.
We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.
Son started saying that I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work .
Three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home.
What it means is that when a man decides the destination no matter what were the motives behind this no one can stop him from getting it.
But if you don’t even know what you have to do then God be with you.
It is said that do not say bad about the dead. But what shall we do, we see only bad things in Benazir even on her first death anniversary.
Benazir, for her selfish purpose, crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs after giving the list of their names who were fighting for freedom on one hand and on the other gave India the chance to keep its full attention on Kashmir after them helping to suppress Punjab Movement.
Tug of war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history, which has pushed the country back many years.
Benazir continued to give negative comments on Kashmir and the nuclear program after being exiled.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
during her rule, Benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make as much money that is why he is known as Mr. Ten percent.
during Benazir's rule his brother got killed but his murderers are still safe from any punishment.
besides being a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
just like Benazir did her politics over her fathers dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came into power twice but she could not punish her the culprits of her father's political murder even she couldn't register a case against them.
it has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
what should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated 16th December as a didactic day and take such measures that this kind of incident don't take place again.
on this day we could send greeting to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again.
the rulers would reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Bahari's stuck in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines of life from the next day.
Only if East and West Pakistan could be one together just like East and West Germany was united once again.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be granted in the near future.
When it was announced in the news today that the Governor of the American State Illinois was arrested for corruption charges
and when the State Congress started getting ready to remove him from the position of the governor as soon as possible, then there is this one American companion who has a close watch on the circumstances of Pakistan, boastfully claimed to us that this is what we call democracy.
In America, even the higher level people can not transcendence the law.
And there is your country, whose president was made after he had the corruption charges dropped.
we felt our nerve of wit and said that what if a governor was arrested in America,in our Pakistan once our prime minister was arrested during the night and was hanged and the other time was exiled.
Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
Pakistan awarded guard of honor and bid farewell from the president house who broke the law of the country. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
Chief Justice of Pakistan was laid off in such a way that even after nations support, he has yet not reinstated. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
In Pakistan, fake degree holder was appointed as health minister, Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
After listening to this, poor American could not stop laughing and also accepted defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by Americans from all sides.
It seems from his smile
that America is with his government. But he is forgetting that last year the same people was with Parvez Musharaf.
This picture has been taken as it was a family gathering
A photo like this was never published in the papers before; one president with three American officials.
It seems the American involvement in Pakistan has increased and more than one official is needed to do the job; or they are not relying on their new puppet the way they relied on the one before him.
This could also have been arranged keeping in mind the stories of President Zardari’s breach of commitments.
If it had been a sensible ruler, at least he would not have been grinning during the photo session and he would have had a subservient and embarrassing look on his face.
If the principle of democracy is applied on this picture then Present Zardari is in minority.
In democracy, majority rules the country and the picture reveals the actual rulers.
The scenic Swat valley is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
The government’s policy so far is to engage in talks besides the use of force.
But the use of force is achieving nothing other than strengthening the Taliban and increase in public sympathies for them.
what needs to be done is that the government, instead of using the power, should eliminate the causes of the issue.
by eliminating the causes Fazlullah and Taliban will automatically finish.
the Sharia bill proposed by ANP will become the solution of the problems of Swat to a great extent.
But besides implementation of the Sharia, the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues.
from the early steps of General Musharaf, it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians, but the lust of power changed all his plans.
all the hopes were from the participation in the "war of terror", he had started considering himself as immortal.
those steps which were expected, all broke-off.
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, he made a deal with the thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army but never know what's happening to the present government.
Either its Bajor or Swat, the army does not control terror but bombs the "Enemy" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy a mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy.
The conditions in the  terrorism struck area Swat in the Frontier Province are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area
On the one side the governments writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side the effect of Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everday in Swat.
On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.
The result is that on the one side the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other hand the Taliban has established their hold.
In between who got grinded, the poor citizens.
It is said that in Swat somebody asked, which type of people are the Taliban's are? The answer was  "very good people because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country".
Then asked how is Army, the answer was that the Army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.
Then it was asked, who are the enemies of religion and country, the answer was "the citizens"
I am astonished, how the Pakistan Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban's.
Could not track down Taliban's illegally operated FM channel which in my opinion is very easy.
But still FM was spreading hatred in full swing.
After girls schools now boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfew is imposed so that tablibans can move around easily.
Tonight 8 trucks entered the suburbs of Mingora during curfew and created bunkers.
The question is that how could they reach there during curfew.
Army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house and salutes Taliban.
For God sake someone tells this Army to protect helpless people of Sawat from Taliban and prove that Pakistan army can overcome any enemy.
He says, maximum bloodshed has been done on the base of religion, you tell me in the absence of any religion wont bloodshed occur?
Punjabi, Pathan. white and black, Mehsud and other tribes, are all these created by religion?
No! No way! Sir, religious is what teaches that no one is black or white, punjabi or muhajir otherwise if religion was not present, then half world would have vanished for the war between white and black and other half fighting over the status and sect.
Actually, religion gives moral teachings to the man. And binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here. And he should spent his life according to his rules.
As a muslim, I have total faith that Islam is complete way of life and a true religion.
After moving to London, I used to call my relatives back home every single morning, although they never called us even once. Then I realized they were inconvenienced by our calling as well, so we stopped.
After living in France now for two years, I feel the same way.
I don't know why people always expect us to call them.
A resolution passed about Iraq in a few hours, Darfar has absolutely no problem in sending peace army.
Bombay attacks were condemned in no time and banning dubious groups is only a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are doing consensus.
O caretakers of international peace! life is finishing here!
Is it for real that every one is waiting for its end?
So that no other victim will even think about using a great damage causing weapon like a sling shot to fight for his rights?
Doesn't your hear ache even when a father is running holding his son's dead body?
If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
But you are a shame to the name of humanity.
At least this was proven that this area was also Israel's country for thousands of years.
What should happen is that both the nations should live together happily and with love but since they are controlled by the west and arab countries, therefore peace can not be formed here with out their consent.
But even Iran wants to fight its proxy war here now.
Even if operations in Israel are stopped for the time being, they will start again after some other incident.
The interest of BBC's country is subject to the bestowing of America and Israel. And this is the reason why in the name of "enlightenment", they have come with a series of blogs based on "darkness" and doing one-way and a blind propaganda.
BBC is just doing formality and to gain sympathy is their only purpose and wish!
mr moderator is requested that he may publish the commentry by this humble soul so that one can guess BBC still has some integrity left.
Thankyou.
who knows about the author and the origin of this story but the fact remains, in every era draculas have fed on innocent blood.
Every era has seen war as well as blood shed.
surprisingly twenty first century man who considers himself very civilized is silent over this murder done publically in the day light.
how can he not realize that whatever is happening is showing the ugliest face of humanity

At this time along with Dera Ghazi Khan, in whole country winter rains are goin on.
here is a poem according to the weather, enjoy the weather along with this poem.
These rains are with your presence.
if it rains, its spring
if it stays then its peace
sometimes comes without a reason
at times spread over day and night
sometimes very noisy and sometimes very quiet
These rains are with your presence.
in a memory, at a night
to a buried ash
Sometimes we blew out the flames.
Sometimes we burnt ourselves.
Sometimes every drop is like pain.
And these rains are only because of you.
All these leaders are going to run away with their briefcases in hand, what do they care about what will happen to the country.
Let the population sell toothpaste or clean the bells of the Mandir with the peels of lemons.
And then our media is also fraudulent like our leaders.
The purpose of it is to get money out of the government, and nothing else.
And as far as the population goes they can remain stupid because talking about them would be an even bigger stupidity.
Yesterday noon strange thing happened.
All the police is running here and there but do not check illegal parking.
Moreover traffic nypd was also not in the mood to look at the illegally parked vehicles
It happened that a plane of U.S. Air Force actually became a ship and landed in Hudson River.
Till today only this much is known that the "terrorist" belonged to the family of birds called goose.
Yesterday, perhaps it was historical cold in New york.
The temperature never goes down this much.
Pain started in my own jaw, after walking outside for half an hour .
Imagine what was the condition of those persons who jumped from the plane into the the river.
The reason for happiness is that all the person were safe.
The reason for concern is that the plane of the company was drowned during the financial crisis.
While watching all this I went to New Jersey by West Side Highway. I Noticed that South Bound is blocked, still what I did?
Yes, I was jammed in it on my way back.
Thanks God,during my an hour trip the road was bit cleared as I get an exit from 56 street.
Otherwise I did not avail the first two exit due to the long lanes of vehicles.

For no reason, we thought that the Taliban group from Sawat was non religious, who were only against women education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
But like majority of the ideas, this was not proven right also. According to this news of CNN, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a Boys school with gunpowder.
In Swat,the Taliban pulled down the school of students.
The schools of girls were pulled down first in the cause of famous English school Ladies First and I do not that the people why did not consider Talibab free of crimes.
It is also known that it is wrong that Taliban are only against the education of girls.
not this but the wonderful that they are against total education.
These freedom fighters are gifted more power and the Devil
which is commanding us and he is helped to abolish it.
Amin after it Amin.
Wonderful,120 school have been pulled down yet.
The tradition of engagement before birth in Muslims,to marriage with Quran in order to control inherits and the insistence of many mufties that the girl became adult and sensible in 8 years it was not minor it is not only but in India a girl was married with a frog.
Sea the pictures pictured on the time of marriage.
just a while before this, the wedding of a dog with a girl took place.
look at that groom.
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
it is the era of computers and its involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life.
many people have many reservation over this increasing involvement of computer, for example, in financial matters.
where use of credit card bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
so now only through your financial matters like through your credit card, you can be located.
and in future when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent, its benefits will increase more and more.
similarly in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, the credit card information is stolen.
similarly computers have become the source of friendship.
, social networking websites like Orcet, Facebook and MySpace are ranked first in popularity.
But don't you feel that the more closer we are getting of these sites mentally, practically moving further away from people.
Similarly there is the website of match making, where by knowing your choice you are provided with a list of people according to your likings.
Can you spend life with your own cologne (of course not physical)?
I can't do it, that is why a life partner is known as better half.
That he/she may cover my deficiencies.
I am probably low gifted from mind.
I considered true all the talking from any elder.
And such i had assurance that my father know the answer of every question of the world.
There was laughed upon me for it.
But only that saying seemed true which could be possible.
Become much irritation because what was the reason to tell lie?
Bore loss on that saying even at this age
So it is my effort to say lie the very least.
Do not misguide someone by lieing and that also by attaching Allah's name.
and Allah willing say only when there is pray to Allah that work completes.
Remaining Allah knows better the state of intention.
This is a disgusting problem which is created due to reason of distance from religion.
According to law of both our Pakistan and religion, minor child should stay with mother.
Their expense is due to their father and father can meet with children.
Then when the kids get mature, they can live with anyone they want.
You have rightly said about the misunderstandings relatives create.
Our behavior is over taken by feudal thinking
Ever here this way of thinking is working that new co-sharers will be born in father's property and this is where the opposition is shown. Otherwise their father's this behavior is worth praise and pursuance.
With reference to relationships, these forceful affiliation has created evil in our society.
Concept of marriage of a divorced or a widow is ending.
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason family breakups.
In our society, if wife of a 50-55 year old man or husband of a woman goes to the next world and he marries again, why is he not respected?
There is a Pakistani uncle living close to us, his wife passed away around 10-12 years ago. Now after all his children got married, he married a widow, for which his kids have turned against him.
In my point of view, it is their religious right, what do you say?
"To take place of our mother in the being of our mother" what kind of thinking?
According to my thinking his sons should thik that what did he done wrong when he married with widdow after the merriage of children?
By this that widdow got a helper and he got a person to manage his home.
Because his sons and daughters engaged in their life and will not care him.
The reason behind this is ignorence.
In future what if their wives refused to work for the old man?
This is the outcome of the social pressure.
Childeren feel ashamed on the second marriage of their father when people make jokes of such family on this action.
Where as they must face the circumstances and say that what their father did,it was just according to Islam.
This is a curse in our society in which we are sunk since last 40 to 50 years.
It is acceptable for a wife that her husband does unlawful actions but she does not let him marry another woman.
If its in her power, she will not let him do so even after she dies.
Destroys her afterlife along with her husbands'.And also lets spreading of the immorality in the society.
Nothing happens with singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.
And about your question, when sir instead of bringing his wife home, goes to someone else's wife so the dependents just make a fuss for the show and stay quiet and satisfied. ( yeah, later the relatives of the wife get angry)
In the Indian subcontinent, we accepted Islam centuries ago but we could not let go of this illiterate thinking and always thought of culture and tradition as more valuable than Islam.
Considering man's 2nd marriage as ridiculous, divorce as denigration, divorced as untouchable, love marriage as dishonor and considering a man marrying an older women is dissimulation of the women is only the result of this way of thinking.
And over all, by copying the western world, we are declaring the religious and veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam was easy, getting rid of this way of thinking is very hard.
Allah bless us all the courage for it.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never that difficult.
Centuries passed in writing this little.
Consider it enough.
Allah Hafiz.
Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes that i found this secret in my life that if leader of any Army is in front line then that Army will never lose.
But here situation is else.
To say that Common people are there to die for us if we die then martyr
if someone from common people dies then murder
May Allah bless and have mercy on you.
When I was coming back to the shop after Isha prayer tonight, one man who was sitting in  car, raised his hand and asked me to come.
I thought may be this man has forgotten his way or may be he wants to ask something. I stopped so his whole family was in his car.
He asked if I can understand Arabic very well or not. I said that there is no problem. You tell me what is the matter.
He started saying, I have come from Riyadh but here some one in Medina picked my pocket if you please help me. I said forget about it.Because  this has happened with me earlier also as I gave this man 20 riyals to pay for gas and go back to Riyadh but he started doing the same thing after moving forward a little.
I got really angry and when I told him and threaten him of a cop, he vanished from there.
So now this is the condition of us Muslims that even when we come to beg money, we come with families riding in cars and daily manage to get at least 2 to 3000.
Although there is an evident saying of the Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the hand above is better than the hand below and the hand above is the giving hand the lower is the taking hand.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims ( Amen)
Wassalam

The police station suggester her to contact Court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Guladari submitted a plea against her husband that Adnan Sami tortures her continuously.
and treats her inhumanely.
Now this has exceeded her tolerance limit therefore a case should be recorded against Adnan Sami.
Police instead of recording a report suggested that she should contact the court by saying that this matter is not what comes under police control.
In your opinion, is the accusation of Adnan Sami's wife on him is correct?
What if this accusation is an attempt of tarnishing the name of Adnan Sami?
Let us know of your comments regarding this matter.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
as far as allegations are concerned, anyone can post it on someone else.

this is a consequence of his own deeds.
Washington...
top American officials say that president Obama will take strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
in the new American policy over Afghanistan, there is more emphasis on war than development.
officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achievement of American goals Since in his government, there is corruption, drugs business has increased and Taliban are regaining their power.
American officials say that people, who are putting more pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more, include vice president Joe Biden and President Obama's representative for Afhanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke.
He said that this good administration was noticed after the President Bush left, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai after every 2 weeks and used to emphasize on the role of America in Afghanistan and the development of its city departments.
Officials say that Obama management will work with the state leaders as a backup with the main government.
Officials say that they will emphasize Hamid Karzai on fighting against corruption
Hamid Karzai faces new elections this year. And it is not clear as yet that Obama and his companions will favor his presidency or not.
Is this statement, of the American officials, a forecast of change in American policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is this era of Hamid Karzai ending?
What are your thoughts in this matter?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and SriLanka, Srilanka defeated Pakistan with 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Srilanka in the first one-day match although Srilanka won in the next two matches.
In this third one-day match, the nation's team performance was very poor. They worn out in only 75 runs in 23 overs against 309 runs made by the national team of Srilanka.And this is how we faced a lesson learning defeat.
the result of the series proves that the National team has no consistency in its performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
which departments of the game should be addressed more by the authorities?
are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
which department you will hold responsible for the defeat, fielding, batting or bowling?
please provide your feedback.
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish  traditions continue. these feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule, who would call them Muslims?
a Sardar should walk himself over these embers. why the present government do not act against them?
when the judicial justice will come in handy.
Sir Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan for playing one day international series.
Visit of a foreign team to Pakistan, in spite of Pak India tension is a good sign.
On reaching Karachi Airport the Sir Lankan team was given a warm welcome.
Two matches will be held between Pakistan and Sir Lanka in Karachi while the third one will be played in Lahore.
Both teams are asserting highly regarding their batting, bowling and fielding.
If Siri Lanka venerates its spinners, Pakistan’s reliance is on its fast bowlers.
Sir Lanka’s captain Mahela Jayawardene says that no one player but the whole Pakistan cricket team is dangerous.
Muralidharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, while Pakistan’s captain says that this competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik has said “we have played Murali Dharan before and will take care of Mendis as well. We have made a secret game plan and will reveal it on the ground”.
Will the Pakistan and Sir Lanka series live up to claims of being interesting and thrilling?
Which side will dominate in the Pakistan and Siri Lanka series?
Who will win the series?
Who will be man of the series?

Gulfam, London, Publish statements that are of liking, you give preference to those too, it is our wish that even you write some truth, do not entangle the statement like Mukher Jee because it is commanded to say truth in front of tyrant and it is equal to Crusade(Jihad). What to say of Mukher Jee, change the statement between news and try to weep.

It is all these people's doing Kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years.
No, no one  asked, now they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism so they have started talking about peace and settlement.
First they generally massacred Muslims now they are perplexedly settling the matters.
In any way Pakistan has to understand their duplicitous policies.
Asad Khan: London
India is making situations so that the Kashmir situation is overlooked.
But Pakistan has always shown India's true face to the world.
Even the British government is now understanding this, that is why India is now ruining Pakistan's reputation by terrorism accusations to distract from the Kashmir situation.
And hesitates to talk with Pakistan about this.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that by resolving the issue of Kashmir will bring an end to extremism, the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
it should be clear that the newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister while talking to media in Mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Does India wants to use terrorism as a means to avoid a dialogue ?
Let us know about you opinion
Usman Aftab.
I think Super powers don't want to destroy Pakistan
rather they are thinking of certain policies to control her they are familiar that Pakistan is an atomic power
want to bring some sort of revolution
Foreign countries believe that by cornering Pakistan few hurdles may generate want to support Pakistan and also wish to achieve their goal
A citizen,USA
Hindus always hit hard and then start speaking sweet.
I think that they get problems often in a while and they start threatning Pakistan.
We are ready from each aspect.Indian army chief should better shut his mouth up else we are capable to cross attacking.
Faheem Siddiqi
Ras al Khaima, This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is in how deep waters.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers movement not played any role?
What you want say about the words of the Prime minister

It is extremely sad that the Israelis are openly killing Palestinians. Over here, Kashmir is in the same situation but the Peace Council does not even turn a ear over it.
All the groups that are in Kashmir and Palestine, should keep the war going for freedom, and unitedly fight any force that opposes them. One day their martyrdom will bear fruit, God willing.
Israeli air attacks are still continued on Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
The important leader of Hamas Nazaar Rayyan and family has been martyred.
The Security Council session ended without any decision.
America has opposed the censure resolution against Israel submitted by Lebia and other Arab countries in the session.
Israeli airplanes bombardment is continued since many days on Palestinian civil population.
The whole world reacted on Mumbai attacks but no country including America and England can see bloodshed caused by Israeli attacks.
Why the major countries of Muslim world are silent?
What will you wish to say on this double standard of the world.

I think that actually, most of our people are illiterate. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties, the electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The crisis of electricity and gas has worsen in whole of the Pakistan
, on the other hand gas prices have been raised by average 8, while in few cities unavailability of petrol created immense worry for people.
Intense reactions, riots and torturous demonstration are continued in the industrial and business circles of Pakistan against the crisis of electricity and gas.
Industrialists have threatened a shutdown ultimatum.
In Karachi people are worried due to 8 to 10 hours load shedding.
Industrial sector is almost paralyzed.
Government Institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other.
Increasing the prices of electricity and gas is not a joke with people?
Why the solutions of the problems are not considered?
Is government not seeing the full stop on national development?
What steps you will instantly recommend for managing this crisis?

after ruling America for 8 years, president Bush has departed from the White House and shifted to the president camp office in Camp David so that the White House can be renovated according to the new president Barak Obama's likings.
During Bush's eight years rule, the historical attacks and destruction of the World Trade Center, attack on Pentagon and then in the name of war against terror, attacking Afghanistan and Iraq and involving forces from other countries into the war and use of American resources in it have become memorable examples of his time.
due to this war America itself faced the worst ever economical and financial crisis in history.

the Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian Cricket Team had to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20 twenty on Pakistan Tour.
The Vice-President of the Indian Cricket Board Rajeev Shukla who spoke to the news said that the board has asked the Government to allow the Pakistan Tour but because of the serious matters between the two countries this tour is not possible.
Is it right to use available political issue of the Indian government as the passport to cancel the cricket tour, the games must not be kept away from politics?
Isn't the decision of the Indian Government towards cricket a loss?
Even though the security in India was poor, the English Cricket Team tour was going on, so why don't the Indian team do the Pakistan Tour?
What is your opinion in this regard?
Salman, Karachi.
People who feel proud on going to India.
And their films and videos which are made there, now their eyes must open to see that how much the Indian people respect you.
I remember one interview of Adnan Samee where he said I am not a Pakistani, my popularity is British.
Adnan Sami should return to Pakistan first chance he gets because respect did not suit you there either.

Indian's attitude has changed after Bombay Attacks.
Jagjit Singh has showed his reaction in this way that he hates Pakistan and Pakistani.
One should know that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsley. How is he a bad singer now? Adnan Sami Should stay in India, there is not need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshaad Alam
Karachi, On the statement of Jagjit Singh, I would only say that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Bombay incident, there hateful statements have increased. The same people are now saying evil against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
according to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said "You dog this is a farewell kiss"
after that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards Bush. president Bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself.
second shoe hit the American Flag.
Security personnels dragged the journalist away from there.
at this point, president Bush said that he didn't know why he had done so , Shoe was of number 10, I had no problem.
do you think this reaction of the journalist wasn't an expression of deprecation or President bush from the Iraqi people?
what would you say on this incident?
The tension between Pakistan and India's relations after the terrorism in Mumbai got further intense when the fighter planes from the Indian Air force violated the Pakistani airspace in Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
as a result of retaliation from Pak Air force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
sources say that both Indian planes were loaded with ammunition.
This is the first of its kind incident in the current tensed situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that Air Force is all set for country's air defense.
Information Minister Sherry Rahman says that Indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed. Although, this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
In your opinion, does India really have an intention of air strike on Pakistan?
Is this statement of India correct that this violation was a mistake or this was to find out the ability of Pakistan Air force.
Is this incident not going to aggravate the current estrangement among the two countries?

Its true that they were killed but we feel sorry that they killed many innocent people in Karachi,at which they feel proud that Naseer Ullah Baber did a good job
But later,changed at all.
But it's also true that they ignored the seniors of their party and nominated their own son as the representative of People's Party.What sort of democracy is it?
Jimmy Noor,Karachi,This news has proved Quran's statement that a non Muslim will actually help an other non Muslim.
But if the iron axe doesnt contains the handle,it can' cut any thing.
Our leaders own these styles,they are adopting secret ways,that's why our country is suffering with hardships.
May Allah Almighty show the right path to our leaders.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations have included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed as well as two other Pakistani citizens and that of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organisations into the list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaidah and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, practically non-existent organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba Operation Chief, Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organisations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organisations, they will be restricted from traveling and will be under arrest.
They will have to face cases.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India blaming these parties for the Bombay attacks without any proof?
Aren't there any terrorist groups in India?
Are International groups not aware of the tortures being done on the minorities in India?

Karachi, our leaders should understand this that people, they are doing the operation against, are the true valuers of Pakistan, who are tolerating all kinds of tortures but they love Pakistan.
If there would be war then they will fight for Pakistan.
When their love would be felt, just condenming politics will not work. I think between both, there might be going a resulting war.
