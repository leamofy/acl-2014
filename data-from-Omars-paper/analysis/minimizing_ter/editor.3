Avoid dieting..Prevent flu.
American scientists found this to be true from experimenting on mice.
Results proved that mice on a lower calorie diet had comparatively less ability to fight the flu virus.
Research disproved the old axiom, "It is better to fast during a fever".
According to scientists, one should eat during a fever.
Researchers at The Michigan State University said that mice, who were fed a lower calorie diet had less ability to fight flu symptoms than their counterparts who were eating a normal diet.  Studies also showed that their chances of death from the flu virus also increased.  Mice eating a normal diet had the strength to fight off the virus and live a longer life.
According to Professor Elizabeth Gardner, people who diet will not be affected with the flu sooner but they will require more time to recover from it.
She added that people who have received the flu vaccine should avoid dieting during the winter months.
'First Nuclear Experiment - 1990'
The books is authored by Americans Thomas Reed, a former weapon designer at the Lever National Laboratory, and Danny Stillman, the former director of technical intelligence at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
The book is titled 'Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation.' The authors claim that the first country to make a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets or had the support of another country.
in an interview with US news, Thomas Reed said that in 1990, during the rule of Benazir Bhutto, China texted Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Thomas Reid said that, for many reasons, he believes that China had tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
These reasons include the design of the bomb and information gleaned from talks with the Chinese scientists.
He further added that China's assistance allowed Pakistan to, in only two weeks and three days, carry out nuclear testing in response to that of India in 1998.
Thomas Reed recalled that, in 1961, Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear test. Although the U.S. had possessed the bomb for decades, it was 17 days before it conducted its own nuclear test in response.
He further said that the test of the nuclear weapon, which Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998, was made with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.
When Thomas Reeds was questioned as to whether China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he merely replied that India was a common enemy of both Pakistan and China.
He said there is proof that Doctor Abdul Qadeer Khan used Chinese design, and that documents acquired from Libia will confirm this statement.
He said that in 1990, the United States conducted nuclear tests in Nevada, and shared the results with Great Britain.
He said that Israel was given access to the results of this test.
Thomas Reed was also questioned as to whether China is continuing with its nuclear testing program.
Thomas Reed said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions, and design to a nuclear facility in Isfahan, Iran, since 1990.
China also provided Iran a nuclear enrichment plant.
He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen through North Korea.

Protest against the bias of journalists.
I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway in to the hall of thermonuclear destruction. I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality.
I believe that even amid today's mortar bursts and whizzing bullets, there is still hope for a brighter tomorrow. I believe that wounded justice, lying on the blood flowing streets of our nation can be lifted from this dust of shame and reign supreme among the children of men.
I have the audacity to believe that people everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits.
This faith can give us courage to face the uncertainties of the future. It will gives our tired feet new strength as we continue our forward stride toward the city of freedom.
When our days become dreary with low-hovering clouds and our nights and become darker than a thousand midnights, we will know that we are living in the creative turmoil of a genuine civilization.
With the richness and variety of bird life, there are brilliant discoveries to be made by any bird watcher who has the requisite enthusiasm and perseverance.
In actual fact there is little danger from an elephant unless it happens to be a rogue or a female with a small calf.
I still believe that one day mankind will bow before the altars of god and be crowned triumphant over war and bloodshed,and non-violent redemption will be proclaimed the rule of the land. The lion and the lamb shall lie down together and every man shall sit under his own vine.
I was also asked how I could subsist on the little food I ate during my meals, and this knowledge again was obtained by watching me eat till I mustered enough courage to shut the kitchen door.
The villagers were curious about me, and strange as it may seem, I had not anticipated it. Their curiosity usually showed itself when they asked me direct question.

The 819 trillion Dollar economic reform package was was accepted and passed by the government.
No member from the Republican party voted for this plan supported by President Obama.
It was the thought of the Republican party, that this economic plan had a very expensive price tag and that it would not accomplish what it needed to.
In The House of Representatives, 240 votes were cast in favor of the plan, while 188 votes were cast against it.
This economic reform plan has to be voted on in the Senate next week, where the Democratic party has the majority.
It is feared by supports of the economic plan that due to opposition from the Republican party, it's passing in the Senate may not be as easy as it was in the House.
After the passing of the economic reform plan among the Representatives of the house, Barack Obama spoke to the members telling them that they should not let political differences get in the way of passing this important plan.
The President said that the plan, which he hoped would become law by next month would prove helpful in creating a suitable environment for jobs to grow in the country. It would also ensure that small business would prosper in the country.
According to this plan, the middle class and the small business would be relieved of 275 billion dollars of debt and 540 trillion Dollars would be given for repairing roads, bridges and schools. It would also extend unemployment benefits while allowing for research on new technologies.
The editor of BBC in Washington, Richard Lister said that Barack Obama had decided to put political differences behind his him and prepare a new political culture, but this economic stimulus package has once again created bitterness along the political lines.

Israel President and Turk Prime Minister are Bitter

Mr. Urdan has said that "I feel that you are using such words in order to hide your guilt but you have killed those children and I am mourning the death of those killed at sea side."
Shamon Perez has said that Gaza incident was not due to Israel, it was Hamas who had created a dangerous dictatorship.
Davis CA, correspondent of BBC has said that world economic forum has never seen such incident before.
Afterwards Urdan said that he respected the Israeli President and his age because of which he shouted at him but what he was saying was far from the truth.
Turkey is one of few Muslim countries which has diplomatic ties with Israel, while there is acrimony in the relations of both the countries for last few years.
Attacks were planned in Pakistan
Wajid Shams UL Hassan tells the NDTV that Pakistan will soon publish the investigative report on the Mumbai Attacks.
Last year 170 people lost their life in the Mumbai Attacks.
Now India is holding the Lashkar-i-Taiba, an extremist outfit responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
India also claimed that no state actors of Pakistan also have role in the Mumbai attacks.
Pak-India relationships are badly hurt by the Mumbai attacks.
High Commissioner Wajid Shams Ul Hassan gave a statement to the press that gives a clue what the investigative report may contain.
Wajid Shams-ul-Hassan stated that the investigative report denied that Pakistani soil has been used.
That it could be any other country but not the Great Britain.
I have thoughts about both Pakistan and Britain.
Indian and the international world put too much pressure on Pakistan to take action against those responsible for the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan said that it took action against many people who are possibly behind the Mumbai attacks and dozens of people have been arrested.
Wajid Sahms Ul Hassan said, "We are not trying to hide this."
We believe we should act based on real information.
Our investigation's results will be accepted by the world.
Through our investigations, we try to satisfy India with evidence about what happened and who is responsible.
He defended delay in the Pakistani investigation by saying that these types of clues take considerable time to be gathered, understood and investigated.
Commissioner Wajid Shams Ul Hassan said that India took 45 days to show his dossier.
Republican leaders also elected a Red Indian.
In all six stages of the Republican party election Mikel Settle won. He got 91 votes out of 168.
During the election for the position of chairman of the party, Katen Dawsen, candidate opposite to Steel, obtained 70 votes. Whereas former chairman Dunken abdicated from the competition in the second round.
People say that from the five candidates who stood for the position of the chairmanship of the Republican party, Michael Steel was considered the most conservative among them.
After his win, Michael Steel said in his speech, "We are saying to our friends and enemies together, to come with us but those who will cause problems in this, be prepared to separate from us." Michael Steel is from Maryland where he has also been the Deputy governor.
He became famous in 2006 when he stood for a seat in the Senate.
But after losing in the Senate elections, he was appointed as the chairman of one political conservative committee of the party.
Now after being selected as the chairman of the party, the efforts of the Republican party campaign in the entire country will be under his supervision.
He fought elections for the promise that he will give the party a new cause. He will also use a new technique to join conservative supporters to the party.
Indian claims presence of Lashker-e-Tayyaba and Josh-e-Muhammad in Jammu.
There is news of presence of terrorists in the Poonch Tribal area of Jammu.
According to official sources, police and army surrounded the area and started the search on receiving secret information.
During this time small fights ensued in which four militants, two soldiers and one police agent were killed.
According to sources these fights were going on until the last reports received, and Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad militants are present in these regions, to fight with whom more army battalions were sent there.
Meanwhile, the Chief Minister selected by the joint government, Umar Abdullah, met with the governor and informed him about his being selected the leader of his party, the National Conference in the assembly.
The allied party of the National Conference, the Congress also informed the governor of their support for Umar Abdullah.
Tomorrow, Umar Abdullah will be administered the oath as the Chief Minister of the State.
Note that in the recently held state elections the National Conference got 28 out of the 87 seats of the parliament, thus becoming the largest party. It should be clear that separatist groups boycotted the elections.
Congress, which got 17 seats, was prepared to form a joint government with the National Conference.
Today, upon reaching Srinagar, Umar Abdullah was jubilantly greeted by the party members.
On this occasion, Umar Abdullah said that he would try to play a role in generating dialog between the Indian government and separatists. However, this would not be possible until the elections took place and the new government came to power in India.
The role of the European Union in peace making in the Middle East.
If looked at from a government perspective, the diplomatic efforts going on to stop the Middle East War are most decisive.
According to the state policy of Brussels, the efforts of the Shwarzenburg delegation or those of Sarkozy, is similar to one giving a helping hand.
The spokesperson of the European Commission, Amadeu Altafaj, said that every effort which helps advancing the joint message of the European Union, to the two parties, is welcome.
As far as the state policy is concerned, everyone seems alright.
However, in reality, the European Union is in a sad state of internal conflict.
As the president of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is weak to start with.
On top of that, internal fighting has made it all the more difficult.
On the other hand, French President Sarkozy's demeanor suggests that he is the president of the Union.
France has completed its 6 month presidency period.
Sarkozy wants to play a presidential role, and he is able to do so, but he does not have the permission.
The most ridiculous situation faces that of the foreign minister of France, Bernard Kouchner.
He is part of the delegation, which is being headed by Schwarzenberg, foreign minister of Czech Republic.
Even worse both the foreign ministers are giving different statements on the middle east war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself, whereas according to Kouchner, this war does not come under defense policy. On the other side, Germany has also sent its special ambassador to Middle East. The European Union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues.
It's evidence is the reaction of Israel who does not pay an importance to the conciliation efforts of the EU.
EU has a golden chance of getting something done because America has lost in the Middle East due to the policies of George Bush.
Economic Setback due to the Suicide of German Billionaire Industrialist.
Adolf Meerklay, residing in the area of Sawabia in southern Germany, has  left a great business group behind him.
But earlier common German citizens did not know much about him.
Later when he had to conference about the loan given to his industrial group, with almost 30 banks for many weeks, he also became topic of the headlines. He could also see a dark future of Meerklay groups.
The Merkel Group had to suffer financial losses of many millions of Euro after its investment to buy shares in the German auto maker Volkswagen company.
Then monetary institutions canceled this groups loan amounting 700 million and another 1 billion Euro that it necessarily required. Hence the extreme pressure Merkel came into.
Some time back the bank agreed to provide Merkel Group an emergency loan. Instead Adolf Merkel who raised Merkel Group from a small to a strong industrial group whose annual income was approximately 30 billion Euro couldn't bare the loss of control in his investment capability.
Adolf Merkel started managing the business and modernize it after the death of his parents. The business under his supervision became very popular and became more strong.
He named his company Ratiopharm which is today Germany's very large acclaimed and successful pharmaceutical company.
Some time back the commercial value of this company was in between 5 and 6 billion Euro and still was earning a revenue of 8.1 billion Euro annually. After the great success of Ratiopharm the Merkel Group acquired many big businesses. Which included building material companies like Hydelberg cement to modified/special car maker Kassbohrer company.
The workforce of Merkel Group is nearly about 100,000 throughout the world and it's assets include Ratiopharm which has always been the most important business in the portfolio.
Adolf Merkel during his liftime expressed the view may a time that "" It has been four generations that we have been in pharmaceutical business.
Now the management of this institution is with my children. I hope this institution will remain for hundred's of years to be managed by and in possession of my family.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel the banks have provided approval for temporary loans of 400 million Euro for VEM Group but added the condition that VEM should sell off Ratiopharm to improve the financial situation for a long term sustainability.
Like this, after the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain the same as it was.
Crime rate among the immigrants in Germany
According to the fresh statistics, crime rate among the immigrants from 2004 to 2007 is
Reduced from 9.22%
to 4.21%
According to Joachim Herrmann, the interior minister of Baweria province, this is apparently a positive change.
He said: "It is important to note that the number of foreigners getting German citizenship is increasing."
Therefore this should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German, his background is foreign.
Herrmann said that his province will take this into account when gathering statistics in 2010.
Besides Baweria, Hamburg is also thinking within the same lines.
The internal affairs senator related with the matters of CDU, Cristoph said: ""When research is done in a scientific manner, Ahlhaus, man can not bring about its required results as it wills, but rather, it depends on the numbers and statistics that come out from the research.
Ahlhaus referred to a state-wide objective reporton crime prevention,which was prepared in 2006. The report indicated what percent of the people committing crimes from Bergdorf to Hamburg were foreigners.
From the results, it became clear that the foreigners there
had a lower crime rate than the crimes taking place in the whole state.
Contrary to this, during 2006, when the percentage of youngsters committing crimes was calculated, it became evident that the youngsters from a foreign background committing crime was 44
.7 percent.
However, the various German political parties such as SPD, environmentalist party, grains, and left wing party Linkspartei is against finding out during the collecting of crime statistics, as to which German citizen is of foreign background.

The history of civilization shows how man always has to choose between making the right or wrong use of the discoveries of science. This has never been more true than in our own age.
In a brief period amazing discoveries have been made and applied to practical purposes. It has become platitude to say we are living in an age of revolution. It would be ungrateful not to recognize how immense are the boons which science has given to mankind. It has brought within reach multitudes of benefits and advantages which, only a short time ago, were the privilege of the few. It has shown how malnutrition, hunger and disease can be overcome.
It has not only lengthened life but it has enriched its quality. Fields of knowledge, experience and recreation which in the past were open only to a select few have now been made accessible to millions.
But the gifts of modern science can be misused.
Through science, an everyday man of today has been given the opportunity of a longer and fuller life than was ever possible to his grandparents. We must acknowledge all that science has done and is doing for the welfare of our racem but the gifts of modern science can be misused.
The car, a motor-driven vehicle, facilitates business and gives harmless enjoyment to many, but it has caused more causalities in one year in this country alone.
Cinema can be used to educate and entertain in glorious ways, but it is often used as a channel for themes of vulgarity and false values.
Wireless communication devices can link the world together in a moment of time, but it can also be used improperly to spread lies, propaganda and promote dangerous values and beliefs. Aeroplanes make travelling quick and simple.
It can also become a weapon of destruction. It is this two-fold aspect of its use, a thing of science created by science, that poses the same question about science itself.
It is morally justifiable to make any perfect discoveries an inventions which can be used for purpose of destruction.

Tea: an effective cure for breast cancer
According to a new research, three cups of tea a day,
if taken, can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age, by more than a third.
In a research carried out by the Moffitt Cancer Institute, in the American state of Florida, it was revealed that the risk of occurrence of breast cancer tumors, in such women below the age of 50 years
who drink at least three cups of tea a day, is reduced by up to 37%.
It was also revealed in the research that there was no significant benefit, in these regards, in the woman aged above 50, who drank three or more cups of tea a day.
Experts believe that the reason for this is that tea has such ingredients in it, which are more effective against specific tumors which generally occur in women below the age of 50.
In the Moft Cancer Center, situated in Tampa city of the State of Florida, a research was carried out on 5 thousand women who had taken the treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 70 years.
The experts compared their medical record and life pattern with that of women who were safe from breast cancer.
The experts also found out that on a particular type of cancer, Lobular, tea had shown a great effect and it reduced by 66 percent.
Almost every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type of it.
This type of cancer is more dangerous, because it is deep inside and is usually diagnosed when it has already spread to a great extent.
Experts say that by taking at least three cups a day regularly, the danger of breast cancer can be reduced in young women.
They say that making tea a regular drink in daily life can cause great resistance in the body against breast cancer.
In Britain, every year, almost 40 thousand women are diagnosed to have breast cancer.

Why the Reduction of Exercise with Increasing Age?
New research
Exercise is good at every age to remain healthy.
It makes your heart stronger, reduces cholesterol levels, helps control weight, helps in limiting diabetes and slows the Alzheimer's process.
Unfortunately, many people with increasing age have a reduced ability to exercise.
Experts says with exercise our body and brain remains alert, yet aging can affect it.
According to American Medical Association, if exercise is excluded from daily life there can be many health problems that can develop in the future.
Dr. Patricia P. Leka of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says that an increase in age is a big reason for man's decrease in exercise and physical activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.
She headed research regarding heart disease and a man's ability to do exercise in older age.
A team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of the heart.
They studied how the heart contracts and relaxes as it pumps blood.
Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is responsible for pumping blood.
They came to know that as age increases, problems increase in the relaxation action of the heart.
Dr. Patricia says with an increase in age, problems occur in the relaxation of heart and this effects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research.
He says that they were surprised to see that it has an effect, as it confirmed that poor exercising ability is closely related to the heart's relaxation phase.
Some times blood pressure can cause disorders in the heart such as its functions and heart diseases.
If the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard, then they can take advantage of the benefits of exercise even with age.
A detailed report in this matter is published in a magazine of the American Medical Association.
No Chances of War with Pakistan: Indian Army chief
Indian Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor - No War with Pakistan
He has accused that despite the commitments and international pressure on Pakistan as a result of Mumbai attacks, the infrastructure of terrorism is not only existent but also proactive in Pakistan.
He said this while talking to the correspondents in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day tour to the valley of Kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in New Delhi, administered by Kashmir and in preparation of armed forces on the borders.
He was asked a question about his thoughts on the media reports that Pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from India regarding the Mumbai attacks.
General Kapoor said that the decisions of peace or war matters are decided by the political leadership.
When asked about the presence of terrorist factions, he said that the Indian army would face such groups who attempt to disturb the peace and are bent upon weakening India.
He said that in Kashmir, at least 700 to 800 militants are known to be present, of which approximately half are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that with an improvement in the seasonal weather, there might be an increase in infiltration from Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. However, India has increased the guard at the borders.
He refuted the possibility of decrease in the army posting in Kashmir, saying that there can be no compromise with regards to national security.
May Allah bless the tongues of the world, and may Obama become a blessing for the world.
Although this development was unexpected, we shall see how this change  will work out in regards to Pakistani-American relations.
We shall also see what Barack Obama, who is the result of Martin Luther King's dreams, gives to the world.
Obama (whose middle name is Hussein) taking the oath today as the American President is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance, but also a historic test.
Not only for himself, but also for all the people who supported him.
It will even be a test for the white majority, as for them to accept a black person governing over them is no easy task.
Here in South Asia, the Muslims which have some expectations from Obama, should remember that Obama has been elected the president of America. Obama should remember that America is practically  the president of whole world.
After a while, a person whose ancestors were slaves and bought from different regions of the world, is going to become the 44th president of America.
People have many expectations from this man.
Obamas fans should not expect something unrealistic from him.
If Obama becomes successful in decreasing the religious and racial acrimony, it will be a victory for his fans.
How will South Asia be affected by this change, and can it be expected to get any meaningful change in American policies?
How will Pakistan and America's relationship will be affected by this change.
image not available
The Presence of Obama or others does not matter because the strong Jewish lobby is the real authority which decides the policy and types of relations with other world.
As Pakistan is concerned, The world saw how aggressive behavior was shown by the triangle; America, India and Israel after Mumbai Attacks.
Even for a while, after Pakistan was formed, the managing of Swat was left to the Ruler of Swat, which had its own army and law.
They surrendered their rule to the government of Pakistan according to a treaty.
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a stepmother.
There has been no increase in the number of schools in Swat, since the rule of the Ruler of Swat was finished.
Nor was there any interest in construction and development over there.
The number of girls receiving education in the present rule is many times less than their number in the previous rule.
In the Sarhad state of Pakistan, the local Taliban have been targeting the educational institutions.
The most schools were destroyed in Swat province, of which the majority were girls' schools.
Not only this, but the Taliban have announced the prohibition of girls' education in Swat.
Thousands of male and female students are being deprived of education.
What do you think the Taliban have to gain by eradicating female education?    What would the Taliban have to gain by eradicating female education?
Why has the government been unsuccessful in stopping these illegal steps?    Why has the government not been able to stop these illegal steps?
What do you think the government should do?    What is it that you think the government should do?
The question should be, what does the ISI and Pakistani agencies get?    The question should be, what do the ISI and Pakistani agencies get?
Because the public of Swat have realized this was a game, and that the army was there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them. Otherwise, how could five schools be blown up in a single curfew night? How could people be slaughtered during curfew and hung in the main circle of the town?    Because the people of Swat have realized that this was a game and the army was there to serve the Taliban and was not there to kill them. How else could five schools have been blown up in a single curfew night? How could people be slaughtered during curfew and be hung in the main circle of the town?
When the government is not being allowed to have any say in Swat, how can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps?     How can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps when they are not allowed to have any say in Swat?
Now, the question arises, as to when the government has an armed military, new and dangerous weapons, new technology and spy system etc., then why are these four Taliban not being controlled?   Now the question is, why are these four Taliban not being controlled when the government has armed military, new and dangerous weapons, new technolgy, new spy systems and more?
The answer to this is that they have the hand of a hidden guide on their heads, because of which neither do their weapons get exhausted, nor do they get captured.   The answer to this is that they have the hand of a hidden guide on their heads because their weapons do not get exhausted nor do they get captured.
The conclusion is that the Taliban, through there dark activities is making the work of the global leadership easier.     The conclusion is that the Taliban through their dark activities are making the work of global leadership easier.
15 years ago, the war was on in Afghanistan.    The war was going on in Afghanistan fifteen years ago.
The ISI controlled the Taliban while Russia, India and Iran aided the opposing side: the northern coalition.
Suddenly the scenario changed and the Taliban's activities came into the light.
The ISI was also offered financial aid by the Americans, ultimately causing past friends to become foes.
Now the war rages on, but the Pakistani supporters are still the same: Iran, India and Russia.
Until humanity is able to understand the difference between right and wrong, we will always make bad decisions.
For example, if a thief intends to commit a crime, realizes it's wrong he will also fear his Lord and then he will not commit the crime.
Now in the same manner: until Israel understands that it is commiting wrong acts by shedding the blood of innocent people in Gaza, it will be punished for as long as it continues to kill innocent people there.
Greetings!
The question: is war and aggression the answer to the Terrorist issue?
If not, then what is that answer that can move us toward solving this issue?
It is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but adds 'blessings' to them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development that Nelson Mandela used in South Africa.
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
After the Kashmiris took part in the elections, it appears that they have accepted this point of view.
We are in  the third week of Israeli attacks on Gaza and the number of deaths have risen to close to a thousand.
To date, a ceasefire was not possible despite worldwide diplomatic efforts.
According to another report, since the attacks began on December 27, 90,000 Palestinians have left their homes and moved to a safer location.
Aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, saying that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victims of severe psychological and emotional problems.
What are you saying?
What should happen next?
How is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Give Taliban a Chance.
Basit, Peshawar.
Wake up! If the Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down girl's schools?
And kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
The Taliban has damaged Islam in such a way that no other nation or religion has done.
Pushtun force
Kohat, Pakistan
If the entire Muslim world gets together and just warns Israel they will attack it, you will see how much Israel's daddy, America, will get hurt.
Not only will their be immediate talks of ceasefire, there will also be an actual ceasefire.
But what can be done? Where can our leaders get that much courage?
Someone should tell Ahmedinejad that he should take the lead. BBC forums are filled with discussions of your bravery.
The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights falls not only upon the Arabs, or the Muslims of the world, but rather it is the duty of all the nations in the world that they speak up against oppression.
This troubling incident is one of the worst of Bush's misdeeds thus far.
Similar to how government institutions are looted in Pakistan and India on the 30th of June before the close of the financial year, in the same way Israel was given the green light to do whatever it wants before the American government winds things up.
On one hand, America says that it will work towards a ceasefire.
On the other hand, the United Nations is passing resolution after resolution, but all have been futile. This only cements the idea that the UN is a party to Muslim oppression.
All Muslim countries should immediately revoke their United Nations membership and lay the foundations for a united state of Islam.
There are many evident examples of America and the United Nations only promising and passing resolutions. In the end, it is the Muslims who suffer.
What is the use of such propaganda, when the BBC doesn't even publish the matter?
Now where are all the ideals of journalism buried? When unjustified bloodshed, especially of a Muslim, occurs, BBC takes a neutral position.
by the way is a flag bearer of rights
to raise voice is a far reality, the limit of hypocrisy is that it doesn't even publish the views
from the Muslim side
The only difference between you and the Jews is that the latter call themselves Jews, they martyr Muslims and living amongst Muslims like you they call themselves Muslims
syja786
For a long time, BBC forums have been using a certain word, sometimes while discussing suicide attacks and other times, while discussing terrorism in India.
The most used word in these anti-Islamic comments is extremism.
But, can you easily figure out who is extremist from the above comment?
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal cannot be fought with the sword?
When you see the innocent victims of Israeli bombings, if your heart does not cry tears of blood, then what does it do?
But the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is the idea that we try to use the name of Jihad to disfigure the beautiful face of Islam.
When the majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existence of Israel, then what need does Hamas have to send missiles into Israel or conduct suicide attacks?
The behavior on both sides is misanthropic.
The actions of the UN and the US seem to be in favor of these crimes by Israel.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
And we should re-think how we are giving the real terrorists an anti-terrorism Nobel Prize for their painstaking efforts against terrorism, as after all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, would it be possible for terrorism to take place at such a large scale without the support of some big leader? And everyone knows who is controlling the strings.
In easy words, such gangsters are told to do whatever they want.
What a forceful act, being hit on the head and not being allowed to cry.
The medicines for the injured, the shroud and compensation for the dead are being given by the Arab rulers, and the question is,
Israeli attacks, what should happen?
The actual problem is that the leaders of all the Muslim countries, including the Saudi king, are in a deep sleep. They neither have an army, nor any protective plans. They think they can support and fulfill their responsibility.
They should take immediate action against Israel.
Such as stopping the sale of petrol to Europe and America, but unfortunately...
Salaams to all sisters and brothers.
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans. It is similar to considering them defeated.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house. This is a rule of nature. The steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
These power intoxicated elephants do not realize what is happening.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Israel and Hamas should enter a truce so that the death and destruction can come to an end.
Mohammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France
That was absolutely correctly stated.
Supposing that Hamas is 100% correct and they are struggling against oppression to become successful in the eyes of Allah. Even then, they should know that if a good deed results in the destruction of an established house, it is no longer a good deed.
Those who claim to love God love the messenger and love their religion. Loving mankind is a part of their faith.
They act as if it is the order of Allah to evacuate all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than the Muslims.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
The order is not to kill them, but rather to attempt to convert them to Islam.
However, for those who work against the religion, the order states to initiate "Jihad" against them.
The order states to fight them until they stop their resistance against Islam. However, this definitely does not mean that one wears a jacket made of explosives and explodes in the middle of a crowd.
Brothers, killing innocent children can only lead to destruction.
But I would like to tell my friends that yesterday the Israelis did not have any place of refuge, but today they have become so strong that they do not listen to anyone. This is because the Jews are united.
They do not have sects such as Shia or Sunni. They are all just Jews, and they have done everything for the sake of progress.
On the other hand, what is the state of the 55 Islamic countries?
They are behind in every field, and now the situation has become that they are so helpless that the enemy is killing them, and they are simply waiting to die.
The need is for all the Muslim countries to get together and prepare a plan of action against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan.
There is no better course of action than accepting Israel. They could learn new technology and ways of success from them, and also let the world live in peace.
Muslims have great land and resources.
The need is correct usage.
First of all, the most tragic part is that Hammas and Alfatah could not be united.
The only reason to destroy great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin was to weaken the only nation fighting for the Aqsa Mosque; and it was impossible until Yasir and Yasin were eliminated.
The world was watching that Palestine was falling down every second after the death of these two leaders.
..., and how this lobby of Jews strengthened their target by every moment.
In 1974, a Pakistani Prime minister was in such world power that he led all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100% attendance for the first time in history.
Today, on his 81st birthday, is it hard for this nation to make a promise to whether or not it will be able to unite itself.
Moreover, by resolving Muslim conflicts (Islamic common wealth establishments) will cause trouble to its incomplete mission.
this is that jinn which lap to Palestinian since more than half century
This demon has many faces.
many time this jinn on his some other face give a bad remarks for his own self to turn back worlds pressure and concentration.
and this jinn other face eating peoples in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
and this jinn have a big fear of Islam, as this jinn knows that when ever he pull out this only and only by Islam Muslims and Muslims complete religion and act of Islam pull out because history said that Islam put on right track many biggest Abujahal.
Israels fighter jets started bombarding Gaza and launching missile attacks from the 27th of December.
In these attacks more than three hundred residents died.
After air attacks, now Israeli tanks and bulletproof vehicles prepare to go to war through land and reach the Gaza boundary.
United Nations Security council on its emergency gathering agreed to ask for an immediate stop of violent activities from Israeli and Palestinian forces.
Although, an Israeli official said that it will continue its action in Gaza until he believes that the missile attacks against Israel will end.
What is your suggestion for Israel? Do you agree that this action is for the stability of Israeli defense?
What is the role of the rest of the world in this scenario?
Will this intense action take part in Israel's next election?
After newly elected president Barack Obama takes his position, will there be any improvement in the middle east?

When has the night of loneliness been spent shedding tears?
"When has a calamity been averted only by supplication?" (Nawab Zadah Nasrullah Khan)
BBC searches for such comments and publishes them.
After all, it has to keep up the flag and perception of non-alignment.
As such, the news on BBC is usually true, but the main thing is the tone.
Which thing should be highlighted, and which piece of news should be expressed as less important?
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
In this practice, our Pakistani Wire-net media in particular, some columnists and newspapers are not far behind any more.    They are writing with courage against the growing extremism and terrorism, and stressing a lot upon 'Muawiyah hate'.
He said that the United Nations, which speaks of human rights and peace, but though the Muslims are being oppressed greatly.  You hear them say that until Hamas does not stop it's attacks, this unfair policy will continue.
Why Muslims are getting abused, If People like America will leave the back support of Jews then Allah has said clearly that this caste will spend there life contemptible and this caste can not spend there life good,  if American Citizens has the guts to leave the Back support of Jews then see the Fortune of the life of Jews
The people who are killing and murdering people in the name of peace and justice have to understand this clearly: that in this world, peace will come only by administering an oath, not by doing injustice and dissemination.
Only by doing dissemination, you can kill the caste and may withdraw the results. What you want then after Hitlers Measure is not only the Jews caste continued, but in one way the ascent, which as of today is impossible.
In the Words of the poet
Abuse is again an abuse if it gets greater, then it will be erased.
Blood is again a blood if it falls down, then it will freeze.
Now who will say to whom what is terrorism?
Why does all this not come under terrorism?  Why is it that only our pain seems to be like every ones pain?
Why are the other people not human beings or has only Muslims' blood become so cheap? These many innocents' blood were not red in color.
Now from nowhere, why are the condolences not coming?
I watched the progress of the Mumbai incident, as if my own house was on fire. The sorrow of humans can not be watched without empathy.
How can words describe the bodies strewn on the streets, helpless,innocent people, injured and soaked in blood?
I feel like crying about the helplessness of Muslims, the fact that people are dying in India, and the whole world is climbing onto Pakistan, without any proof and saying, "take action or else we will."
In addition, Israel is ruthlessly killing Muslims and the whole world is silent. This is unbearable.
There is delay, but no darkness, with God. That too, when this darkness comes to pass.
Danger to Israel, with America present, is a joke.
As for elections, there is no doubt that, in order to gain public support, such actions will have to be taken for the sake of power, especially in a state like Israel. As for Barack Obama, history bears witness to the fact that no American ruler has been able to go against the American political climate,nor will they. Whether the ruler is white or black, he is still a ruler.
From the discussions going on in the forum, it seems that everyone is hurt over her death, but as a politician, her mistakes have not been ignored.
This issue of whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power remains a source of great debate.
If democracy was dearer, why did she leave the republic for ten years in the control of Musharraf, waiting for American clearance and deal?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the people needed her the most. Unfortunately she came to Pakistan when she had to deal with cases and was then promised a seat of power.
The blames that are being laid down on historical figures are not addressed by anyone.
Sana Khan
Because some things are overlooked in these circumstances, nothing can be done.
One more Kari
Ladies and gentlemen, perhaps it is because you have studied the history not only of Pakistan but its four friend nations and seven other nations, that you find the arguments of Mr Psycho more appealing.
Tariq Ayyaz
Those who don't deserve such education shouldn't get it.
The reflection of the pine in water never became green.
Britain never allowed the two to be united. It always came up with a new Hindu Muslim conflict which was looked after by Sir Syed.
Psycho
How merciless is our nation? We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party. Now, when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.
We have succeeded a lot!
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored. We are thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar, if you en wreathe him with books.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks, Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.
If they talk about war, then both the sides will suffer human loss.
India says that a Pakistani citizen was caught in the Bombay attacks. He has written and sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. Earlier, when India caught this extremist, they say he is a smart engineer but later they declared him to have studied only four grades. All this should be considered.
First of all, Merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and all our Christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
We do not want the flames of fire but, the flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem, if peace cannot be a solution. Then war will ravage not only the nation in which it is fought but, the homelands of the nations waging the war.
In only extreme human instances will war give solution to problems.
It will bless the world and it's people with fire and blood.
It will cause hunger and extinguish existence.
Therefore wise humans will strive to use political means to resolve matters before it turns to a war.
It is better to avoid war and let politics prevail.
In both our country and yours.
It is better that the gloom is kept being lightened by hope of peace.
The India-America relations have strengthened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly support talks and assist in a lasting peace process with Pakistan.
This is that old history of America.
Because in the case of an Indian attack, America's goals will also be fulfilled at the expenses of India.
Pakistan should clearly announce that it will not start, but if injury is caused, there will be no talks of peace or truce, and the war will not stop until India is completely destroyed or captured, even if it involves them destroying themselves.
This is Islamic history.
Before the resolution, the message that had to be given to the public by the army was given.
In compensation for the Mumbai attacks, the abnormal diplomatic and military benefits that India tried to gain, made it more of a victimizing party, than a victim. That is why, in contrast to the harsh initial global reactions the world has now reduced their force on Pakistan.
The satisfaction expressed by the United Nations over Pakistani efforts and the praise by the Interpol leader on the efforts. In disregard of India's commotion, shows the side effect of its more than necessary diplomatics.
There is no two opinions about this being a very beastly action.
But the question is, when thousands of Taliban were attacking Pir Samiullah's town, where was the Pakistani Army, and what were they doing?
Should the army not be taken into account, as to what they did there for one year?
Every day, how many members of the Taliban die due to the firing of the thousands of shells being fired by mortars and cannons.
I appeal to the ICI that they stop their guardianship of the Taliban, for Gods sake, and let us live peacefully in paradise like Swat.
And they stopped this fixed operation.
The day is not far, when a resolution will be passed in the United Nations, against army intervention in Pakistan, in the same way it was passed against Jama'athud-Da'wah.
Riyaz Ahmad Farooqi
First of all, our radicalism and our protecting them, is alone, sufficient to provide complete proof and permissibility for action against us. And the very day such a resolution is passed, there is all probability that no voice will be raised in our support, in the United Nations.
And suppose the passing of such a resolution is delayed. Some other strength will definitely leave our aid to ourselves, keeping the example of America in front of them.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
The bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are eternal even after death.
But here an international game is being played. Here ferocity and animosity are created to do the ruling.
So there can be reason created that if we are not here then these vandals and animals can come take over the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so-called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
America sees the torture of these extremists but instead of being sad about these faithless activities, they easily call them "tribal culture".
The reason for these faithless activities, sometimes given in the name of tribal culture and other times in the name of Islam, is not something done by a person with a heart.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so brave that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also men of God and so is our army.
It is very clear that this is fishy.
Instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, the discussion of various disastrous occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was seen. And besides the event of hanging dead bodies, their literature and books like "What Will Happen After Death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
As you have frightened the world of the fires of hell,
you yourself have become the reason of fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Who burnt the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on the refusal of the oath after the Prophet (PBUH) passed away, and who took her husband by the rope in his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
Was the attack on Medina by the the Army of Yazid and and the incident of Karbala was the conspiracy of Jews and Pagans?
Without accepting the facts, neither motives can be removed nor these can be corrected?
BBC people, stop this dual policy!
The better super hit title than this is:  the beating  of Bush with shoes is right or wrong?
this should have been the topic.
Tahir Chowdary, Japan
Be ashamed, the body of a person was taken out of the grave and hanged on a pole because he spoke against the cruelty and you are struck up over the topic of Box Office.
The success of operation Sherdil, and across the boarder, the success of operation Lion Heart depends on the direction of sympathies of common folk.
This step was taken by American and Pakistani intelligence agencies, and Pir Sahib is the victim of this conspiracy
All the comments on this forum would be against the Taliban, because intelligence agents have successfully infiltrated the Taliban ranks and they are carrying out  actions that can change people's perception.
I only want to ask that while this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public? They even report something like this: 'While bombing Taliban residences, a stray shell kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and beg them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000, in Swat went there to do.
The bodies of the Taliban who helped the army are left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green-footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC, did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake, stop this drama.
The Talibans have tarnished the Muslim image.
If true Muslims from all over the world don't call these terrorists Muslims, then how are these elements able to live in the lands of true Muslims?
Those who become shameless, can't do hard labor.  They pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or the barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
No religion or family traditions allow this.
Including BBC, all the media present their views in different styles on Taliban or the tribal people.
No one is aware of the ground realities or what the truth is. It is us, the tribal people, who know what the problem is.
In short, it's a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a Talib or a Tribal. Who made these institutions? Warmongers who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions.
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute the leader of MQM, Althaf Husain, and the leaderships of ANP and PPP, as they have spoken against this cancer, i.e. the Taliban.
This cancer was given birth to by Zia-ul-Haqq. He has gone, but he  destroyed Pakistan as he went.
But I have hope that the present government will eradicate this cancer.
After the Mumbai attacks, India  said that there were some Pakistani extremists behind the attack.
Pakistan refuted these claims and said that it would help India's investigation in every possible way.
India said that they have given Pakistan a list of the suspected extremists, which India wanted.
Now, Pakistan said that the Jaish-e-Mohammad leader, who is included in the list, Moulana Mas'ood Azhar, is not under house arrest, and that the government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Previously, the President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari had rejected the idea that western intelligence agencies and the Indian government had provided Pakistan proof about the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said, regarding Ajmal Kasab, that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
At that time, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that their relationship with India could not improve as long as their land continues to be used for terrorism.
And in the latest developments, the Indian cricket team canceled their tour of Pakistan.
Should these political events affect sports.
What does the future of Info-Pak relations look like?
Neither America nor India will break Pakistan.
Pakistan will break itself.
Faced with so much division, regionalism, and infiltration, what else can you expect?
Time has proved that Jinnah did not treat the Indian Muslims well.
Yasmin, Chicago
Madam, if work was continued in Jinnah's manner, the tumors of regionalism, division and infiltration would have never spread in Pakistan, nor would the Indian Muslims have been treated in this way.
It is our fault that we couldnt reproduce a leader of similar stature.
If we can't respect our leaders, then who can we respect?
There are many able people in this part of the world.
God knows when some sense will return to the people and the blessing of consensus in opinion will help develop this area.
In both countries, the Mullahs, Pundits, Taliban, Shiv Sena and the RSS have been established to oppose the peace process.
Destructive forces don't want this area to develop and for that, these countries are manipulated like puppets.
Can you imagine, with consensus between Pakistan, India and China, what position they would have in the world?
It is God's punishment that has positioned thieves, robbers, and manipulators as leaders of this country.
May God safe guard Pakistan from any harm, amen.
Sir, open your eyes and look around and see the current situation and realities that reveal the extent to which the Americans have progressed.
Moreover, the internal affairs don't seem to be good, as you can see the circumstances in NWFP, Balochistan and in Karachi in Sindh.
In this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
O Allah bestow your mercy upon us.
According to my understanding, a final war is inevitable.
This is enough of it.
Now it should be do or die.
This problem cannot be solved through these acts of insincere dialogues.
And not through small scale terrorism in each other's country.
After all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
And if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all of our political parties agree on this matter: these terrorist and denominational activities should be terminated from the country.
But our army rule does not seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, American and Europe are made to believe that we are with you on this war against terrorism, and the other hand, we also help Taliban secretly.
We have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way. Thank you.
There is no doubt in this that the majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are the members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined  the party  named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.
Although these members preferred subsidiary activities and are now after India's great persistence, The United Nation has invalidated it also and Government of Pakistan is continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it would be better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
Terrorist groups present in Pakistan, who support professional criminals and the heads of those Mullahs are those who call Pakistan the land of destruction.
And now they are doing everything to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called Human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan from these evil-doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to ponder whether we should ban these traitors or not?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose work is only to kill.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What kind of world is this where life is hard for one who takes the name of a major pillar of Islam, the religion of Allah.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims but when Muslims even try to take revenge, all our hypocritical leaders together with all the non-Muslim world persecute them, just like our great leader Hafiz Saeed is being treated today.
India may have some responsibility for the Bombay attacks.
Relations with Pakistan are bitter. The relationship between the two countries had improved over the last few years but has been been greatly disrupted.
India has always held the military and non-military groups in Pakistan responsible.
And putting the relationship back on track is being hindered by operations against these groups.
Indian security departments have held Lashkher-e-Tayyaba responsible for the Bombay attacks.
In this way a lot of times Jamat-Ul-Dawa's name comes up.
This was not the first time that terrorism has caused intense relations in between two countries.
On December 2001 after attack on Indian parliament these two neighbors came to war.
And after putting sanctions against Lashkar-e-Taiba and enlisting it in a list of terrorist organizations.
On Jamat-UL-Dawa, on which a security analyst said that this is new face of Lashkar-e-Taiba asking for sanctions.
What is your suggestion should this sanction be granted or not?
Should Pakistan take action against terrorist group on its land?
India has put sanction on Jamat-Ul-Dawa at present
Pak crisis could resolve and for real peace between two countries.How important is it to finish the groups who have weapons?
United Nations Security Assembly has put sanction against Jamat- Ul-Dawa. At last what evidence they had to show that much hurry?
Public Tranquility Council will  never show this much of expertness against Muslims?
This we say as Accuser is Weak and witness is Strong!
If you see India has made itself as a Disappointed Country
Whom so ever Intelligence, Military and other Security Departments has been disappointed, only few terrorists have made them to dance for 72 hours and now India on its disappointment they are blaming Pakistan for this and trying to ruse the whole world
If one non Muslim is murdered then voices will be raised from whole world, why is this Double Mentality?
To my Dearest Countries one and only non politics, Religious, Cultural Organization -----------
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
Till the time Prophet PBUH, Saints and the Follower have given the respect to the Human beings, With Peace the Religion Islam was advertised a lot and was going on
Muslims has also got the Success on every Ground
When this Beautiful Religion brought to a normal person then the human beings have started differentiating the Muslim and non Muslim and then the New chapters of tumults and quarrel has been started, earlier the world was not aware of this
Go greet them sir. But at your own expense.
Don't do it under the pressure of America.
If India has any complaints, then it should come up with evidence.
Why don't they do so?
Why do they blame everything on us?
Extremist groups are also present in India, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the world?
What can India explain about its actions in Kashmir?
and how about the actions of Israel?
The truth is that we are the first Nuclear Islamic state in the world and that is the cause of all the hatred.
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart.
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be part of this conspiracy.
American are not slowly but now very swiftly tightening their grip on Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances, if we as a nation dos not display unity and solidarity, then if Bangladesh can be created, anything can happen.
Terrorism is condemned, whether it is in a hotel in Mumbai or in a Marriott Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine.
Likewise, regardless of the origin of the terrorists, they should be eliminated, whether they are Pakistani or Indian or American or Israeli.
Now the question is that why the whole world, including Pakistani officials, are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack carried out on the Marriott Hotel not a terrorist attack?
Then why?
Praise the worthy Advisor of the Interior, Mister Rehman Malik. By the grace of God, how brave he has become!

Not only this , according to the BBC Mister Malik has also tried to negate this impression with full strength that all these imprisonments are being carried out on whose orders.
Praise the Lord!
Having this capability or not, this I don't want to say.
Whose war are we Pakistanis fighting, and why?
We have our own priorities, which we shall protect with our full strength.
Nobody has the authority to interfere with any other country.
Apparently Colonial Period does not seem to exist.
If people are expecting justice, then they should impower law enforcement agencies, respect democratic institutions, and they should not help any dictator or military personal. Then the 3rd world country Pakistan could attain peace but it would be unacceptable for the Extremist groups.
Pakistan is already in favor of the European Union and America.
Even though majority of groups in Pakistan are against this favor.
So this promotes more opposition.
And if America and its allied forces should leave Pakistan and believe in democracy, then the people will start supporting the sovereignty by stopping their protest.
Pakistan is capable of deciding the issues by either dialogues or by arms.
Pakistani forces occupying Kashmir raided one of the camps of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba.
After Mumbai attacks pressure is on Pakistan that it should increase the operation against the Extremist Organisations.
India claims that the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba was involved in the  Mumbai attacks.

It is their claim that, without a doubt, the extremists who carried out the Mumbai attacks used Pakistani land.
In the meanwhile, officials in Peshawar claim that the lot of trucks which carry supplies to the united forces in Afghanistan was burnt by unidentified armed people, because of which more than 50 trucks were destroyed.
This is the second attack in Peshawar on NATO and American supplies in the last 48 hours.
In the meanwhile, Pakistan captured an established camp of the almost inexistent Lashkar-e-Taiba. Previously, lots of efforts were carried out to try to disarm armed groups all the way from Karachi to the tribal regions, which included giving compensation to those who returned their weapons and even assuring them that no action would be taken against them.
The situation is telling us that the efforts undertaken in the regime of General Ziyaul Haqq, after the previous Soviet Union's interference in Afghanistan to get rid of the armed groups that formed as a result of the resistance that started through American and Saudi funding, and to bring an environment similar to that before 1980 were not successful.
The question is what does Pakistan want to do?
Does Pakistan have the ability to do so?
What do you say?

I have only one question for all humanitarian leaders.
It is impossible that you murder their children and they bring garlands to you.

Is there any logic, reason, or philosophy which allows killing of innocent people, including Namazi, laborers and poor service men, as revenge to American attacks?
If your answer is no, you need to correct your point of view.
After Afghanistan, people were armed because there was a danger of Russia coming towards Pakistan.
Now that the danger is of America attacking Pakistan from the Afghanistan channel, as mentioned directly in the presidential campaign by the president himself, why should these people be unarmed?
It is because America and India will not have to face any public resistance after defeating the Pakistan army.
If any of them are involved in terrorist activities, only Pakistan should take action against them.
The sad fact of the matter is that leaders of Lashkare Tayyaba declared the accusations of India correct, that Pakistan was involved.
Najeeb Ur Rehman Psycho *Lahore*
Even if it is accepted that Lashkare Tayyaba is involved, still, the blame cannot be placed on the Pakistani Government.
And another question arises, "did these terrorists not have the aid of some government or non-government employee of India"?
Are the terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not prepared in India or other nations of the world?
As far as Laskare Tayyaba is concerned, it has no involvement in the recent incidents.
This should be kept in mind that Hafiz Saeed was the first Jihadi leader who claimed that the actions of Taliban were a Fitna.
I believe without a doubt that all the actions of the Taliban were an integral part of the American scheme, therefore it is necessary to eradicate anyone and everyone who stands in the way of the Taliban.
Despite the cooperation of the entire nation, launching an operation under the pressure of India shows the stature and non-existent leadership qualities of Zerdari and Co.
The operations started with American and Saudi's funding has to come to an end. To do so, it should be requested of them, "for God's, sake wipe out this filth that is consistently polluting our society."
America and Saudi spread in our country dangerous weapons and so-called "Jihadi", which is in reality hate-inciting and cultural virus enticing literature. Our country has become a human slaughterhouse because of this.
Due to the risk of attack from India, The Pakistani Army's announcement that it would remove forces from the Afghan border and post them at the Indian border, and the Taliban's announcement that it would handle the Afghan border caused America to stumble and pressure India not to attack Pakistan.
This showed the strength of America in the region.
Though India did not warn that they would attack, nor do they have that much courage.
The Taliban attacked and finished most of the remaining American supplies.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and tha Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi is the trade and financial center of Pakistan, and the Dubai of the backward regions.
Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty handed, but ever since the law and order situation in the western border regions was lost, all people diverted their attention here.
Now they want to kidnap this city.
Pathans are now called Pukhtons, made foreigners, and forced to fight, while the need in Pakistan is for unity.
One solution to the problem is to have the Urdu speak or learn Pushto or the Pushto to speak or learn Urdu. Alternatively, it would be best for everybody to learn English.
You must be thinking its a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
The cause of the torture is language.
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir in my childhood I had actually given the same suggestion many times to my friends ,which included people from every religion and rhetoric groups, but people used to laugh over these suggestions.
At that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not that evident but they were boiling up inside.
It is hard to understand what is happening and why.
Are these the signs of judgement day?
What are these innocent and innoxious people being killed for?
The reason is in front of everyone; there are those who want to break Pakistan into pieces and those who do all this neither belong to this religion nor this country.
Residents in Karachi and Mumbai set their own houses on fire.
Governments in power will typically change the names of airports, major roads and buildings, which is the case today  as infrastructure projects are renamed in memory of Baynazeer.
Is Baynzeer referring to what is going on with the people of Karachi and Pakistan?
The Indian spy agency RAW ended sectarian violence while the Mumbai attack was at its peak, proving that the agency's past political figures were gone.
Pakistani's from Karachi to Khyber have been awakened because of the spilling of innocent blood of Pushto-speaking people and persistent threats from India.
Angry applause from political, religious, sectarian and national bodies have taught India lessons in diplomacy, and also forced American strategists to re-think their own positions.
The turmoil in Karachi is cause by Mutahida and the Awami National Party, which favors a one-party system that is not   neutral.
The establishment could have controlled the events in an hour, but it intentionally allowed the event to escalate.
Pressured by political parties, the police and Rangers did not take action.
Political parties must forgo their own vested interests and work for the common man if they want their visions to become reality.
These kinds of incidents will keep taking place until there is pressure on the administration.
I think that these people are the biggest terrorists.
Foreign powers are definitely involved in this, but no one knows who they are.
But alas, that if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there, but since its not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
The government should operate here and save one of this country's largest and most important cities from terrorism
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
Also, BBC Urdu is not writing the truth under pressure-- Pakistani media's condition is already weak.
The whole truth is there on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that either Urdu speakers should learn Pushto or Pushto speaking learn Urdu. The best solution would be if every body could learn English.
You will definitely take this as a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
that language is the reason of violence?
There was another story of cruelty recorded in Karachi, the terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
Wherever one could do something, he did everything. Reports on the media are 50% of what has happened here in four days.
Citizens Stayed awake in the last four nights and are still afraid.
Who evacuated hotels, killed cobblers peanut sellers.
causing depredation on Super highway and cutting off ears of the innocents are all not aware of the punishment of Allah, which will catch them one day.
In your opinion, what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
Placing in front of us the heart-rending attacks on Bombay, we certainly do not have to dive deep to find the reasons for this disturbance in Karachi. There is one simple and easy reason that this disturbance caused the of spilling of blood.
It is evident that if some one will knock kneed with the father, it is not unusual for the son to get out of control.
The blood of Liyaqath Ali Khan and many other brave hearts was also from there. I am writing this poem to get rid of Saiko's misunderstanding.
We are doomed to repeat the traditions of our elders.
They sacrificed their lives to build; we will give our lives to save.
Faizan Touseef Siddiqi
It is very sad that we are fighting each other while our whole country is under attack.
I will tell Mr. Siddiqi to check Wikipedia.org.
Liyaqath Ali Khan was from a respectable Punjabi family in the Karnal region of the Punjab district.
The immigrants embrace him today because of his efforts to help them in their plight.
Every action has a reaction.
I can bear my soul, but...
Consequences of noises.
many of us who live in large towns and cities have grown used to working in noise which comes from several different sources. There are noises of moving trains which are heard at almost all hours of the day.
The Jet planes that fly over head produce noise of even greater loudness and intensity.
Most of us have no time to think of noises of one type or another.
They become part of our daily lives.
But there is something to be thought of-does noise affect our lives in some harmful ways?
already there is evidence that it does so in several ways. It has been recognized for a long time.
Now that exposure to noise high intensity leads to loss of hearing. There have been cases of boiler-makers, for example, who suffer from occupational deafness.
More recently it has also been found that people who are continuously exposed to other loud noises require protection of the ear.
If we live in industrial areas which are growing with every passing year, there are deafening noise produced by the speakers in house or shops, radio sets in the neighborhood, school children at play or at chorus practice of arithmetical tables, and so on.
MQM is a coalition with government, Muslim League(N) is secret partnership with government and Muslim League(Q) is the party that passed 17Th amendment, then how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17Th Amendment
This is the way to get ones name entered in the list of martyrs by just getting painted.
The Peoples Party is otherwise not in hurry to end the seventeenth amendment.
How any one can think of getting his own hands cut.
The seventeenth amendment cannot be abolished till Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of majority in one of our survey and it is also correct.
Zardari would not have opted to be the President, if seventeenth amendment was to be abolished.
Now he is more powerful than President Musharraf, since along with President he is also  the chairman of Peoples Party.
The seventeenth amendment is there till he is the president.
Political Parties will have to remove President Zardari first, in order to abolish  the seventeenth amendment.
This is not the will of MQM or the other parties.
Most people in our family are of the laborer type.
During our childhood, when we used to see our uncles toil, we used to wish in our hearts that Allah would save us from labor that is hard on the body.
To save ourselves from this, we wrote a letter to the editor of the Amroz daily, asking him what we can do after metric to save ourselves from having to toil.
The editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and study Science and Math subjects.
My focus was always on engineering, and after metric, instead of Biology, I took Technical Drawing.
Upon entering the FSC, my elder brother forced me to study medicine and become a doctor.
I studied Biology for a month with great difficulty, but I could not understand the subject, so I took math as a subject instead.
So the scare of having to work made me an engineer, and today I am in a better condition compared to many of my relatives the same age, for which I am always thanking Allah.
I remembered this when I was trying to lift the carpet with my two young sons at our old house.
It was not half an hour since we started working, and the younger son said, "Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job."
We said, "If that is true, then study a lot like us, and free yourself from bodily pain."
The son said, "I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work."
The three of us finished that work in three hours and returned.
My purpose of saying this is that if a person has set a goal, whatever be the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving his goal.
But if you do not even know what you have to do, then Allah alone is your protector.
They say that you should not speak bad about the dead, but what can I do, even after one year of Benazir's death, I can only see faults in her.
For personal interests, Benazir handed over the list of Sikhs who were fighting for independence to India, at the same time crushing the Sikhs independence movement and also allowing India to transfer its complete attention to Pakistan, having taken care of the Punjab movement.
The Russia wars in the regimes of Benazir and Nawaz Sherif have become a part of history, which pushed the country many years back.
Benazir continued to speak ill about Kashmir and the atomic program throughout exile.
Benazir Bhutto struck a deal with Musharraf, this contradicts her London Treaty with Nawaz Sharif.
Benazir allowed her husband to openly earn money during her term in office, this is why he came to be known as Mr. Ten Percent.
In Benazir's term, her brother was killed and his killer has  yet to be punished for his crime.
Despite being a woman, Benazir did not fight for women's rights.
In a way similar to how Benazir did treated her father's corpse, her husband is now treating her corpse in the same manner.
Benazir came to power twice, but did not use resources at hand to bring those guilty for the political killing of her father to justice. She could not even file a case against them.
It is 37 years since East Pakistan was separated from us. Looking at the amount of insensitivity on the part of the public and the rulers, no one ever mourned or expressed sorrow over their mistakes.
We should have been observing 16th December as a day of reflection and made plans to prevent the repeat of such events and incidents.
We should have been sending greetings to the people of Bangladesh on this day in an attempt to bring them closer to ourselves and healing wounds of the past.
The ruler should have opened the Jamudur Rahman commission file, reviewed the facts and information contained within. Then drew conclusions over the causes of separation of West Pakistan.
To help the people who are sick and in trouble in Bangladesh, and for their safe return  and  motivation, gifts are sent to them.
We have no feelings, our neighbors died and we didn't even know about it.
We don't care about our brothers and sisters because we are selfish.
Big crisis's end and we became normal and return to our routines.
As eastern Germany and western Germany merges together, i wish  East and West Pakistan would come together.
We can be one again, if we scarifies for each other and get over with our selfishness.
This wish (dream) cant seem to come true in near future.
Today, in the news, it was said that the Governor of  Illinois was arrested for corruption.
To remove him from the office of Governor, State Congress is preparing to a start trial against him as soon as possible. One of our friends, who has a keen eye on the current affairs of Pakistan, proudly said that this is democracy.
In the USA every man is equal under the law.
There is your country, whose president was made after he had the corruption charges dropped.
We felt  unnerved of wit and asked, "What if a governor was arrested in America?" Once in Pakistan our prime minister was arrested during the night and was hung. Another time, a prime minister of Pakistan was exiled.
Tell me, has anything like this happened in America?
Pakistan was awarded guard of honor and bid farewell from the president's house who had broke the law of the country. Tell me, has anything like this happened in America?
The Chief Justice of Pakistan was laid off in such a way that even after the nations support, he was not reinstated. Tell me, has anything like this happened in America?
In Pakistan, a fake degree holder was appointed as health minister. Tell me, has anything like this happened in America?
A poor American accepted defeat after hearing this and laughing to no end.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by Americans from all sides.
From his smile, I can tell
The America is with his government, but he is forgetting that last year the same people were with Parvez Musharaf.
This picture was passed on, as if it was from some family.
Previously, such a photo was never printed in newspapers before, i.e. one president with three American agents.
It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased. Now more than one agent was needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.
It is also possible that this was done because of the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.
If he was a smart ruler, at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo, and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting.
If the rules of democracy are implemented in this photo, President Zardari is in minority.
According to democracy, the majority are the rulers of the country, and the is the photo speaking for itself who that is?
Paradise-like Swat is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
According to the government tactics so far, along with force, discussions have been ongoing.
But the use of force is not giving any benefit other than increasing the force of the Taliban, and increasing the public favor for them.
The government should eliminate the cause of the problem rather than use brute force.
By eliminating the sources, Fazlullah and the Taliban will be finished themselves.
The proposed Shariah bill of the ANP government will become a moderate solution to the problems in Swat.
But alongside the establishment of the Shariah, the government will also have to take care of economic problems.
From General Musharraf's initial few steps, it looked as if the nation would be freed of useless politicians, but the love for power changed all his plans.
Whatever our expectations were, after he joined the 'War On Terror', he began to consider himself irremovable.
Then, whatever we expected of him was no more.
Just as Bush's rule began to come to an end, he started to worry about the end of his own rule, and he struck a deal with thieves in the dark.
Even then, General Musharraf could have commanded the army, but the present government does not even know what is happening.
Whether in Bajod or Swat, the army cannot control terror, and instead they bomb the 'enemy', i.e. the public. Apart from loss of life and money, if they are making the 'enemy' psychologically ill, then we are the enemies, aren't we?
Terrorism struck the Swat area in the Frontier Province and are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area.
On one side, the government's writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side, the effect of the Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everyday in Swat.
On the third side, the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
The security forces claim the killing of many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but, in spite of these killings, the Taliban has not only gained strength but according to estimates, they have established their control over eighty-percent of Swat.
The result is that on the one hand, the government is not ready to accept its' defeat and on the other hand, the Taliban has established their hold.
In the end, who got the worst deal?: the poor citizens.
It is said that in Swat somebody asked, "what type of people are the Taliban?" The answer was, "very good people because they are the custodians of religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country."
Then the question was asked: how about the Army.  The answer was that the Army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.
Then it was asked, "who are the enemies of religion and the country" and the answer was, "the citizens."
I am astonished how the Pakistani Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban. Though I believe it was very easy to do.
Still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
After the girls schools, boys schools were being destroyed.
Curfews are called so that the Taliban can move around easily.
During curfew tonight, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
The question arises as to how they got there despite the curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone explain to the army how to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the Army can defeat any enemy.
You say that mostly blood is spilled in the world because of religion. Tell me if today, there were no religion, would all this killing not take place?
Are the Punjabi, Pathan, White, Black, Mahsood and other tribes the result of religion?
No, sir, no way! Only religion teaches that there is no black and white, there is no Punjabi and no immigrant. If it were not for religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between the white and the black, and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribe-brotherhood hatred.
Actually, only religion trains man's character and restricts him, as he has not come here on his own will, but rather the Creator of all that exists sent him here, and he must live here according to His commands.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France, for two years, I also felt the same way.
I do not know why people only expect us to call.
A resolution about Iraq, passed in a few hours, to send a "peace" force to Darfur is not at all a problem.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where there is a matter of death, we are still holding meetings about that.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
Is it for real that every one is waiting for it to end?
So that no other victim will even think about using a great damage causing weapon like a gun to fight for his rights?
Doesn't your heart ache whenever a father runs holding his son's dead body?
If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
But you are a shame to humanity.
At least it was proven that this area was Israel's country for thousands of years.
What should happen is that both the nations should live together happily and with love. But since they are controlled by either west or arab countries,  peace therefore,  cannot be formed here without their consent.
But even Iran wants to fight its proxy war right now.
Even if operations in Israel are halted for the time being, they will start again after another incident.
The interest of BBC's country is subject to the bestowing of America and Israel. And this is the reason why in the name of ""enlightenment"", they have come with a series of blogs based on ""darkness"" and doing one-way and a blind propaganda.
BBC is just doing formality. To gain sympathy is their only purpose and wish!
Mr. Moderator has requested that he may publish the commentry by this humble soul so that one can think BBC still has some integrity left.
Thank you.
No one knows about the author and the origin of this story, but the fact remains, in every era draculas have fed on innocent blood.
Every era has seen war as well as blood shed.
Surprisingly, the twenty first century man, who considers himself very civilized, is silent over this murder done publically in the day light.
How can he not realize, that whatever is happening is showing the ugliest face of humanity?

The winter rains are gone throughout the country, Dera Ghazi Khan included.
Presented is a poem about the different seasons. Enjoy reading about the changes in weather as you read this poem.
These rains are also from you
which when fell brings spring.
When it stops there is no movement
There was no reason for it to be that way.
Sometimes it spread day and night.
sometimes loudly, sometimes silently.
These rains are also from you
in some remembrance some night
on some suppressed ashes
Sometimes we blew out the flames.
Sometimes we burnt ourselves.
Sometimes every drop is painful.
And these rains are only because of you.
All these leaders are going to run away with their briefcases in hand, what do they care about what will happen to the country.
Let the population sell toothpaste or clean the bells of the Mandir with the peels of lemons.
And then our media is also corrupt, like our leaders.
The purpose of it is to get money out of the government, and nothing else.
And as far as the population goes, they can remain stupid because talking about them would be an even bigger stupidity.
Yesterday a strange incident took place.
All around police are running here and there but not asking about illegal parking.
Moreover, the NYPD was not in a mood to look at illegally parked cars.
It happened that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in the Hudson River.
Until now, it was just known that the "terrorists" were related to birds.
Yesterday was maybe New York's most historic cold.
Temperatures do not drop to this degree.
My jaw is beginning to hurt after a half an hour stroll outside.
Imagine what would have happened to those people who jumped from the plane into the river.
The happy news is that the people all together stayed safe.
Sad news is that the company sank like a ship in this financial crisis.
I reached New Jersey from the Westside Expressway and also saw that southbound is closed and still, what have I done?

I didn't see the lines at that exit.

We considered the Taliban group of Swat a freely non-religious sect against the education of women.
to show this upsetness every day in any plays demolished School and College of woman's.
This also went wrong on Monday's holy day: The Taliban used dynamite to demolish a boys school.

just a while before this, the wedding of a dog with a girl took place.
look at that groom.
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
it is the era of computers and their involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life.
many people have reservations over the increasing involvement of computers, for example, in financial matters.
while use of credit card bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
so now only through your financial matters like through your credit card, you can be located.
and in future, when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent, its benefits will increase more and more.
similarly, in the world of crime, instead of facing the dangers of robbing a bank, credit card information is stolen
similarly computers have become the source of friendship.
Social networking websites like Orket, Facebook and Myspace have the first accepting level.
But does it not come to your mind that as we obey these social networks we are going away from the people in fact.
So this way you have been seen your wanted people and their index in the match making websites.
Now can you spend your life with a person like you?
I can not spend and for this the wife is also called half body.
That she fulfills the parts that I am missing.
I am probably low gifted from mind.
I considered true all the advice from any elders.
And such I had assurance that my father knew the answer of every question in the world.
There was laughter upon me for it.
But only that is true that seems possible.
It is very troubling that there is the need to tell lies.
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
That is why I try to lie as little as possible.
That I do not falsely please others, that too I attempt in the name of Allah.
And I say Insha Allah (If God Wills) only when I am asking Allah to complete the work.
As for the intentions, only Allah knows best.
This is a despicable matter that arose due to distance from religion.
According to both our religion and Pakistani law, young children should stay with their mothers.
Their expenses are to be borne by the father, and the father can visit with his children.
Then when they become mature, they can live with whom they want.
The actual problems are the relatives who misguide them.
Feudalism has overshadowed our deeds.
Even here is thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in father's property so it is resisted, although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated.
These restrictions regarding relations have created many evils in society.
Concept of remarriage of a divorced women, or a widow is becoming rare.
Due to these unnecessary beliefs and traditions, the family system is facing disarray.
Why is it in our society, if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarries, it is not appreciated?
A Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago,  had all his children married, but when he married a widow, his own children went against him.
In my opinion, this is due to religion, is it not?
As long as we are alive, we will never accept that any one else can take the place of mother. Is this kind of thought rational?
In my view Sirs children think that even though all of his children are now married, his marrying a widow woman is wrong. Is there anything wrong with what he has done?
In this way the widow woman will get some support, and the uncle will get someone to take care of the home.
You can be sure that his children are busy in their own personal lives and are not devoting much time to him.
I do not know why.
What will the old man do if their wives refuse to serve him tomorrow?
This is a result of pressure from society.
The fathers family and children will feel ashamed when people starting laughing about the fathers second marriage.
The family defended the father's second marriage stating it was in Islam's view.
For the past 40-50 years it seems venery has been one of the curses on our society.
It is acceptable for a wife if her husband does unlawful actions but it is not acceptable for him to marry another woman.
If its in her power, she will not let him do so even after she dies.
It destroys her afterlife along with her husband's. It also lets the spreading of immorality in the society.
Nothing happens when singing about Islam. We actually like our traditions and cultures.
For example, we like keeping girls from getting an education and fear of love marriage.
About your question, instead of bringing his wife home, he goes to someone else's wife and the dependents make a fuss for the show and stay quiet and satisfied. ( yeah, later the relatives of the wife get angry)
In the Indian subcontinent, we accepted Islam centuries ago but we could not let go of this illiterate thinking of how our culture and traditions are not more valuable than Islam.
Considering man's 2nd marriage as ridiculous, divorce as denigration, divorced as untouchable, love marriage as dishonor and considering a man marrying an older women is dissimulation of the women is only the result of this way of thinking.
Over all, by copying the western world, we are declaring the religious veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam was easy but getting rid of this way of thinking is very hard.
Allah give us courage and daringness.
Amen.
It was not really difficult to write Urdu before.

When I was coming back to the shop after Isha prayer tonight, one man who was sitting in his car raised his hand and asked me to come.
I thought maybe this man has forgotten his way or maybe he wants to ask something. I stopped, and his whole family was in his car.
He asked if I can understand Arabic very well or not. I said that there is no problem. You can tell me what is the matter.
He started saying, I have come from Riyadh but here some one in Medina picked my pocket and I need help. I said no, because this has happened with me earlier also as I gave this man 20 riyals to pay for gas and go back to Riyadh but he started doing the same thing after moving forward a little.
I got really angry and when I threatened to tell the police, he vanished.
So now this is the condition of us Muslims that even when we come to beg money, we come with families riding in cars and daily manage to get at least 2 or 3000.
Although there is an saying of the Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the hand above is better than the hand below and the hand above is the giving hand the lower is the taking hand.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims (Amen)

Javed Iqbal the wife of famous singer Adnan Sami reached a police station in Bombay accusing him of torturing her.
The police station suggested that she should contact the court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Guladari submitted a plea against her husband that Adnan Sami tortures her continuously.
As well as treats her inhumanely.
Now this has exceeded her tolerance limit, therefore a case should be recorded against Adnan Sami.
The police stated that instead of recording a report she should contact the court, because this type matter is not what comes under police control.
In your opinion, is the accusation stated by Saba Guladari against her husband Adnan Sami correct?
What if this accusation is an attempt of tarnishing the name of Adnan Sami?
Let us know of your comments regarding this matter.
Adam Saanghar, stamp.
as far as blame is concerned, so any man can do on another.
There is nothing more important than respect.
what-so-ever relation of present wife and Adnan Samih , Adnan Samih leave his respected life and went India to earn money, now this popularity made hurdle for him.
This is due to his own deed.
Washington
A high level American official said that President Obama made strong policy against Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
On this new policy of America about Afghanistan give more importance on War instead of Development.
An official said that Hamid Karzai consider as a hurdle in Afghanistan to get American Aid, because corruption in the government, intoxication business get increased and Taliban forces get regathered.
American official said that those people from American government who put pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more in which vice president Joe Biden and representative of Brack Obama for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke included.
He said that this policy appeared after President Bush, who used to video conference with Hamid Karzai every two weeks, left. He used to stress upon the need for the American role in rebuilding Afghanistan and its civilian institutions.
Officials say that the Obama government works with the state leaders rather than the central government.
The officials say that it will pressure Karzai to increase the war against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing fresh elections this year, and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his group will support Karzai for presidency or not.
This statement of the American officials is not a precursor for a change in the American policy towards Afghanistan, is it?
Is Hamid Karzai's rule coming to an end?
What is your opinion about this?
In a series of three one day matches between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2-1.
Pakistan had defeated Sri Lanka in the first match, but Sri Lanka was victorious in the remaining two matches.
In the third one day match, the national cricket team's performance was very poor. In response to Sri Lanka's 309 runs, it only managed to hit 75 runs in 23 overs before going all out. As such, it faced a humiliating loss.
The results of the series show the inconsistency of our cricket team's performance.
Despite having the home team advantage, the National team was defeated. Can you give the reasons for this defeat?
Which area of the team needs more attention of in order to improve?
Are you satisfied with team selection?
Which area is the major reason for the loss: fielding, batting or bowling.
Kindly share your opinion.
Malik Babar Hussain, it's sad that such ignorance still exists in this modern age. These feuds target the poor and innocent people. Who will believe that they are Muslims?
If a tribal chief proved his innocence by walking on fire, why doesn't the government take action?
When will judicial justice play its role?
The Sri Lankan team has reached Pakistan to play a one day series.
Besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
Upon reaching the Karachi airport, the Srilankan team was very warmly welcomed.
Two days between Pakistan and Srilanka in Karachi whereas the third one day will be played in Lahore.
Both teams have there claims over bowling, batting and fielding.
If the Srilankans are proud of their spinners, the Pakistanis trust their fast bowlers.
Srilankan Captain Mahela Jayvardena has said that it is not a single player from Pakistan team but the whole team is dangerous.
Murli dharan and Mendis will be the trump cards whereas the Pakistan Captain says that it will be a tough competition.
Shoaib Malik has said that we have played Murli dharan and we'll see Mendis as well. We have prepared a secret game plan and we shall implement that.
Will the Pak-Srilanka Series be really as interesting and exciting as expected?
Who will dominate the series between Pakistan and Srilanka?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the forerunner of the series?
Let us know your recommendation.

These are all the same people from Kashmir that have been fighting for their freedom for the last 60 years.
no one ask about that now they have stuck with fundamentalism and fight for terrorism so they now start talking about deal.
First, they killed Muslims brutally, and now they are trying to resolve issues.
Although Pakistan has to understand their two-way policy.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating this situation to distract the worlds attention away from the Kashmir issue.
But Pakistan has always showed the true face of India to the world
Now the British government has realized that the Indian government is maligning Pakistan for terrorism so that it can occupy Kashmir.
They are unwilling to talk with the Pakistan government on this matter
British foreign minister David Miliband said that by resolving the Kashmir issue this will end extremism. Pakistan government will then be able to handle the border issues.
It should be noted that American president Obama has already expressed similar views on the Kashmir issue.
The British foreign minister has said while talking to media in Mumbai and also written an essay that the idea of war on terror is wrong. On the basis of threat to oneself, killing others was Bush's policy.
David Miliband has said that Pakistan should show leniency towards extremist groups.
Due to the insistence of major powers, to resolve the Kashmir issue, India is creating unrest in the region to distract the world from this issue.
Terrorist attack in Mumbai is also a part of this strategy.
Does India want the allegations of terrorism its escape goat to avoid peace talks?
Tell us your opinion.
Usman Aftab
In my opinion a lot of the powerful nations do not want to bring harm to Pakistan.
They are thinking of plans to keep it in their control because they know that Pakistan is a strong nuclear power.
They want to fuel a situation that could begin a revolution.
Other nations are thinking that by cornering Pakistan they may face Geographical Political problems. They want to aid Pakistan, but they also want to accomplish their ulterior motives.

Indians have known to be snakes in the grass.
In my opinion they get cramps every now and then which causes them to give baseless threats.
The Indian army chief should keep his mouth shut. Either way we are ready. We know to give you a solid answer.

This is a very hurtful incident that Israel is publicly massacring the Palestinians; the same situation is here in Kashmir but the Security Council does not even bother with it.
As many organizations who are in Palestine and Kashmir should continue their fight till freedom and by creating unity between themselves keep fighting every kind of aggression, one of these days their Martyr will bring result. By the will of Allah
Israeli air attacks still continue in Gaza, as now several Palestinian Men, Women and children have been murdered.
Important political leader Hamas Nazarian has been martyred with his wife and kids.
Their meeting of the Security Council ended without any decision.
The condemning resolution presented by Libia and other Arab countries against Israel is facing American opposition in the meeting.
The civilian population of Philistine is under attack by the Israeli Air force for last many days.
The world showed strong reaction over the Mumbai attacks but no one, including Great Britain and the U.S., is reacting to the violence of Israel.
Why are the leading Muslim countries silent?

I think the problem lies in the illiteracy of our nation. People do not know how their money is spent. Govt. is solving its problems by introducing new taxes. The power and gas crisis will remain unsolved
Everybody knows the real faces of the peoples' elected representatives.
The power crisis has become worse in Pakistan.
On the other hand, the price of gas has been increased by 18%. Due to unavailability of petrol, people are facing severe difficulties.
The business and industrial communities of Pakistan are violently protesting against the power and gas crisis.
The producers have given the ultimatum to close the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is perturbed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
The production life cycle has become practically paralyzed.
The government institutions are blaming each other to explain their stances.
Are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas a joke against the nation?
Why is attention not being paid to solve the problems?
Are the wheels of national development not seeming jammed to the government?
What immediate steps can you suggest to gain control over this crisis?
Let us know your opinions.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that they are giving such difficulty to the public who has called for a democratic government.
The the lack of available electricity, gas and petrol has become torturous.
There is no control over government institutions.
The law and order situation is getting worse, day to day. May Allah have mercy on this country.
The New Year started.
The previous year was a year of protests and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered for terrorism.
The removal of President Musharraf from power, and President Bush's eight year regime coming to an end, Bush getting shoes thrown at him, the establishment of a democratic government in Pakistan, sudden calamities, the earthquake of Balochistan, the global financial crisis and depression.

The first anniversary of Benazir Bhutto Shaheed's death is being remembered. She was martyred on the 27th of December in 2007 before a congregation at the Liaqat Bagh in Rawalpindi.
Though Benazir no longer lives among us, she is remembered as a statesman, politician and world famous personality with a unique status in national politics.
Though one year has passed, the mystery of her death remains unsolved
Still, her work in the government and efforts to bring democracy to Pakistan have not been in vain.
Today, Pakistan has a democratic government with her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, serving as president.
How do you see the role of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan politics?
Which hand is behind the killing of her?
Recently she has been awarded by the Human Rights Organization for her work in politics and democracy.
President Bush, after completing his eight years tenure from the government, he reached the Presidential Camp Office Camp David to have the White house decorated according to the wish of President Barack Obama.
In the eight years tenure of President Bush, America has witnessed the historical attacks on the World trade Center and its destruction, the Pentagon attack and the wake of war against terrorists entered in to military invasion in Afghanistan and Iraq and dragging different countries into this war and using American resources on it became the memorable things.
Due to this war, America has faced a historically economic crisis.
Has this war resulted in benefit or loss for the world?
Was the policy of President bush was successful?
What is your opinion on President Bush's tenure?
The Indian Government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The India cricket team is scheduled to play three tests, five one day and one 20-20 match on its Pakistan tour.
Vice president of the Indian Cricket Board, Mr. Ragiv Shukla, told Geo News that he has sought permission for a tour of Pakistan from the Indian government, but due to current tensions between the two counties, the tour has been cancelled.
Is the Indian Government's initiative not to allow the cricket team to visit Pakistan on grounds of political reasons justified? Can't sports be kept aside from politics?
Is the Indian Government's decision counter productive for cricket?
Despite security concerns, if the English team visited India, then why can't the Indian team continue its tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion is this regards?
Salman from Karachi
Those people should feel proud to visit India.
To direct or produce their videos in India should open their eyes to what response India is giving.
I remember an interview with Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not a Pakistani national but a British one.
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan at the first opportunity because he was not honored there, either.

After the Mumbai attacks, the mode of the Indians has changed.
Jagjeet Singh reacted by expressing his hatred for Pakistan and Pakistanis.
It should be known that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsle and how has he become helpless now. Adnan Sami should stay in India; there is no need for him to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Aalam,
I will only say so much about Jagjeet Singh: that he changes colors like a chameleon.
And speaks on the occasion. Pakistanis, open your eyes and see how much you are respected in India! Do not be dull-minded.
After the Mumbai incident, their hate-filled speech has increased. Now they are spreading poison about famous singer Adnan Sami.
according to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said ""You dog this is a farewell kiss""
after this the journalist removed his shoe and threw it at Bush. President Bush saved himself and expertly ducked before the shoe couldstrike him.
The second shoe hit the American Flag.
Security personnel dragged the journalist away from the room.
At this point, President Bush stated that he didn't know why he had done so, the shoe was a size ten 10 I had no problem.
Do you think this reaction of the journalist was an expression of deprecation for President Bush from the Iraqi people?
What is your impression of this incident?
The tension between Pakistan and India's relations after the terrorism in Mumbai became intensified when fighter planes from the Indian Air Force violated the Pakistani airspace in the Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
As a result of the retaliation from Pak Air Force, the Indian planes were forced to go turn around.
Sources confirm that both Indian planes were loaded with ammunition.
This is the first incident of its kind in the current situation.
The Pakistani Air Force has confirmed that they are prepared to defend their country.
Federal Minister of Information Sherry Rehman has stated that the Indian leaders have acknowledged the violation of Pakistani airspace, although the incident happened by mistake.
Pakistan's military sources have declared that this is a grave transgression.
Do you think India really intends to launch an air raid on Pakistan?
Is India's claim true about the violation of Pakistani airspace being a mistake, or is India trying to cover up an attempt made to analyze the capability of the Pakistan Air Force?
Will this incident cause an increase in tension between the two countries?

It is true that it was determined but we remember it also that how many non criminal persons they murdered?Upon it she has proud that Nasirullah Babur did a good deed today.
But she changed completely afterward.
But it is also true that she ignored the candor of her political party and chose her son to be the representative of the People's Party. How is that democratic?
Juma Noor, Karachi. This proved the Quranic proverb that unbelievers help unbelievers.
Until the metal of the axe has a handle attached, it cannot chop off the wings.
Our leaders have a idea of this, which they are using to make secret plans.
God help our leaders.
The United Nations Security Council added the names of Hafiz Saeed and 3 other Pakistanis along with the Jamat Al Dawa and 5 other groups onto the Terrorists list.

Are these sanctions the result of Indian propaganda?
Why does India make claims about this agency for the Mumbai blast without any proof?
Are the terrorism agencies are not in India?
Does the UNO have the knowledge for the blasts that occurred in India?
