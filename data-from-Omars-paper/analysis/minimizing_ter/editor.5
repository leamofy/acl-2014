Abstention from dieting in order to avoid Flu.
This research from the American Scientists has come up after the experiments on rats.
It has been proven by experiments that rats put on diets with fewer calories were more prone to the Flu virus.
Research has proven the old myth  of fasting during fever wrong.
According to scientists, one should eat a lot during fever.
The researchers from Michigan State University say that the rats that were dieting were not as able to resist the infection, and their chances of dying had increased.  Whereas rats on normal diets had better resistance against the Flu virus.
In many modern countries it has for sometime been fashionable to think that, by free education for all-whether rich or poor, clever or stupid- one can solve all the problems of the society.
But we can already see that free education for all is not enough; we find in such countries a far larger number of people with University degrees than there are jobs for them to fill.
The Plan of Education Implemented in 1990.
Because of their degrees, they refuse to do what they think low work and in fact work with the hands is thought to be dirty and shameful in such countries.
The work of a completely uneducated farmer is far more important than that of a professor: we can live without education, but we die if we have no food. If no one cleaned our streets and took the rubbish away from our houses, we should get terrible diseases in our towns.
In fact, when we say that all of us must be educated to fit us for life, it means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited.
Education is not an end but a means to an end. In other words we do not educate children only for the purpose of educating them.
When men become organized in to very large groups, civilization develops.
It is possible to get freedom from hunger, thirsty, cold, heat and many diseases, so that each person can live a happier life than he could.
It means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited to his brain and ability, and secondly, that we can realize that all jobs are necessary to society and that it is very bad to be ashamed of ones work or to scorn someone else.

Protest against the removal of journalists
On Tuesday, the organization of journalists, RIUJ, held protests in front of the Islamabad Press Club of Journalists and Newspaper Workers against media owners and the government about the news channel and newspapers removing many of their employees.
Speaking to the protesters, a senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, the Federal Union of Journalists,  C.R. Shamsi said, "The politicians who protested with us yesterday on the streets, today, have become rulers and are sitting in Parliament. Out of fear of a certain lobby of media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of journalists."
He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices houses of punishment and beggar camps, where despite their earnings of millions of Rupees per year, their workers are given meager wages, and by removing hundreds of said workers, they are killing them economically.
An example of this is before us, in the case of a worker for Channel 5, a private TV station in Lahore, who committed suicide after not receiving his salary for four months. Even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.
He said that there should be firm measures taken against the TV and newspaper owners, and the journalists should establish a protest camp in front of Parliament to fight for their rights.
C.R. Shamsi criticized the governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, saying that employees were removed from the staff of his Urdu Newspaper 'Aaj Kal' without prior notice.
Whereas Junah Daily, Khabrein Daily, Channel 5, Burns Plus TV and Aaj TV have removed dozens of workers.
Speaking to the protestors, the General Secretary of PUFJ said that today, throughout the country, journalist organizations will be observing a "black day" against the removal of journalists and newspaper workers, during which journalists will go to the Parliamentary session wearing black bands on their arms in an act of protest to get back their rights.
According to Mazhar Abbas, they had receiver reports of 50% of Pakistani newspapers and TV channels in which the workers and journalists were being exploited, working without any agreement or contract.
He said that until now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been removed from newspapers and TV channels, and the current fear is that the owners will remove hundreds more in the present year while blaming it on the present financial crisis.
Mazhar Abbas has said that the journalists' movement will continue unless the dismissed workers are allowed to return. Implementation of the seventh wage board responsible for determining the wages of employees of news papers and release of salaries of TV channels and newspaper employees' blocked since many months.

In the members assembly, 240 votes were drawn in favor of this package, while 160 were drawn against it.
This economic revival plan will be presented next week in the Senate, where the ruling Democratic party has very little majority.
Concern is being expressed that great opposition from the Republican party may not make it easy for Senate approval.
After the economic revival plan was approved by the members assembly, Barrack Obama urged members to look past political differences, and work together on this plan.
President Obama said that this plan, which he was hopeful would become law by next month, will prove to create a peaceful atmosphere in the country, which will stimulate the American economy.
According to this plan, working-class people will be relieved of 275 billion dollars worth of debt, and 540 billion dollars will be paid for roads, bridges, schools, unemployment allowance and research for new technology.

They insisted on the bill proposed by their party in which attention has been given to reduced taxes.
They said that through their package, less investment is required to create more chances of livelihood.
They said that instead of construction plans, reduced taxes can create more jobs instantly.
Bitterness among Israeli president and Turkish Prime Minister
Rajab Tayyab Erdogan almost shouted at Israeli President and said that the blood of many people has been shed in Gaza. He felt sorrow watching that people can actually applaud this military action from Israel.
Mr. Erdogan said that, "I think you are using such words to erase your guilt and that in a high voice. But you killed people and I am remembering those children who were killed near the shore."
Shamoon Parez said that Gaza's pain is not Israel, but that it is instead Hammas who has founded a dangerous dictatorship there.
A correspondent of BBC from Davis said that nothing like this has been seen before in an international economic forum.
Although, Erdogan said later that he respects the Israeli president and also his age due to which he did not shout at him but what he was saying was miles away from truth.
Turkey is one of the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, but for the last few years there has been tension between them.
The attacks were not planned in Pakistan.
Speaking to Indian news channel NDTV, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said that the report of the Pakistani investigations into the Mumbai blast will be prepared soon.
In the attacks that took place in Mumbai last Novemeber, more than 170 people were killed.
India claims that extremist group Lashkar-e-Taiba is responsible for the attacks.
India also said that Pakistani "state factors" were responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
The Mumbai attacks affected relations between the two countries.
High commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan gave his first statement about the report of the Pakistani investigations, from which it becomes evident as to what is within the report.
Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that as far as the investigation has deteremined, Pakistani land has not been used.
It must be some other place, not England.
These were the two places about which I was in doubt: Pakistan and Britain.
India and the global brotherhood has put considerable pressure on Pakistan to take action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan says that it has arrested dozens of people during the action against groups which were clearly involved in the Mumbai attacks.
Wahid Shamsul Hasan said, "We are not trying to cover this up."
We believe in acting upon facts.
Our investigations will be accepted by the world.
We will try to satisfy India with the results [of the investigation].
Defending the delay in the Pakistani investigations, he said that to gather, understand and verify such matters takes time.
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that India took 45 days to hand over its dossier.

Umer Abdullah said he will play his role in patching up talks between Indian government and separation supporters. However, until the Indian elections and before the new government is elected, this will be difficult.
The European Union's role in Peace in the Middle East
Looking it from the government's point of view, the efforts by the European Union to stop the war in the Middle East have been decisive.
According to Brussels official position, the Shoarzan Berg group or Sarkozy's efforts are symbolic of the seriousness of the matter.
The European Commission's Spokeman, Amadeu Altafa, said that every effort is commendable and a unified message from the European Union can reach the warring sides.
In light of the government's statement all seems to be fine.
In reality the European Union is presenting a view of conflict amongst each other on this idea and that is very sad.
The European Union's President says the Czech Republic's role is already weak.
In addition to it, the internal turmoil has nullified the effect.
On the other hand, the French President's role seems to indicate he is still working as the president of the European Union.
This is despite the fact that France has expired its 6 month Presidential term.
Sarkozy wants to play a leader's role and he can, but he lacks the authorization.
The most funny situation is faced by the French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner.
He is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of Czech republic Schwarzenberg.
The problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the Middle East war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right of self defense whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. moreover Germany has sent its special ambassador to Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance, it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.
The proof for this is,  Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.
this is a golden chance for the European Union to do something, since America; due to the policies of George W. Bush has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial Crisis: German industrialist billionaire commites Suicide
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany left a huge business group behind him.
but a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 and  one billion euro loan it needed immediately , so Merkle went into deep pressure.
Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had gone from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic power.
After the death of his father, Adolf Merkel took over his family business. He developed it quick, putting it on new lines.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm,the  Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm, always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine."
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the management of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have sanctioned 400 million Euros in floating loans for his group. But under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.
Therefore after Adolf Merkeley's demise the Merkeley Group which once existed came to an end.
According to new statistics the crime rate among the immigrants in Germany if compared with other countries between 2004 and 2007 dropped from 22.9% to 21.4%.



In the view of Joachim Herrmann the minister for home affairs of Baaveria it has been a positive change.
He said: "It is to be noted that the number of aspirants seeking German citizenship has increased."
The statistics would have mentioned the fact that most of the persons indulging in the crimes are Germans.
Based on this a foreigner said "when statistics of crime was taken in his homeland in 2010 the above mentioned factors will be taken for consideration by Herrmann".
Mentions have been made in his letters about Humberg except Baaveria.
Christoph Ahlhaus, an internal affair's senator belong to CDU, said, ""When one does research in a scientific manner, then the results can not be predetermined. The results are based on the figures and numbers which are the outcome of the research.
Ahlhaus brought the attention towards an analysis report of 2006 prepared by a regional (provincial) office of Crime Prevention, in view of which it was calculated that in the crimes happening from bergdorf to hamburg, what is the percentage of foreigners involved.
From the results it was found out that the foreigners'
crime percentage is less compared to the overall crime rate of the whole province.
In contrast to this calculation, when in 2006 in Berlin, the teenage crime rates were analyzed, it was found that the teenagers witha foreign background was 7.44%
was 7.44 %
However certain political parties of Germany for example SPD, the environmentalist party The Greens, and the Left party Linkspartei (Die Linke), are against the idea of collecting information about whether certain German citizens are foreigners or not, at the same time as collecting facts about crimes and crime rates.

Israel is committing massacre by slaughtering children, women and common people and America's President is praising him. This is the humanity and freedom the America that the world is witnessing in Gaza and other parts of the world.

why reduce exercise with the age?
new research
Exercise at any age is good for health.
It energizes your heart, reduces the cholesterol level, helps in keeping the weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer's or dementia.
Unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.
Experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.
Dr. Patricia Palecca, of Mayo Clinic Minnesota, says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to exercise and lack of bodily activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.
She lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.
The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart.
The pumping of the blood by the heart - its contraction and relaxation - was studied.
The experts focused on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood.
They learned that as people grew older there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.
Dr. Patricia says that as age increases the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear and this affects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garwin Cain was also a part of this study.
He says that they were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this and that this clearly proves how deep of a relationship there is between the decrease of exercise and the relaxation of the heart.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart disease.
If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart they can achieve the benefits of exercise, despite the increase in age.
A detailed report of this has been published in the magazine of the American Medical Association.
There are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief.
The chief of the Indian Army, General Deepak Kapoor, has stated that there is no chance of immediate war with Pakistan. However, to serve the country and protect its interests, they are always ready.
General Kapoor has made the accusation that despite ascertainments and the international pressure on Pakistan due to the Mumbai attacks, the terrorists structure is not only the same in Pakistan, but it is also active.
He said this in an interview to journalists in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day trip to the Kashmir valley to inspect the situation of the overall security, which is under New Delhi's management, and to check the preparations of the armed forces at the border.
He was asked about the Mumbai attacks and his reaction to the media reports which state that Pakistan refuted the proof presented by India.
He stated, "The matters of peace and war are decided by the political leadership."
Talking about the presence of the skeleton of terrorism on the land of Pakistan,he said allegedly, that India would fight against such people who are ready to destroy peace and weaken India.
He said that there are around 7 to 800 fighters presented on the land of Indian Kashmir from which almost 50% were foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that only with the betterment in the weather, the efforts of encroachment between Pakistan and Kashmir under its government could be increased,  although India has increased security on the boarders.
They have refused to the possibility of reduction in the number of army soldiers in Indian Kashmir by stating that one can not compromise over the country's security.
May God answer the world's prayers and may Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, but we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan , effected by this change, are in our favor.
That is what Mr. Barrack Obama will give to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams.
The oath taking of Obama as the president of America, whose part of the name is also Hussain, is where historically important in all the ways, is also a great challenge for the history.
Not only for himself but also for those who supported him with all their hearts.
This challenge will also be for the white majority as it is not easy for them to accept that a colored man is ruling over them.
Those here in South Asia, especially the Muslims, who have hopes about him, should remember that he was elected the president of America, and Obama should remember that the president of America is actually the president of the world.
A little while back, a person whose real brothers were brought to America from their own countries, wearing the neckband of slavery, and whose blood and sweat watered the roots of the strongest country of the new era, today are representative of that very same targeted lineage that will be called the 44th President.
Many people have many expectations from this man.
It is necessary for those who admire him that they do not make unrealistic expectations about him.
If Obama is even successful in somewhat reducing the hate that is spread on lineage and religion-based lines, it will be a victory for his admirers.
What effect will this change have on South Asia, and what considerable change can be expected in American policy in this regards?
How will these changes affect Pakistani-American relations?
?
My Sir, whether it be Obama or someone else, the type of policies with regards to the whole world, is decided by the multi-billion, influential, strong Jewish lobby.
As for Pakistan, with regards to the recent Mumbai blasts, the injurious actions taken by India, Israel and America have been seen by the whole world.
Even after the creation on Pakistan, the governance of Swat was in the hands of its own King who even had his own army and law.
With the help of an agreement, they transferred the administration of Swat to the Pakistan government.
But it's disheartening to know that our government treated Swat in the same way a step mother would treat another person's child.
After the end of the governance of the King there were no more schools founded in Swat.
The areas of development were not given any notice.
Currently the number of girls acquiring education is far less than that of previous years.
The Taliban are continuing their attacks on educational institutions in the NWFP.
Swat has suffered the highest number of schools destroyed and the majority of them have been girls schools.
Not just that-the Taliban have also announced a ban on education for girls.
Thousands of students are being deprived of their rightful education.
What are your views about stopping girls' education and how it affects the the goals Taliban want to achieve?
The big question people are asking is, Why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities so far?
What actions do you think the government should take to stop these illegal activities.
The question should be that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will work on solutions to the Taliban illegal activities.
Because the people of Swat believe that the game Army is corrupt and is there to serve the Taliban and not to kill or capture them. Otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and all the bombings occur during the hours of Curfew. How come such atrocities such as; people being beheaded and people being hanged in the center of a crossroad during the hours of Curfew?
When the writ of the government is not being carried out and enforced, how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities?
Now brings about the question why would have an armed force; armed with modern weapons, technologies and intelligence system that does not give the government the upper hand over the enemy.
The only answer is that there is an alternate force and corruption within the government that prevents the capture or killing of Taliban insurgents.
The resulting discussion is that the Taliban with their wrong steps are making it easier for the imperialists to push Western Democracy on the people of Afghanistan.
Fifteen years before the war was continued in Afghanistan the Russians were driven out of the country using arms and tactics from the West.
The ISI used to control the Taliban when there was opposition from the Northern Alliance, which was supported by Russia, India, and Iran.
Then, suddenly, the situation changed and the Taliban's works came to light.
ISI also got an offer of dollars from America, so the previous friend became an enemy.
Now the situation has changed, but the war is still going on and the countries supporting them in Pakistan are still Russia, India, and Iran.
Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.
For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, that it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, then that person will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, it will receive punishment for that and will continue to play with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings.
The question is whether or not war, armed resistance, and terrorism are the solution to problems?
If not, then what is the magic recipe that will bring out a solution to the problems?
This war is not right. It is destructive and increase our problems rather than solve it.
Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq should adopt these models in order to get their Independence, much like how Nelson Mandela freed his beloved country.
to fight more for socially and ethically, rather than with arms.
kashmiri's participation in election shows that they have accepted his point.
Israeli attacks have gone on for 3 weeks and the death toll have reached 1000.
world diplomacy efforts have not resulted in cease fire until now.
an according to a survey , after the dec. 27 attacks, 90,000 Palestine left their homes and moved to a safer place.
on the other hand, NGOs has accused Israel for not taking care of Palestinian children and added that these children will have serious phsycological and emotional problems.
What have you to say??
what do you think should to be done?
How is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Taliban should be given a chance.
basit, Peshawar
Please wakeup! If the Taliban start doing the real Jihad, who will be responsible for killing innocent people.
Who will burn down the girl's schools?
Who will do kidnapping for ransom.  If the ransom is not paid, who will blame people of being American agents and hang them on the towers?
These Taliban have brought created more damage to Islam that no nation or religion has ever created.

If the whole Muslim world just give a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see  how upset its father, America, will be.
Immediately, not only talks on ceasefire, but ceasefire will really happen as well.
But what can be done? Where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from?
Someone tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step, as he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
The responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on Arabs and the Muslim world but its an  obligation of the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny.
This unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
Just like in Pakistan and India, before June 30th or the end of the fiscal year, the government institutions were looted. The American regime, just before its end, have given a green signal to Israel to do what ever it wants.
America says that effort will be made for ceasefire.
On the other hand, the United Nation is passing one resolution over another but both have done practically nothing. This means that the United Nations is also working  to crush the Muslims.
All the Islamic Countries should cancel their membership in United Nations and they should lay the foundation of their own international organization.
Many examples are in front of us where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations came forward and only the Muslims suffered.
What is the advantage of these actions when BBC does not have to print anything?
Now where have the principles of journalism been buried when the unrequired blood, especially of the Muslims, starts flowing and the ghost of unbiased reporting starts riding over the BBC?
It otherwise portrays itself as a flag bearer of righteousness.
Saying something from their side is a far away thing when they do not even want comments.
It is from the Muslims.
The difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims and people like you live among Muslims.
[syja786]
Long time since, in the forums of BBC, a specific cult has been targeted sometimes in suicide attacks and sometimes in terrorism happening in India.
Extremism is the favorite word for those anti-Islamic comments.
But by viewing the above comment, you can easily differentiate who is the actual extremist, in which almost a Fatwa of blasphemy has been pronounced for writing against Iran.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal cannot be fought with the help of sword?
After watching Israel's bombings on unarmed people, what would one's tear-filled heart do?
But the actual blame should go to terrorism and violence, which we state as Jihad and ruin the beautiful name of Islam.
Since the majority of Palestinians have already accepted the existence of Israel, does it make sense for Hamas to fire rockets on Israel or do suicide attacks.
Behavior from both side lacks humanity.
The character played by America and United Nations again showed us their support for the cruelties of Israel.
May Allah grant us, the Muslims, a way to re-unite. Amen.
And the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism.  After all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal presence? And everyone knows who these controllers are.
So in this situation, in common terms, it is called DADAGEERI, which means: do whatever you can.
That it even hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry.
Medicines for the injured and coffins for the dead are being supplied by the Arab leaders and asked that
Should the Israeli attacks take place?
This is the actual problem: that the leaders of Muslim countries, including the Saudi crown prince, are deluded. They neither have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid, they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
They should take immediate measures against Israel.
for example, stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Salam to all brothers and sisters!
I think at this hard time, advising Hammas to stop struggling in the name of peace, would be unjustified. With thousands of widows and millions of orphans, and it would be similar to prove them wrong.
If Israel and its followers are at peak of cruelty, then soon a revolution to stop all this is going to show up. This is the law of nature. America and Isreal's steps are bringing suicide bombers.
They can can not understand. They are blind in a trance of power.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Now Hammas and Israel should become friends to stop blood shed.
Muhammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France.
Very rightly said.
Assuming Hammas is 100% right and by fighting against malice it gets higher place in the eyes of God, even then, at least, they should realize if by good deeds, peace in others home is shattered, then that act is no longer a good deed.
Those who claim to love God, His Prophet(P.B.U.H) and their religion,then to love humanity is part of their belief.
Consequently, after muslims confiscation of everybody on earth is Allah's order.
Najibur Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
There are no orders to destroy them, but they are invited to come to Islam.
However, Jihad has ordered against those who have conspiracies against their religion.
These people should be fought, unless they stop the conspiracies. Although, this doesn't mean that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering.
For all my brothers, the only end to the killer of innocent children is destruction.
I have asked my friends about the Israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past, about how they become so strong today and how about why they don't listen to any one? He stated that this is because the Jews are united.
There are no Shea's and Sunnis. They are just Jews and they have developed everything in every field.
In contrast, what is the condition of 55 Islamic countries?
These countries are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them to the point that they are just waiting for their death.
It is essential that all Muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better strategy than to recognize Israel, learn through modern education the means of progress, and let the world live in peace and harmony.
The Muslims have plenty of land and resources as well.
The need is for proper usage.
This first most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque.  This was impossible without removing Yasin and Arafat.
The world is witnessing how Palestine has been scattered  after the death of these two leaders.
And it's noticing how the Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
In 1974 a Pakistani prime minister was so trusted by the world that for the first time in history he managed to gather all the Muslim leaders under one roof with a hundred percent attendance.
Today, on his 81st birthday, the whole nation promises the very difficult task of seeking unity.
Will the incomplete mission of forming a joint Islamic nation will be advanced while still removing the differences between the Muslims?
This is a Jinn, which has been inside Palestine for half a century.
That Jinn has many different opinions.
Often this Jinn calls itself bad names from one of its other mouths to divert the attention and reduce the pressure put on it by other governments.
It is another mouth of this Jinn which is causing the unrest in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This Jinn fears Islam the most because it knows that whenever it is removed, only Islam, Mulsims, and the complete religion of Islam in its followers can remove it, as history proves that Islam has brought many Abu Jahls into practice.
The series of bombings of Gaza by Israeli war planes and missile strikes has been going on since the 27th of December.
More than three hundred Israeli citizens have died so far in these attacks.
Now, after the air strikes, Israeli tanks have reached the Gaza border in preparation for a land offensive.
The Security Council of the United Nations, through an agreed  resolution passed in an emergency meeting, have demanded that Israeli and Palestinian authorities stop extremist activities immediately.
However, the Israeli authorities say that they will continue the operation in Gaza until they make sure that the rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
In your opinion, is this claim of Israel true, that it's doing all this for defending the sovereignty of Israel?
Is the community playing its role in such situation?
Does this aggression have an indirect relation to the coming elections in Israel?
Can any improvement be expected in the situation in the Middle East after the succession of the newly elected American President Barak Obama?

The BBC makes it a point to dig out and publish such accounts.
After all, they have to maintain the illusion of neutrality.
By the way, BBC news is factual, but an essential factor is the tone in which the news is delivered.
Which news to be made prominent and which news to be considered as insignificant.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
Now even the electronic media and printed media of Pakistan, specifically a few Urdu newspapers and columnists, are not behind anybody else in exhibiting this skill-- who, while giving coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism, and while writing about it, hide facts about the grudge mafia.
It has been said that the United Nations seemingly supports human rights and peace but actually the Muslims are being subjected to extreme levels of cruelty and brutality. And what we hear from the United Nations is that Hamas should stop the attacks. How long will this hypocrisy carry on?
Why there is so much atrocity committed on Muslims. If people like Americans are backing up the Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So, Americans, if you have courage then stop supporting them and see then what their fate is.
So-called writers and murderers in name of peace should understand that peace in the world can only be obtained through justice not through genocide.
If any nations perish through genocide and results of choice can be obtained then after actions of Hitler, existence of Jews and their uprising was impossible.
As poet says.
Atrocity is atrocity, it vanishes when it rises.
Blood is blood, clots when drop.
Now who will tell whom what is terrorism?
Is this comes in terrorism, why? because own pain is only felt.
Other people are not humans or blood of Muslims is so cheap or color of these innocents' blood was not red?
And now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere?
I saw the terror act of Mumbai attacks as my own house was set on fire. It is painful to see the sufferings of humanity.   if such sufferings can not be seen by others. May the Muslims think collectively.
Dead bodies on the roads, helpless and wounded people stained with their own blood. How it should be condamned; words are too poor to express this condemnation.
My heart is crying over the miseries and helplessness of Muslims. On one hand People are being killed in India and on the other hand, without any solid proof, whole world is pressing Pakistan to do more or we will do it ourselves.
On the other side Israel is killing Muslims. The silence of the world is intolerable.
It may be delayed but God will surely do the justice to end the dominance of falsehood.
A threat to Israel's security in the presence of United States, no way! it is a joke.
In Israel, such tactics are used by ruling party to achieve public support.Historically no president was powerful enough to change American policies.Barrack Obama is no exception. Forces of Exploitation are similar in their character; whether they are black or white.
In this forum discussion, it is clear that every body is mourning the death of Benazir but she is not forgiven for her political mistakes.
It is debatable whether Benazir died for democracy or for the lust of Power.
If Democracy was her motto then why did not she come before American clearance and deal? Whey did she leave democracy under the control of Musharraf's dictatorship for 10 years?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the public needed her. Unfortunately, she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised.
When each and every historic personality is being accused, there is no one to say anything about this.

How brutal is our nation?  Not only we are blind while writing odes on ourselves and our parties, but now we are picking, accusing and criticizing every historical scholar and no body is there to say any thing about it.
Enough of development that we have made.
Sana Khan
Few things are ignored just by thinking that nothing can be done with them. Just like a donkey can not become a scholar by just loading books onto it.
Because of the Mumbai attacks, there has been a setback in the dialog between Pakistan and India.  However, Pakistan and India should continue these dialogs.
If we talk of war then it will bring loss of life on both sides.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu.  On the other hand, when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer.  Shortly afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader; point to be noted.
First of all Merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and to all the Christian brothers of the forum.
Greeting to all friends of the Forum: Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida and Mr. Akram.
We want flowers of peace rather in the flame of war.
War is, itself, a problem.
What solution will the war give?
Today, will give Fire and blood.
Tomorrow, will give hunger and necessity.
For this wise people,
it is better that war keeps postponing.
In your and our garden.
It is better that candle keeps lit.
The relationship of India and America have become deep and India knows that when the time comes America will openly deceive Pakistan.
It is the old history of America.
However, America will gain its aims in the Indian attack and the India will bear all the costs.
Pakistan should announce clearly that they will not attack first, but if the first attack comes from India then there will be no peace until India will be abolished and occupied andd there will be on one to  care for all our killing.
It is the Islamic history
.  Before this approval, Pakistani public and force spoke for what they wanted.
The Indian efforts of receiving extra-ordinary ambassador and force benefits in fulfilling Mambai attacks are making It clever party mare than impress so after the first world hard opposite action decreased on Pakistan by the world.
The display to the United States and increasing status of the president of Interpol's peace of mind at Pakistani efforts by avoiding unnecessary noise of India is the side effect of the extra ambassador of India.
There are no two sayings about this dishonest action.
But the question is where was the Pakistani force and what was doing when thousands Talibans attacked at the village of Pir Same-u-Llah?
Should the contentedness of force not be in action that what they did was for their country.
Every day thousands of missiles and bombs has been detonated. How many Taliban citizens has been killed?
I am Requesting of ISI, for God's sake: leave the Guardianship of Taliban and let us live with peace and happiness in our Heaven.
And stop this fake Operation
In National Unity the day is not too far away when in Pakistan the military affirmative will be passed as it has been passed against jamiat-ul-dawa
Riyaz Ahmed Farooqui.
First our lovers of intemperance and their supporters are continuously collecting the evidence for legal action.  Any day affirmation comes through then there are many possibilities that in this National Unity there will be no one to speak up to voice support for us.
If supposing there is any delay for Affirmative to pass then we can keep an example of America in the forefront so that any one of  power will join us to walk with us.
We dont have the consciousness and knowledge of Peer Sami ul llah his personality and his adventures- and what work he was busy in,
probably he was not a revolutionary.
As Kamri Dach Gaveera, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr Najeeb ul llah and thousands of Revolutionarys Dead bodies has been disgraced by enemyhands
They are still in command after death.
There is an international game being played over here. They rule by scaring the public about beastliness and terror.
Would it be permissible for them to say that if we are not there, beasts and wild people will come and capture the government?
Such actions in the name of religion of the so-called Islam lovers is extremely disagreeable.
The supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of America, but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions, they give it the name of tribal traditions and avoid it.
Any person with a heart can never accept these beastly actions, done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions, while others are done in the name of Islam.
I think our army has joint these people.
When these people move around, some time will have to be taken. Catching them will only take so much time. But even if they were there, forget about that spot because they escape from there.
Are these people so brave that they take 50 or 70 people hostage and our army watches like an audience with hand on hand?
They, as well as the army, are also servants of Allah.
It is clear that something is sinister.
In Ziya-ul-Haqq's dictatorship, instead of presenting the Noble and Merciful characters of God, an atmosphere of anti-religion was created by the use of many types of narrations of punishments apart from the incident of the body hanging. Even the literature and books like, 'What will happen when we die?' created fear and terror.
These people are only using this fear as a tool or a weapon to gain worldly pleasures and honor.
Preachers!
As you have preached against the fire of Hell
that you have yourself become the face of fear.
It is surprising when it is said that this can not be a work of a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our own history or we ignore it for some reason.
Upon the death of the Prophet and refusing to pledge allegiance, who burnt the Messenger's daughter's door and pulled her husband out with a rope around his neck?
Did they come from somewhere outside?
Was the strike on Madeena and Great Karbala the work of Hindus and Jews?
Without the submission of the truth nor the movement was away neither the check.
BBC people close quadrant policy.
The title for this incident: "Was it legal or illegal to hit Bush with the shoes?"
It was meant to be.
Tahir Choudry, Japan
Friend, have some shame that a human being was taken from the grave and hung on a pole just because he raised his voice against the wrongdoing and you are only concerned about the box office title.
For the victory of the operation Sherdil and on the other side of the border the victorious invasion of the operation lion heart is dependable that on whose favor is the opinion of normal people.
Peer Sahib was the target of this conspiracy led by American and Pakistan agencies.
All the criticism is now going to be directed against the Taaliban because undercover people have infiltrated the Taaliban very successfully and they are taking steps to encourage normal people to change their opinions.
I only have one thing to ask - what were the police doing when that dead body was just hanging there the whole day? Are they in this country to kill normal civilians like these two children and their mother, who are dead thanks to Taliban bombing people's houses?
Were they not know about that chowk?
Or they were seeing an action film?
We say stop these stupid games, for Allah's sake.
At last there is a commander upon you also.
A question raised from BBS if it is not reasonable but alas on the sow thinking of writers,.for example it was asked from any person that for what purpose the force went Swaaat containing 30000 persons.
The dead bodies of the helpers of force fighting with the Taliban remained hanging on poles all day.
What did the Pakistani Force do to help the people of Swat? How did the media or the BBC or the world knowing about this do anything to help? It was not good.
The Pakistani Force is just making things up to sound worse.
Every child of Swaat is saying that this is a bloodbath.
Please stop this drama, for god's sake.
The Taliban has destroyed the name of Muslims.
If the pure Muslims of whole world tell them: as a Muslim, they wont get any place to live for the terror.
Those that are not interested in working and not interested in living peaceful life take guns and join those people.
Islam has not come under the pressure of guns or swords.
Shame on you.
There is no reason for this in any religion or in any family.
BBC, along with other media, has gathered information about the Taliban.
But the reality is not even known to anyone. That is the real situation. We only know because we are tribal.
Bssically, it is a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD, and our ISI, are involved. There is no one in from the Taliban or from tribal. Terror was created from the above agencies, who are insulting the Taliban, Islam, Madarsa's, Pestos, and Tribals
Because of this action Muslims had their heads down with shyness.
I salute MQM Leader Altaf Hussain, ANP and PPP leaders who are against this cancer it means united talks against Taliban.
This cancer created by Ziaulhaq, he left the government but, also desires to destroy Pakistan.
I am hopeful that a large number of the Pakistani leadership will work together to end this cancer within the nations government.
India after Mumbai the attack said that the attack was the work of Pakistani extremists.
Pakistan denies the blames and said it will give all possible assistance to India in interrogation.
India said that it will provide list to Pakistan officials that contains the names of the suspects linked to the extremist group believed to be responsible for the attacks in India.
Pakistan said that Jaish Muhammad Leader, Mulana Masood Azhar has gone into hiding and they did not have any information about him.
Before this list was given to Pakistan, the Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari did not want to receive information from western secret agencies and Indian government concerning evidence linking Pakistan to the  Mumbai attack.
President Zardari stated that no evidence proves that Ajmal Qasaab is a Pakistani National.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned Pakistan that its relation with India can not improve unless its land is being used for terrorism.
In a recent development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to Pakistan.
Should these political events affect sports?
What do you see as the future of Pakistan and India relations?
Neither America will break Pakistan nor India.
Pakistan will be broken by Pakistanis themselves.
This to be expected because of the widespread practices of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism.
Proof that  Jinnah also did not treat the Muslims of India so well has been evident over a period of time.
Yasmin, Chicago.
Madam, If  Mr. Jinnah's vision had been realized, neither the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism would have  spread in Pakistan nor would the Muslims in India have displayed such behavior.
It's our fault that we could not bring up a leader of his stature.
If we can not care for our heroes, then
this region has great capabilities.
God knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
In both countries, enemies of peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv sena, RSS have been raised.
The evil powers don't want this region to progress, therefore these countries are controlled like puppets.
Can you imagine what status this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world?
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
May Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
But sir, open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and reality on the ground, and you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
Other than that National matter are not looking good as well, circumstances in Sarhad, Balochistan, Karachi in Sindh are in front of you.
In this situation, the country needs a leader who can unite us as a single Nation.
O Allah, have mercy on us.
In my opinion, there is no way other than a last war.
Too much has happened.
Now this affair has to win or lose.
This problem will not be solved with hypocrisy and deceit.
And neither with small big terrorism in each other countries.
Even Europe rested after fighting the last great war.
And if this great war had not happened, then they  would be chattering like Pakistan and India.
Almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be stopped.
But our military leadership does not seem to be sincere in these regards. On the one hand, America and Europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism, and on the other hand we secretly help the Taliban.
We should think and fix our direction and choose only one side.
There is no doubt that the majority of the workers of Jama'athud Da'wah are the previous members of Lashkar-e-Taiba who joined the group called Jama'athud Da'wah Pakistan after Lashkar-e-Taiba was rendered inexistent.
However, after that, the members gave preference to social work.  Even now Jama'athud Da'wah was rendered inexistent by the United Nations due to the pressure applied by India and the crackdown being enforced by the Pakistani government.
I believe that if Jihadi groups leave religious fundamentalism and take up social efforts that would be better.
The present terrorist groups that bring up criminals in the name of Jihad, and the elders of these Mullas, are the same people who used to call Pakistan 'Palidistan', and other derogatory terms.
Now they are not leaving any stone unturned in the quest to destroy Pakistan.
These people are not even fit to be called human beings, let alone 'Muslims'.
Without cleaning Pakistan of these mischief mongers, the national security will remain at risk.
Can we still think about whether or not to put a ban on these trouble makers?
There is no place on earth for extremist Mullahs whose only work is to cause killings.
This news tore my heart.
What kind of world is this? In which it has become difficult for those who even take the name of one of the important parts of the religion of Allah, Islam.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims, but if a Muslim even tries to extract revenge, along with the whole non-Muslim world, even the hypocrite leaders join and treat those who have sincere religious feeling in the manner our great leaders are treating Hafiz Saeed.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-
Pak relationships turned sour, the proximity between the two countries forming after many years, has suffered a severe setback for the first time.
India has always claimed that militant and non-militant groups which are active in Pakistan were responsible.
For the relationships to return to normal; taking action against these countries is being made a prerequisite.
Whereas Indian security agencies have accused Lashkar-e-Taiba of being directly responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
The name of Jama'athud Da'wah also comes up many times in this regard.
This is not the first time that relationships between the two countries have become strained due to some terrorist activity that took place in India.
In December 2001, after the attack on the parliament, the two neighbors were prepared to go to war.
After that, Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned and it was included in the list of terrorist groups.
Now, it is being demanded that Jama'athud Da'wah, which according to security reports, is just a new form of Lashkar-e-Taiba, also be banned.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against the active fundamentalist groups within its boundaries?
Can putting a ban on Jama'athud Da'wah help the present Indo-
Pak crisis to subside, and how important is it for permanent peace between the two countries that armed groups be dismantled?
The Security Council of the United Nations has passed the ban on Jama'athud Da'wah. However, what proof did the Security Council have on which to base such urgency?
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency dealing with the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you think about it, even India has become an unsuccessful state.
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were brought to their knees by a few terrorists for three days. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is an uproar the whole world over. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when Mullahism rose in popularity in the religion, the people were divided into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salam: Please do it with pleasure but act on your own.
Do not do it under American pressure.
If India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
And why does it accuse us of everything?
There are extremist groups and organizations in India as well. Why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the world?
What India is doing in Kashmir, what is that?
What Israel is doing, what is that?
The truth is, we are the first nuclear Muslim state. Why is this the main issue?
Pakistan is now in last steps.
Kamran Hasan, Abu Dhabe
Your talk is near to the heart and situations are also like it.
Now the printed new map of Pakistan is shown in American newspapers and the round of punctuation is also a sign of it.
America is gripping more on Pakistan slowly day by day.
In this situation if we did not show union as a nation then there is possible another part as Bangla daish.
To show disatbleness of errorism is less where will be it in Mambae Hotal, Meriat hotal in Islamabad and in Falastin.
Like this terorrists should be punished where they will where from Pakistan, India, America or Israel.
Now the question is this that terorriss attacks on Pakistan and many bodies died by their attacks that what is the reason of scielence of the world.
Was the attack on Mariat hotal not by terorrists?
Then why?
Hats off to the Home Advisor, Mr. Rahman Malik. Masha Allah, has become so brave and courageous.
?
According to BBC, Mr. Malik has vehemently denied the accusation that the arrests of terrorists were being done at the 'request of others'.
Brother, Subhanallah!
Whether the ability is there or not, or whether it should be said that it is not needed.
We, i.e. Pakistan, are fighting somebody else's war.
And where are our own interests which we are trying so hard to save?
No one has the right to interfere in any country's affairs.
This does not seem to be the era of new populations.
If people expect justice or demand that an external united court be established to respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or military regime, there could be peace in the Third World, including Pakistan.
As such, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
And this causes more opposing feelings.
If they trust America and the United republics, then let them leave the style of new populations, and let them work on those lines, upholding the sovereignty of the state.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
In Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, security forces captured a camp of practically non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India's accusation is that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
United States Secretary of State, Condoleeza Rice told the Pakistani leadership that there should be immediate action taken against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack.
He said that the extremists whom attacked Mambae used Pakistani earth.
Meanwhile, Pashawar military officials report that unknown miltary personnel fired upon UN military trucks, destroying approximately 50 trucks.
It is the second attack on NATO and America.
Meanwhile, Pakistan made the show of disactive party Lashkar-e-Taiba and before this was tried to make miltary persons unmiltary and miltary wepons were changed with money and cartainly no any action without it.
The situations told that in the past period of President ZiaulHaq  the efforts of Pakistan to end of miltary parties in the result of enterance of Soviat Union in Afghanistan and the resistance by America funding did not succeed.
The question is, is this what Pakistan really wants to do?
Are Pakistan really capable of this?
What do you say?

I ask only one question from the flag holders of humanity.
If you kill their children and they bring necklace for you, this is impossible.
Saeed, Multan.
And question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies, say any logic, argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men, laborers and poor workers of different occupations, in revenge of American attack?
If answer is in no then you have an instant need of correcting your point of view.
People were armed, at that time their was a danger that Russia will turn toward Pakistan after Afghanistan, therefore people were armed.
Now when there is danger that America will overrun Pakistan through passage of Afghanistan of which American president had said out in his election campaign then why should we unarm these people?
Only because America or India army don't have to face any civil resistance after defeating Pakistani army?
Yes, if anyone of them is involved in any destructive actions then Pakistan should act against them.
But this is more, that government against Lashkar-e-Taiba proves correct by India that Pakistan is involve in that.
Najeeb Ul Rehman Saico, *Lahore*.
If except that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved than its still wrong to blame the Pakistani government.
And one question also arises that do these terrorist's have or get support of any Government or Indian government's insiders?
Are terrorist's only born and made in Pakistan and not made in India and rest of the world?
As far as Lashkar-e-Taiba is concerned they are not involved in this recent terror.
This recalls that Hafiz Saeed was the first person who called Taliban acts as 'Fitnah'.
This is my firm belief that the Taliban acts were a part of American projects so that every person or group are cleaned out from the way who challenge the Taliban in any manner.
Even support by the whole nation, to take action against the Lashkar-e-Taiba due to Indian pressure indicates Zardini's frustration and buttering nature.
Americans said to end this campagin which started from Saudi's funding. Ask them now to clean this dirt as well, which make our society polluted.
One should also protest against them that according to ethics, America and Saudi Arabia distributed dangerous weapons and named Jihadis, but in reality spread the virus of hateful literature and culture due to which slaughter houses were opened in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, the announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan, and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly and tried its best to convince India that she should attack Pakistan.
This shattered the confidence of Americans in the area.
However, India did not make such threats, nor had they any plans to.
The rest was taken care of by either attacks from the Taliban or American military posts.
Thus it was proven that without the support of Pakistan and its army, America can do nothing.
Karachi is Pakistan's business and economic center and Dubai of the less privileged areas.
Hundreds of thousands do not return empty handed from here. But since the law was enforced on the western borders, Karachi has taken all the attention.
Now they are looking to occupy this city.
For the first time Pathans are called Pashtoons. They are made to fight by making them strangers to each other. What they need is to be united.
One possible solution to the problem is this that either Urdu speakers learn Pashto or Pashto speakers learn Urdu.  What is better is that they all learn English.
You will surely think this a ridiculous suggestion. Do you think that reason of this conflict is not ridiculous?
The reason of violence is language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, I gave this suggestion  in childhood. In reality, to my friends in which there were people according to classification from every religion and dialect but friends used to laugh on my talks.
At that time the condition of Jinn, of hatred, of dialectal, and religious was not alive and strong but it was brewing internally.
I do not understand what and why is this happening?
Are these the very same signs of Last day?
For what crime are innocent and guiltless being killed?
The reasons are in front of everyone who wants to divide Pakistan in pieces.  Thos that are active here and who do this have religion and nor country.
Whether it is Karachi or Bombay, our homes are burnt with their own lamps (we have destroyed our homes ourselves.)
When the government comes, they just change names of the places to build a name for themselves. Just like these days airports, roads, buildings are all named Benazir.
What has happened in Karachi, is this what Benazir means?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of the RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
Unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awakened sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
Where reactions full of patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties have taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time they have also given American planners one more chance to think.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the turmoil in Karachi and management is showing self interest.
Management can control the situation in one hour but it is being given wind on purpose.
Pressure of political parties on police and rangers keep them from doing the operation.
Talk of getting united are only limited to statements, political parties should let go of their self interests and work for the interest of a common man.
As long as there is political pressure on the government, more incidents will take place. May Allah save Pakistan.
I believe these people are the biggest terrorists.
And there are definitely some foreign forces at work here, but I do not know whose.
And the sad thing is that if such a situation was prevalent in any border town, the government would take care of that place. But since this is far from the border, the government looks helpless.
The government should set up an operation here in order to save a big and important town from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth out of fear, and as for the local media, it is even more afraid.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that either the Urdu-speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun-speaking people learn Urdu; even better, both could learn English.
You might think this is a funny proposal, but isn't the reason for the clashes funny?
that the cause of extremism could be language?
They spilled blood in Karachi and the story that each citizen was fearing for a long time was finally written.
No one left any stone unturned, and the reports that surfaced in the media was 50% of what actually happened here in four days.
I stayed up the last three nights, and I am still afraid.
The people who killed the cobblers and peanut sellers who evacuated the hotel (this is a fragment)
The people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of Allah's punishment which can catch them anytime.
What do you think are the reasons for this sudden violence?
(BBC)
Keeping the heart rendering Mumbai attacks in view and driving to search for a cause for the violence in Karachi is not at all needed, rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in 'blood'.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control.
Liaquat Ali Khan and many other freedom fighters belong to that. He was writing a poem to remove Mr. Saiko's misunderstanding.
We will again establish the old traditions.
We gave lives for it and we are going to protect it by giving our lives.
Faizan Tausif Siddiqui
It's very sad that the whole country is at stake and we are still fighting each other
Mr. Siddiqui, in Wikipedia
We got to know that Liaquat Ali Khan was related to the province of Punjab, in the area of Karnal and belongs to a Punjabi family.
For his effort of refugees, today refugees consider him as there own.
For every action there is a reaction.
You can tolerate till your own bust.
I'jaz A'wan
Sir, before you get a large number of people with proposals, I shall tell you that the open signs of this mischief is also found on the walls of Karachi in the form of posters and wall chalking.
We have been bearing both types of mischief.
Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan. They did not have to face any reaction.
Contrary to that, they are pecking at the chest of Pakistan.
There used to be one Muslim League.  They made the rough version of the 18th amendment and handed it over to the People's Party.
Before that, MQM and Muslim League had already handed in rough versions of the 18th amendment to the national assembly and senate.
It still seems that the copy of the 18th amendment is a political trickery, and no one is sincere about accepting that amendment.
This is why no fuss was made in the assembly or on the floor of senate over this amendment and the parliament was not forced into accepting the amendment.
It looks as if the parties just wanted to get the thing off their backs by submitting the rough versions so that tomorrow they may say that we submitted our versions of the amendment, but the government speaker did not take action.
How is it possible that MQM coalition partner of the government, Muslim League N an underhand ally of the government and Muslim league Q the party to approve the seventeenth amendment be sincere enough to approve the disapproved amendment?
It's just like writing your name amongst Shaheeds by just putting color on yourself.
The People's Party is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment anyways.
What would one think of getting his own hands cut?
As long as Zardari is the president, the seventeenth amendment is not going to be canceled.
This is the opinion of the majority in our survey takers and so is deemed to be the truth.
If the seventeenth amendment had been canceled then Zardari would never had become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Musharaf because along with being the president he is also the chairman of the People's party.
As long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.
In order to cancel the seventeenth amendment, the political parties will first have to dismiss President Zardari from the presidency.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
Most of the elders from our family belonged to the labor community.
In our childhood, when we used to see our uncles doing labor work, we used to pray to Allah to save us from this hard work.
To avoid this, we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what we should we do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor work.
The editor wrote in reply that we should select certain subjects and become doctors or engineers.
Right from beginning, my trend was towards engineering. I had selected technical drawing instead of Biology as well.
But at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.
I studied biology for a month and then took math as an alternate subject when nothing worked out.
The fear of labor work made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than other in my family, for which I am always thankful to God.
I remembered that when my two sons and I were trying to remove the carpets from our old house.
It was only half an hour since he started working that the little boy said, "Daddy, I am not born to do this".
I said that if this is true, then study a lot like us and get rid of the physical labor.
The son said, "I am studying and I will get through it, but it is the work that I cannot do".
We did that work in three hours and came back home.
The point of this story is that if a person picks his destiny, whatever is the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving that destiny.
Here if you do not know what you have to do then may God help you!
It is said that you should not say bad things about the dead, but what shall we do? We see only bad things in Benazir, even on the anniversary of her first death.
Benazir, for her selfish purpose, crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs after giving the list of the names of those who were fighting for freedom. On the other hand, she gave India the chance to keep its full attention on Kashmir after helping to suppress the Punjab movement.
A tug-of-war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history and has pushed the country back many years.
Benazir continued to give negative comments on Kashmir and the nuclear program after being exiled.
Baenazir violated the pact with Nawaz Shareef in London by making a deal with General Musharaf
Because of Baenazir's open hand policy towards family members in earning money during her rule, he became known as Mr. Ten Percent.
During Baenazir's rule, her brother got murdered, and even today his murderers are still at large.
Though a woman herself, Baebnazir did not fight for women's rights.
The way in which Baenazir did politics on her fathers dead body, in the same way her followers are doing politics on the dead bodies of her family.
Baenazir got to be a leader twice and in that time punishing her fathers murders at one side she didn't even file charges against them.
Sadly, no leaders condemn the day that began the 37 years of separation of eastern Pakistan.
We should have mourned this 16th of September as a black day and taken steps to prevent similar tragic incidences from occurring in the future.
On this day, we should have sent the Bangali's letters of consolation and tried to reconcile with them.
Now we must examine the reasons why eastern Pakistan was separated.
He planned on bringing back the people of Bihar, who were stuck in Bangladesh, and he would send them gifts to keep their spirits up.
We have become so insensitive in our neighborhood, that if someone dies, we are not even aware of it.
We do not care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
If a huge calamity passes by, we forget about it and by the next day we carry on with our normal life.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again, like East and West Germany had done.
If we sacrifice a little for each other and leave our selfishness behind us, we can again become one.
It doesn't look as if this dream will be fulfilled in the near future.
Today, it was announced in the news, that the governor of Illinois, in The United States, was caught on corruption charges.
He would soon be brought up on charges and forced to resign his position.  My American friend, who had knowledge of the political system in The U.S. And in Pakistan seemed embarrassed by this example of democracy.
In America, no one is above the law, not even government officials.
and there is your country, Pakistan, whose president has been elected after his corruption charges were dropped.
My sense of humor spoke, and I said "What's wrong if a governor got arrested in America - in Pakistan, we arrested the Prime Minister overnight and hanged him once, and another time we exiled one."
tell me when it happened in America?
Pakistan sent off the criminal with a guard of honor from the presidency. Tell me, when did such a thing happen in America?
In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was suspended in such a way that besides the public support he is unable to be restored so far, did this ever happen in America?
A holder of a falsified degree was made the Minster of Health in Pakistan, did this ever happen in America?
after hearing all this, the American went down laughing and then conceded defeat.
in this picture, President Zardari is smiling despite being surrounded by Americans on all four sides.
it looks from his smile
He thinks that America is supporting his government, but he forgot that a year ago they supported Pervez Musharaf.
The picture looks like a picture of Family.
Before this no picture, as such, has been published in which the President is with 3 American authorities.
It looks like America's work has been increased in Pakistan and one or more Authorities are working on it or they might not believe that person as compared to the first one.
It might be possible that they have planned this also, keeping in mind the nature of President Zardari's promise fulfillment.
If he was an intelligent politician then he would not be smiling in this picture and his face would show some embarassment.
If the Principle of Democracy is applied to this picture then President Zardari is in the minority.
According to Democracy, the majority makes the rules for the nation and that is who is shown in the picture.
Heaven like Swat of Pakistan is also known as Switzerland.
till now, according to Government Policy, cross talks are also going along with the power use
but power use is resulting in increase power of Taliban and increasing sympathy for Taliban among people beside that it is not providing any benefits
The government must, instead of using the power, eliminate the causes of the issue.
by eliminating the causes, Fazlullah and Taliban will automatically disperse.
the Sharia bill proposed by ANP will, to a great extent, become the solution of the problems of Swat.
But besides implementation of the Sharia, the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues.
At the beginning of General Musharaf rise, it looked like the nation had rid itself of the incompetent politicians, but the lust for power changed all his plans.
all the hopes were from the participation in the "War of terror", he had started considering himself immortal.
those steps which were expected, all broke-off.
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, made a deal with the thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army but never know what wass happening to the present government.
Either its Bajor or Swat, the army does not control terror but bombs the ""Enemy"" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy a mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy.
Despite the military operation in Swat, a war-torn area of NWFP, things are getting worse.
On one hand the writ of GOVT is limited to a resolution of condemnation passed by National assembly while on other hand the influence of Taliban's FM channel is increasing in swat.
The common citizen has no choice but to obey the rule of power.
In swat security forces have used lethal weapons and have claimed to kill many extremists. But despite these causalities, Taliban's Power is rising. They are controlling nearly 80% area of Swat.
Result: GOVT is not accepting its failure and Talibans are getting stronger
The poor citizen is the only looser.
""how are the Talibans"" asked by someone in Swat. It is answered as ""They are very good; they are fighting the war against the enemies of God""
Then asked about the army. Answer was ""very good, it is fighting against the enemies of our country""
Who are the enemies of religion and country? ""The poor citizens"", it was answered.
I am greatly astonished, how the Army of Pakistan will fight against Indian Army. It has failed to  control a small group of Talibans.
They are unable to track the illegal FM radio channel of Taliban. I think that can easily be tracked.
This FM radio is strongly propagating the agenda of hatred and terror.
After the girls' school, now they are demolishing the schools for boys.
curfew is imposed to facilitate the taliban's movement
Tonight during curfew, they have made new bunkers in the nearby areas of Mangora.
Question arises, how did they reach there during curfew?
If Army can kill Akbar bugti in a cave, why taliban can't be targeted?
For God's sake, Army should take actions to free the helpless people of Swat from the brutal occupation of Taliban. This will improve the image of Pakistan Army.
He has said that religion is the reason of bloodshed; kindly tell me if it would be a peaceful world without any concept of religion?
Does religion divide us on ethnic , linguistic and regional basis?
No Sir, religion is what teaches that no one is black or white, punjabi or muhajir otherwise if religion was not present, then half world would have vanished in the war between white and black and other half fighting over the status and sect.
Actually, religion gives moral teachings to man. And binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here. And he should spend his life according to his teachings.
As a muslim, I have total faith that Islam is complete way of life and a true religion.
After living in London, for many years I used to ask wellness of my family over the phone every morning. Although most of them did not even call once to find out how we were. Then I realized that they do not even like our phone calls so we stopped calling.
Living here in France for the past two years, I have also felt the same thing.
Do not know why people expect us to call.
A resolution passed about Iraq few hours back, Darfar has absolutely no problem in sending the peace army.
Bombay attacks were condemned, in no time banning dubious groups is only a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are consenting.
Oh caretakers of international peace, life is finishing here!
Is the wait really going on for it to finish?
So that some oppressed person would not even be able to think about using some weapon of mass destruction, like ill will, to obtain their right?
When a father is running around holding the corpse of his son, even then a small wave of sorrow does not arise from any part of your heart.
If not, you have no right to be called a human.
Rather you are a black spot on the name of humanity.
OK, this was proved that this area was also the home of the Israelis for thousands of years.
Ideally, these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection, but since their strings are in the hands of the western and Arab countries, peace is not possible without their will.
Rather, now even Iran wants to fight a proxy war from here.
Even if Israeli action has stopped for a while, it will start again after some incident.
The interest of the owner of BBC is associated with serving America and Israel, and this is why in the name of 'enlightenment' it has come out with a series of Zionist favoring blogs, and is doing biased and blind propaganda.
What the BBC doing is just a formality. Their primary objective is to generate sympathy.
I would like to request of the moderator that the commentary of the applicant be published to show that the BBC still have some respect for facts.
Thanks.
I don't know how this story began, but one is sure that the Dracula of every age is thirsty for human blood.
There were wars and bloodshed in every era of history.
It is strange that people of the 21st century, who claim to be more civilized, do not show any concern over open bloodshed.
How does he not feel that what is happening in the world around him is the distorted/evil aspect of humanity.
The most tragic fact: how the current aspect of civilized man will present the concept of humanity for generations to come.
well wisher, Sajjad ul Hasan, Hayderabad dakan.
At the moment, in Dera Ghazikhan and in other parts of the country, it is raining.
Here is a poem according to the weather. Enjoy the weather along with this poem.
These rains are with your presence.
If it rains, it's spring.
If it stays, then it's peace.
Sometimes it comes without a reason.
At times it spreads over day and night.
Sometimes very noisy and sometimes very quiet.
These rains are with your presence.
In a memory, at night.
To buried ash.
Sometimes it was such, that the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burnt itself.
Sometimes each drop seemed sorrowful.
Even the rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What is it to them, whether the country lasts or not?
Whether the public sells or takes lemon peels, and scrubs the temple bells with them.
For one, our media is also corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government, and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday afternoon, something surprising happened.
All the police are running around, but they do not check illegal parking.
Also, New York City traffic police did not bother with illegally parked vehicles.
A U.S. Air Force plane was forced to land in the Hudson River.
Till today only this much is known: The ""terrorist" was actually a flock of geese.
It was historical cold spell yesterday in New York.
Normally, the temperature never drops this low.
The pain started in my own jaw after walking outside for 30 minutes.
Imagine the horrendous condition of those people who jumped from the plane into the icy river.
The reason for their happiness is that all of them were safe.
The reason for concern is that the company was in financial crisis when the plane went down in the water.
Seeing all those sites, I reached the New Jersey side from the  West Side Highway. There I found the South Bond closed. What should I do?
Coming back I got wedged on the busy street.
Thank the Lord! After an hour of hurry, a way was opened to me. I found myself at the 56th Street exit.
I had not come across the exit first, nor the long lines.
Mekki: My Pakistan..! Good greetings. Eid Mubarak to you.
Umar: Of course, Faithful.!
Shugfath: Good greetings..! Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I have had two chickens. It's a sacrifice. Janzeb will tell you how it was.
There was no other option. Otherwise, I would have to go to the farm
and prepare the meat, skin it  too.
Basim.Net might take some to repair.
What happened on the forum?
Linko
In order to work with Listen to Blog, see it in Fire Fox.
Duffer: Same to you. Eid greetings to you.
Sir please use Fire Fox.
The snow will vanish.
We unnecessarily kept thinking of these Taliban of Swat as indelicate, but who were only unhappy over women's education.
They kept expressing their grief by demolishing a womens schools and college somewhere every day.
But just like other ideas, this idea did not also come true. According to this report by CNN, today on the sacred day of Monday, this Taliban gang of Swat have blasted a boy's school.
In Swat,the Taliban closed down the school.
The schools of girls were closed down first, as in the case of the famous English school Ladies First and I do not see why the people did not consider the Taliban free of crimes.
It is also known that it is wrong that the Taliban are only against the education of girls.
not this but it is wonderful that they are against total education.
These freedom fighters are gifted with more power and the Devil
which is commanding us and has helped to abolish it.
Amin; after it Amin.
Wonderful, 120 school have been closed so far.
The tradition of an engagement before birth with Muslims, to marriage with the Quran in order to control inheritance and the insistence of many mufties that the girl became an adult and sensible at 8 years and not a minor, was not only there but in India a girl was married with a frog.
See the pictures pictured at the time of marriage.
Sometime before this a girl was married to a dog.
Now that is a groom that we have to see!
A decline in traditional morales has become increasingly evident during the 21'st century.
An age of computer technology.  Where computers continue to become greater parts of everyday life.
There are reservations among some.  People who feel our growing dependence upon computers for computer technology.  Especially in the areas of finiance and monatory areas.  Is a hazardous precident.
Credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of ecommerce have gone a long way towards streamlinging modern life.  However this convience does have a price tag all it's own.  Their use trades away the anomiyity of old fashioned paper currency.  Giving modern law agencies unprecendented and easy access to civilian finiancial records.
The simple act of using a credit card.  Leaves a paper trail that any agency or curious individual can easily follow.  Detailing your daily life.
As use of hard currency continues to diminsh.  More and more people will naturally shift towards the use of credit cards and other ecommerce devices.  Even those who previously chose not to.
This trend has also encouraged crime to shift in similar directions.  Criminals would now rather steal your card, with all the power and personal information attached.  Then rob a banks vault.
Similarly computer has provided means for  friendship or networking.    Computers have also provided a new method for fostering friendship as well as building social networks.  Unlike anything that has come before.
Social Networking sites like Orkut, Facebook and MySspace comes are first tier compared according to popularity.
However, don't you feel psychologically that the more we are accustoming ourselves to social networks, the more we are physically getting away from people.
For example, match making websites that match your choices to other peoples' choices to find similarities and you get a list of matches.
Now can you spend your life with a person exactly like you ?
I can't and that's why we can't compromise a life partner who is half or partly similar to you.
Whatever I lack can be compensated by the partner.
I guess I got a lesser part of intelligence.
Since childhood, whenever an elder said anything to me, that was the truth according to me.
This is why I believe dad has the answer to every question in the world.
People used to make a lot of jokes about me on this.
the only thing that look truth is which can be done in real.
It's frustrating,that they feel it is necessary to lie.
Because of this, he also suffered at this age.
it is always my wish to tell the truth to the best of my knowledge.
Don't tell lies, especially in the name of God.
and say Inshallah only when the prayers is only for the God that he will accomplish it
God Knows all about your will.
This is the only complication due to the distance from the religion.
According to our religion and the law of Pakistan, a minor should stay with their mother.
Their expenses are the responsibility the father when the father can meet them.
Then when the kids mature, they can live with anyone they want.
You have spoken truly about the misunderstandings relatives sometimes create.
Our behavior is controlled by feudal thinking
Ever here this way of thinking is working that new co-sharers will be born in father's property and this is where the opposition is shown. Otherwise their father's this behavior is worth praise and pursuance.
With reference to relationships, these forced affiliations have created evil in our society.
Marriage to a divorced person or a widow is becoming less acceptable.
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason for many family breakups.
In our society, if wife of a 50-55 year old man or husband of a woman goes to the next world and he marries again, why is he not respected?
We have a Pakistani uncle living close to us. His wife passed away around 10-12 years ago. Now after all his children got married, he married a widow. All his kids have turned against him because of it.
In my point of view, it is their religious right, what do you say?
""To take place of our mother in the being of our mother"" what kind of thinking?
According to my thinking, his sons should think about what he done wrong when he married the widow after the marriage of children?
The widow got a helper and he got a person to manage his home.
His sons and daughters engaged in each of their lives and would not care for him.
The reason is lack of knowledge.
If their wifes denied to serve him tomorrow, then what will he do?
It is the result of the stress of society.
When the people laughed at the family's actions, the sons denied the second marriage.
We should justify such situation as their father's doing was according to Islam.
It is a curse in our society that we are caught in from 40 to 50 years.
The feeling of a wife is that her husband can do lots of bad things whatever it may be, but he doesnot has the marry again
If she has the potency, she will try, even after her death.
Along with her husband, she also losing the life after death, and she is one for the evils things in the environment
Saying Islam, Islam from the mouth does not do any thing, we like the thing which are there in rituals
like, demotivation for the girls education, and love marriage, etc.,
now your Question is, if the big brother rather bringing the widow to his home, he might have went to her home itself, then there will no querrals from his children, (they quarrel may be in the widows children)
We embraced Islam even before the separation of Hindustan and Pakistan, but we have not came out of such evil thinking and this ritual are a more important than islam
The second marriage of a man is bad, divorce is known to be bad. The divorced woman is untouchablesion, the marriage of a man with a elder woman is said to be the evil plan of the woman. the above things are of such evil thinkings
and we think that if we wont follow modernism, we considered to a old thinking man
Embracing Islam is easy, but to come out from such evil thinking is somewhat impossible.
Allah bless us with the ability and courage to do this task.  Allah blessed us with the ability and courage to do this task.
Ameen.   Amen.
It was never that difficult to write Urdu.  It has never been difficult to write Urdu.
It took century's to write this little.  It has taken a century to write this ...

Ameer Taimur in his book, I am a Taimur, wrote : "I found the secret in in my lifetime that if the commander of any army is present on the front line then that army will never be defeated."
But here the things are altogether different.    Things here are different.
They say the population is by default for getting killed for us.
If anyone dies from the population, it is considered Murder.
May the peace and blessings of the Almighty be upon you.
As I was coming back to my shop after the Isha prayer tonight, a man sitting in his car called and waved to me.
I thought that this man had probably lost his way or had a question, so I stopped.
He asked me if I spoke Arabic, and I said, "Yes.  How can I help you?"
He told me that he had come from Riyadh to Medina and someone had picked his pocket.  He asked if I could help, but I said no and gave him 12 riyals to help him reach Riyadh.  After traveling a little further, he began doing the same.
Angrily, I cursed at him and threatened to call the police, so he ran away.
this is the situation of Muslims now that even for begging we ride our cars along with our families and make at least 2 to 3 thousand a day.
However there is a clear Hadith (SAAW) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one.
May Allah bless us and make us true Muslims (Amen)

The wife of famous singer Adnan Sami approached a Police Station in Mumbai; accusing him of torture.
The Police Station advised her to approach the court.
Saba Galadari, the wife of Adnan Sami, gave an application against her husband that Adnan Sami continuously tortures her.
He is also administering in human behavior against her.
Now this thing has gone out of her tolerance, therefore, a case may be registered against Adnan Sami.
The police  station has advised her to approach the court instead of registering  the case, on the plea that the case is not within the valid jurisdiction of the police station.
Do you think that the accusation on Adnan Sami by his wife is correct?
Can this accusation be an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Inform us about your opinion on the Subject.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
as far as allegations are concerned, anyone can post it on someone else.  As far as allegations are concerned, anyone can make accusations about someone else.
nothing comes before prestige.  Nothing comes before prestige,
however may be the relations between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he left his respectful life and went to India to make money and now this fame has caught him badly.  however, Adnan Sami's actions of leaving a respectful life to live in India with his present wife reflect badly on him.
this is a consequence of his own deeds.  This is a result of his own actions.

SriLanka beat Pakistan in the three day international cricket match series for 2-1.
In the first one day match Pakistan defeated SriLanka, however SriLanka won the remaining two matches.
In the third day match the performance of the national team was too awesome. The team chasing a target of 309 runs of SriLanka was able score only 75 in 23 overs.The national team should thus have learned a lesson from this defeat.
From the results of the series, it becomes evident that the performance of the national cricket team is not consistent.
Despite home field advantage and all claims, the national team suffered defeat. What do you think are the reasons?

Malik Babar Husain, Jeddah. It is very sad that even in today's modern age, such ignorant traditions are prevalent. If the landlord or the property owner targets innocent people with his harsh dictatorship, who will call them Muslims?
Let any big shot walk on these burning coals. Why does the government allow them to do that?
When will legal justice come into play?
The Sri Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan, to play the one day international series.
The foreign team is still coming to Pakistan despite tensions with India.

It is all these people's doing that Kashmiris have been fighting a war of independence for the past sixty years.
No, no one  asked, now that they are caught in a war of extremism and terrorism so they have started talking about peace and settlement.
First they generally massacred Muslims, and now they are perplexedly settling the matters.
At any rate, Pakistan has to understand their duplicitous policies.
Asad Khan London
India creates such situations that world concentration on Kashmir has turned back.
But Pakistan has always shown India  its real face to the world.
Now the British government also understands that India made a bad image of Pakistan in the name of terrorism to turn back eyes on Kashmir occupation.
and are frustrated to talk this matter over with Pakistan.
British Foreign minister David Milliband said that by resolving Kashmir issue terrorism will be reduced and the government of Pakistan can handle new challenges impressively on its border.
Its clear that before that newly elected American president Barack Obama will alsogive his thoughts in a similarmanner.
British foreign minster said while talking with media and w roteon one essay that though of fight against terrorism is wrong for challenge of danger for its own safety killed people is the policy of Bush.
David Milliband said that Pakistan did not show a soft consideration for terrorist groups.
Due to pressure from big powers to resolve conflict of Kashmir, is India trying to create intense environment in this region to turn back concentration from this problem?
Is Mumbai terrorism is a part of this conspiracy?
Does India want to use terrorism as a means to avoid dialogue?

Usman Aftab
I think it is the big countries, That want to harm Pakistan.
In fact They are thinking of means to control Pakistan; They know Pakistan is an atomic power.
They want to create an environment for revolution.
Foreign countries are thinking that if Pakistan is cornered, It will pose more political and geographical problems. They want to help Pakistan and want to achieve their vested interests.
A citizen of the USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition; walking stick in arm and name of Ram on lips.
I think from sometimes, there is an anxiety and to relieve that, Pakistan is blamed or associated with some negative event.
We are ready in all ways.  The Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else.  We know how to give mouth breaking answers.
Faheem Siddiqi
Ras al Khaima.  This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but now India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality as to who is in how deep waters.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani, said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy.  This is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers movement not played any role?
What do you want say about about the words of the Prime Minister?

The President of America, George W. Bush, said to Barack Obama that he in his position made many mistakes and that if Obama wants to correct them, he can.
As a president, and based on the situation and rules and regulations of America, I have taken steps to work only for the benefit of America.
He said that the enemies of America are planning today to attack America. To stop this this is the biggest challenge for Barack Obama.
He said that being unable to find the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a problem, and he felt that saying he won the battle in Iraq was his biggest mistake.
In the last conference given at the White House, he said, "This is my last press conference, and I thank all those who have attended."
Do you think Obama will repeat the same mistakes that Bush made?
Was Bush too late in accepting the mistakes he made?
Will Obama work to change the people's opinion of Bush?
Inform me of your opinion.

Saeed, New York
I think that most of our people are ignorant. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties. The electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has taken a serious position.
On the other side, there was an increase of an average of 18% in gas rates, while the unavailability of petrol in some cities has become a cause of great difficulty for the public.
Among the manufacturing and business circles, there are strong protests and severe protests against the long power cut and gas crisis.
Industrialist have given an ultimatum before closing the factories.
There is growing anxiety among those dwelling in  Karachi because of the eight to ten hours of electricity load shedding.
Industrial activities have almost paralyzed.
Government departments are playing a blame game on each other.
Isn't under these circumstance the proposals for increasing electricity and gas tariff a joke with the people?
Why is attention not being given in resolving the issues?
Can the government see the failing of the country's economy?
To counter these problems for the short term, what suggestions do you have?
Please inform us about your opinion.
Imran Khokar from Madina Munawara Saudi Arabia, I want to say the way the people are, they get similar leaders.
I'm surprised that the government carrying slogan of public service, is hurting them alone.
The scarcity of electricity, gas, and petroleum has become a threat.
The government has no control over the institutions.
The law and order situation is deteriorating every day, may Allah have mercy on this country.
The new year has began.
Last year was the year of outbreaks and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered in reference to terrorism.

With the new year arriving, how do you foresee it?
In your opinion, what will be the result of the political or geographical situation. What will be Obama's strategy?
Is there hope for a development towards eliminating terrorism?
When will the judicial crisis of Pakistan be finished?
What shape will the Pakistan and India relationship become?

after ruling America for 8 years, president Bush has departed from the White House and shifted to the president camp office in Camp David so that the White House can be renovated according to the new president Barrack Obama's likings.
During Bush's eight years rule, the historical attacks and destruction of the World Trade Center, attack on Pentagon and then in the name of war against terror, attacking Afghanistan and Iraq and involving forces from other countries into the war and use of American resources in it have become memorable examples of his time.
Due to this war, America itself faced the worst ever economical and financial crisis in history.

The Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one-day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, in an interview with Jeev News said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour, but due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step? Should sports be separated from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that security conditions in India are bad, England's cricket team is continuing its tour. Therefore, why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this?
Salman, Karachi
Those people who are proud about going to India
and who make their films and videos over there, should now have their eyes opened as to how much the people of India respect them.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami should return to Pakistan the first chance he gets because he was not respected elsewhere.
Fareed Ahmed
Karachi
India's attitude has changed after the Bombay Attacks.
Jagjit Singh has showed his reaction in the way that he hates Pakistan and Pakistanis.
One should know that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsley. How is he a bad singer now? Adnan Sami Should stay in India, there is no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshaad Alam
Karachi, at the advice of Jagjit Singh, said that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances? Pakistanis! Open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Bombay incident, their hateful statements have increased. The same people are now saying evil things against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to foreign news agencies, in the farewell trip of American President George Bush, during a press conference with the Prime Minister Nur-al-Maliki in his office, the situation became hilarious when an Iraqi journalist called Bush and said "Dog, this is a farewell kiss".
After this, the journalist took his shoe off and threw it at Bush. President Bush ducked with expertise and saved himself from getting hit by the shoe.
The second shoe hit the American flag.
Security agents pulled this journalist away from the president.
On this occasion, President Bush said that he did not know why he did that. The shoe was a size ten. The president was not very upset by the incident.
In your opinion, does this action of the journalist show the anger of the Iraqi public against President Bush?
What do you think about this incident?
After the Mumbai terror incidents, the tension in Indo-Pak relations escalated to an even more grave extent when Indian Air Force war planes violated Pakistani air space in the Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
Due to the reaction of the Pakistani Air Force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
According to sources, both Indian planes were full of weapons and ammunition.
This is the first of its kind incident in the current tensed situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that it is ready to defend the country.
Information Minister Sherry Rahman says that Indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed, although this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
In your opinion, does India really have an intention of an air strike on Pakistan?
Is this statement of India correct that this violation was a mistake or this was to find out the ability of the Pakistan Air Force?
Is this incident not going to aggravate the current estrangement among the two countries?

Respected martyr Benazir Bhutto was given the International Award for Human Rights after her death, which was received by her son and chairperson of the People's Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
During a session of the General Assembly in the United Nations headquarters, the former prime minister of Pakistan, martyr Benazir Bhutto, was presented with this award for acknowledgment of her efforts for human rights in a ceremony.
The 60th anniversary of the passing of the human rights resolution by the United Nations was celebrated on the 10th of December.
Among those people and institutes being recognized for their human rights work, apart from Benazir Bhutto, were former American Attorney General, Louis Ramsey Clark and Human Rights Watch, an organisation that works around the world for human rights.
On this occasion, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Abdullah Husain Harun, and other senior embassy agents were present.
What do you say about the former martyr Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto receiving this award?
Samir
Chicago
It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But, later she changed totally.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party and made her son the representative of Peoples Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi, This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
But until the iron ax is not fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are just like this, that they are adopting secretive ways. This is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations have included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed as well as two other Pakistani citizens and the name of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organisations into the list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaidah and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, practically non-existent organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba Operation Chief, Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organisations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organisations, they will be restricted from traveling and will be under arrest.
They will have to face cases.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India accusing these organizations of being responsible for the Mumbai Attacks without any proof?
Doesn't India have any local terrorist groups?
Aren't the world organizations aware of the persecution of minorities in India?
