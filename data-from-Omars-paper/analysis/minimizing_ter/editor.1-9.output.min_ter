Avoiding Dieting to Prevent the Flu.
This research of American scientists was published after many experiments on mice.
Experiments proved that mice on a lower calorie diet had comparatively less ability to fight the flu virus.
Research has proven the old myth  of fasting during fever wrong.
According to the scientists, one should eat a lot when one has a fever.
The researchers from the Michigan State University say that the rats on a diet had less power to resist the infection and their chances of dying had increased, whereas rats on a normal diet had better resistance against the flu virus.
According to Professor Elizabeth Gardner, people who diet will not only be affected by the virus flu sooner but, will also have a longer recovery time.

First Nuclear Test Done in 1990.
Thomas Reid, who has worked in the Lever National Laboratory in America as a weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the former director of technical intelligence at Los Alamos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.
This book was titled "Nuclear Express: Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation," and both writers have claimed that whichever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or had the support of another nuclear power.
in an interview with US news, Thomas Reed said that in 1990, during the rule of Benazir Bhutto, China texted Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Thomas Reid said that, for many reasons, he believes that China had tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
The reasons include the design of the bomb and some information gained during talks with the Chinese scientists.
He further added that this was the reason that in 1998 in a span of only two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments in response to Indian nuclear experiments.
Thomas Reid reminds us that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiments.
He further said that atomic bomb test Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998 was made with extreme care, and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.
When Thomas Reid was asked whether China had provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.
He said that there was proof that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and that the documents received from Libya will verify this fact.
Upon further questioning as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.
He said that he also assumed that Israel was given access to the results of this test.
Thomas Reid was also asked about China's nuclear distribution program which is ongoing.
In answer, Thomas Reid said that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Esfahan, Iran since 1991.
Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.
He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen through North Korea.

Protest against the siding of Journalists.
On Tuesday, the organization of journalists, RIUJ, held protests in front of the Islamabad Press Club of Journalists and Newspaper Workers against media owners and the government about the news channel and newspapers removing many of their employees.
Speaking to the protesters, a senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, the Federal Union of Journalists,  C.R. Shamsi said, "The politicians who protested with us yesterday on the streets, today, have become rulers and are sitting in Parliament. Out of fear of a certain lobby of media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of journalists."
He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.
An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.
He said that there should be firm measures taken against the TV and newspaper owners, and the journalists should establish a protest camp in front of Parliament to fight for their rights.

Although, according to them, there has also been an increase in the police staff.
The Security Council has passed a ban on Jamaa'athud Da'wah, after which the Pakistani government has started taking action against Jamaa'athud Da'wah across the country, and has put the chief of the Jamaa'ath, Hafiz Saeed, along with other leaders under house arrest. The appointment of the administrator in the Taibah center by the Punjab government was also a part of the action being taken against Jamaa'athud Da'wah by the joint government.
Khaqan Babar belongs to the DMG or District Management Group.
Hafiz Khalid Waheed has told that on Sunday the Commissioner of Lahore Khusro Pervez Khan, along with police and civil administration, came to the Taiba Center and inspected its different parts.

No member of the Republican party voted in favor of President Obama's plan.
The Republican party said that this economic plan was very expensive and that it would not be successful.
In The House of Representatives, 240 votes were cast in favor of the plan, while 188 votes were cast against it.
This economic reform plan has to be presented in the Senate next week, where the ruling Democratic party has a significant majority.
It is feared that due to opposition from the Republican party, its passing in the senate may not be easy.
After the passing of the economic reform plan the house, Barack Obama said to the members that they should not let political differences get in the way of this important plan.
The President said that plan, which he hoped would become law by next month, would prove helpful in creating a suitable environment in the country for business would prosper.

Bitterness between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Rajab Tayyab Erdogan almost shouted at Israeli President and said that the blood of many people has been shed in Gaza. He felt sorrow watching that people can actually applaud this military action from Israel.
Mr. Erdogan said "I think you are using such words to erase your guilt and that in a high voice. But you killed people and I am remembering those children who were killed near the shore."
Simon said that Gaza's calamity is not Israel, but Hamas, who have established a dangerous dictatorship over there.
A correspondent of BBC from Davis says that nothing like this has been seen before in an international economic forum.
However, Erdogan later stated that he respected the Israeli president and his age, which is why he did not scream at him, but whatever he was saying was very far from the truth.
Turkey is one of the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, but for the last few years there has been tension between them.
The attacks were not planned in Pakistan.
Speaking to Indian news channel NDTV, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said that the report of the Pakistani investigations into the Mumbai blast will be prepared soon.
In the attack on Mumbai last November, more than 120 people were killed.
India claims that extremist group Lashkar-e-Taiba is responsible for the attacks.
India also said that Pakistani 'state factors' were guilty in the Mumbai attacks.
After the Mumbai attacks, the relations between the two countries were affected.
When talking about the Pakistan investigation report on the incident, High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hassan has given out a hint about the whereabouts of the report.
Wajid Shams-ul-Hasan said that the investigative report denied that Pakistani soil has been used.
It must be some other place, not England.
These are the two places (Pakistan and Britain) about which I was worried.
India and the global brotherhood has put considerable pressure on Pakistan to take action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan says that it has arrested dozens of people during the action against groups which were clearly involved in the Mumbai attacks.
Wajid Shamsul Haq said: "We are not trying to cover it up."
We believe in taking action based on facts.
Our investigations will be accepted by the world.
We will try to satisfy India with the results (of the investigation).
while defending the delay in the investigation in Pakistan he said that it takes time to collect, understand and check these kind of information.
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that India took 45 days to hand over its dossier.
Republican Leader Also Elected Red Indian
In the sixth round of elections of the Republican party, Michael Steele,who got 91 votes out of 168, won.
In the selection for the post of Chairman, the candidate opposing Steele, Katon Dawson, got 77 votes, whereas the ex-Chairman Duncan withdrew from the competition in the second stage.

After his win, Michael Steel said in his speech "We are saying to our friends and enemies together, come with us, but those who will cause problems in this, be prepared to separate from us." Michael Steel is from Maryland, where he has also been the deputy governor.
He became famous in 2006 when he ran for a seat in the senate.

Now, after being selected the chairman of the party, the country-wide projects of the party will be under his supervision.
He fought elections promising that he will give the party a new cause and use new approaches to add conservative supporters to the party.
Indian Claim Presence of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaysh-e-Mohammad in Jammu
There are reports of the presence of militants in the Ponch province of Jammu.
According to official sources, on receiving secret information, police and army have surrounded the area and begun a search.
At this time a fight started in which four militants, two soldiers and one policeman were killed.
According to the sources, fights were going on until the last news broke.  In this area, where militants associated with Lashker-e-Tayyaba and Josh-e-Muhammad are present, more soldiers have been sent to fight them.
Meanwhile, the Chief Minister selected by the joint government, Umar Abdullah, met with the governor and informed him about his being selected the leader of his party, the National Conference in the assembly.
Congress, the ally of the National Conference, also informed the governor of their advocacy of Omar Abdullah.
Umar Abdullah will be administered the oath as the Chief Minister of the State tomorrow.
Remember, the National Conference became the biggest party in the current state elections by gaining 28 seats in the assembly of 87 members. Keep in mind that Separatist Parties boycotted the elections.
Congress, which secured 17 seats, accepted to form a coalition government with the National Conference.
Party workers welcomed Omar Abdullah with great fanfare on his arrival in Srinagar today.
On this occasion, Omar Abdullah says that he will play his role in making the talks possible between the Indian government and separatists. However, this will not be possible until the elections in India and formation of the new government.
The European Union's role in Peace in the Middle East
From the official point of view, the role of the European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
According to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
The spokesperson of the European Commission, Amadeu Altafaj, said that every effort which helps advancing the joint message of the European Union to the two parties is welcome.
As far as the state policy is concerned, everyone seems alright.
But in reality the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
As the President of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is weak.
On top of that, internal fighting has made it all the more helpless.
On the other hand, the French President, Sarkozy, is behaving as if he is still the President of the European Union.
France has completed its 6 month presidency period.
Sarkozy wants to play a presidential role, and he is able to, but he does not have the permission to do so.
The most funny situation is faced by the French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner.
He is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of the Czech Republic, Schwarzenberg.
What's worse, both the foreign ministers are giving different statements about the war in the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself, whereas according to Kouchner this war does not come under defense policy. On the other side, Germany has also sent its special ambassador to the Middle East. The European Union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues.
Its evidence is the reaction of Israel, which does not give any importance to the conciliation efforts of the EU.
This is a golden chance for the European Union to do something since America, due to the policies of George W. Bush, has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial Crisis: Suicide of Billionaire German Industrialist.
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany, left a huge business group behind him.
But earlier common German citizens did not know much about him.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 million to one billion euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle was under intense pressure.
Some time back, the bank agreed to provide Merkel Group an emergency loan. But, Adolf Merkel,who raised a small industrialist group to the position of a strong industrial group whose annual income was approximately 30 billion Euro, could not bare the loss in his investment capability.
After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quickly, putting it on a new track.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm,the  Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel Group around the world is near 100,000, and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical company Ratiopharm, always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the management of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks sanctioned 400 million euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it can improve its financial conditions in the long term.
Likewise after the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain as it was.
Crime rate among the immigrants in Germany
According to the fresh statistics, crime rate among the immigrants from 2004 to 2007 is
dropped from 22.9%
to 21.4%
According to Joachim Herrmann, the Bavarian Interior Minister, this would appear to be a positive change.
He said: "It is important to note that the number of foreigners getting German citizenship is increasing."
Therefore this should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German, his background is foreign.
Herrmann said that his province will take this into account when gathering statistics in 2010.
Besides Bavaria, Hamburg is also thinking  along the same lines.
A senator for foreign affairs from CDU, Christoph Ahlhaus, has said: "When research is done in a scientific manner, man can not pre-decide its results but it is based on the facts and figures that come out as a result of the research."
Ahlhaus diverted the attention to a research report from the anti crime's provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamberg, it was investigated that out of all crimes happening there what percentage have the involvement of foreigners.
results showed that the foreigners here have
had a lower crime percentage than the crimes taking place in the whole state.
Contrary to this, during 2006, when the percentage of youngsters committing crimes was calculated, it became evident that the youngsters from a foreign background committing crime was 44
.7 percent.
However, other political parties of Germany for example, SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei,were against this proposal that while collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired which German citizens have foreign backgrounds.

Among the martyred are 275 innocent children, who have slept in the lap of death, smiling at the deception of the leaders of Arab countries and of so-called human rights organizations.
Today, freedom fighters forced the Israeli forces back from the area of Ajeen and showed glorious righteousness. They had the power of the faith and shahadat.
If it were not for the deception of Egyptian president, Hasani (not) Mubarak, the brave and loyal Hamas Mujahids would have defeated Israel a long while ago, but apart from the Israeli siege, the Egyptians have also placed Palestinian Muslims under siege, which is the saddest story of Arab history.
Here, the Saudi Arabian and Jordanian governments are giving the Israeli government political and economic support, and are helping Israel by deceiving the helpless Muslims of Gaza.

President Ahmadinejad said, expressing surprise over the Arab countries and their leaders' silence over the beastly acts of Israel, that Israel is subjecting the Palestinian public to a holocaust.

President George Bush: Terrorism Still a Threat for America

The American President ignored the hurt and suffering of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, and defended his policies saying that America is still the biggest supporter country of independence. However, commentators do not accept the reality of the unpopular president's remarks, as America is neither a supporter of freedom, nor a supporter of human rights, but rather it is the most mischievous country in the world, which not only supports a bloodthirsty country like Israel, but is also directly involved in its crimes.
Israel is committing massacre by slaughtering children, women and common people and America's President is praising him. This is the humanity and freedom the America that the world is witnessing in Gaza and other parts of the world.
Usama Hamdan: Presence of army in Palestine continues
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, Usamah Hamdan,  the Hamas leader in Lebanon, told French News Agency during an interview that a one-sided ceasefire from the Israeli side is against the comprehensive international efforts for a ceasefire. He said that as long as Israel is present in Gaza, a one-sided ceasefire is meaningless.
He said that the one-sided ceasefire was an unsuccessful effort of Israel to escape defeat. Hamdan said that if Israel wants long-term peace, it will have to accept Hamas's conditions as well as end this siege.
The Hamas leader in Lebanon made it clear that if Israel tries a one-sided ceasefire with its army remaining in the Gaza belt, there will be resistance against it.
In Beirut, attending a conference in solidarity with the Gaza people Asama Hamadan asked the European countries to discontinue diplomatic relations with Israel.
The Hamas leader said that the increasing numbers of the martyred and injured will only increase our determination.
He told the Palestinian public to stay firmly rooted and resist the enemy like a boulder.
Pakistan: Taliban kill 6 people in Pakistani tribal region of North Waziristan.

Whereas two more dead bodies were found from the main area of Miranshah, they were thrown in the market of a Bazaar .
Letters written in Urdu were also found close the corpses, claiming that the dead were killed for spying.

President Barack Obama expected to sign order closing    notorious Guantanamo Bay prison.
Mehr News Agency report sources say that the American President will sign the order to close down the notorious Guatanamo Bay prison.
The new American president, Barack Obama, started working on his campaign promises at the surface level.
In this regard, President Obama called for making a plan for recalling the army from Iraq, while the American president will sign an order today to close the notorious Guantanamo Bay prison.
It is expected that President Barack Obama will probably sign the order today by which the Guantanamo prison will be closed within one year.
It is expected that White House will review the investigative methods from suspected terrorists. Misbehavior with prisoners can also be banned.
President Barack Obama started to fulfill his election campaign promises from his first day in office, and first of all started by taking steps toward making the actions and workings of the government transparent.
Experts say that the American president has begun efforts to save the falling image of America throughout the world. That will be difficult, because as long as it keeps supporting the bloodthirsty Israeli government, it can not be expected to do anything good.

Blair criticized the Bush administration for speaking only to Mahmood Abbas and ignoring Hamas. It should be clear that the western countries have realized the democratic and organizational powers of Hamas and are calling for bringing them into the talks, whereas previously they used to consider it a terrorist organization. A terrorist organization which is trying to defend its country and struggling to save its own house from the clutches of others. Whose house and country have been in the hand of the occupying Israeli government for 60 years.

Despite the military activity going on in Swat during the last one and a half years, about 150 educational institutions were destroyed by the militants by the use of explosives and arson.
Due to the destruction of these educational institutions; thousands of girls and boys were deprived of the facility of education.

Tea: an Effective Cure for Breast Cancer
According to a new research, three cups of tea a day
can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age, by more than a third.
Research at the Moffitt Cancer Center in the American State of Florida, has showed that chances of getting chest cancer in those women under 50 years of age
who drink at least three cups of tea a day is reduced by up to 37%.
The research study also claims that it does not help older women even if they drink three or more cups of tea daily.
Specialists think that this is because of the presence of such components in tea that are more effective against the types of cancer tumors which usually target women under 50 years of age.
In Moffitt Cancer Center, in the city of Tampa, Florida state, a research was conducted on over 5000 women, who had undergone treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles with women who were safe from breast cancer.
The experts also found out that on a particular type of cancer, Lobular, tea had shown a great effect and it reduced by 66 percent.
Almost every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type of it.
This type of cancer is more dangerous because it originates deep inside the breast tissue, and is usually diagnosed when it has already spread to a great extent.
Experts say that by drinking at least three cups of tea a day, the danger of breast cancer can be reduced in young women.
They say that incorporating tea as a regular drink in your daily routine helps create immunity against the cancer.
In Britain every year almost 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer.

Why Reduce Exercise With Age?
New research
Exercise at any age is good for health.
It energizes your heart, reduces cholesterol levels, helps in keeping weight low, helps to prevent diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer's or dementia.
Unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.
experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active, however, age can affect it.
The American Medical Association says that Many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out.
Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.
She headed a research trial regarding heart diseases and the ability to participate in exercise in older age.
A team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart
The pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.
The experts focused on the left part of the heart, which is the main part for pumping blood.
They came to know ,that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.
Dr. Patricia says that as age increases the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear and this affects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garwin  Cain was also a part of this study.
He says that they were surprised to see that it has an effect, as it confirmed that poor exercising ability is closely related to the heart's relaxation phase.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.
If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart they can achieve the benefits of exercise, despite the increase in age.
A detailed report of this has been published in the magazine of the American Medical Association.
No Chances of an Immediate War with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief
The chief of the Indian Army, General Deepak Kapoor has stated that there are no chances of immediate war with Pakistan. However, to serve the country and protect its interests, the Indian Army is always ready.
He has stated that despite the commitments and international pressure on Pakistan as a result of the attacks in Mumbai, the infrastructure of terrorism not only exists but is also proactive in Pakistan.
He said this while talking to correspondents in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day tour of the valley of Kashmir in order to analyze both the overall security situation in New Delhi administered Kashmir and the preparation of armed forces on the borders.
He was asked his thoughts on media reports that Pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from India regarding the Mumbai attacks.
General Kapoor said that decisions in matters of peace or war are made by the political leadership.
Talking about terrorism in the land of Pakistan, he allegedly said that India will fight against the forces that are trying to destroy peace and weaken India.
He said that there are around 700 to 800 fighters present in Indian Kashmir, of whom almost 50% are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that only with the betterment in the weather, the efforts of encroachment between Pakistan and Kashmir under its government can be increased.  Although India has increased security on the borders.
They have refused the possibility of reduction in the number of army soldiers in Indian Kashmir by stating that one can't compromise over the country's security.
May Allah bless the tongues of the world and may Barack become a blessing for the world.
Though there is not much hope, we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan are effected by this change.
We shall also see what Barack Obama, who is the result of Martin Luther King's dreams, gives to the world.
Obama, part of whose name is Husain, taking the oath today, as the American President, is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance, but also a historic test.
Not only for himself, but also for all the people who supported him.
It will even be a test for the white majority, as for them to accept from their hearts, a black governing over them is no easy task.
Those here in South Asia, especially the Muslims, who have hopes about him should remember that he was elected the president of America, and Obama should remember that the president of America is actually the president of the world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th president of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
It is necessary for those who admire him not to have unrealistic expectations for him.
If Obama becomes successful in decreasing the religious and racial acrimony, it will be a victory for his fans.
What effect will this change have on South Asia, and what considerable change can be expected in the American policy in this regard?
How will this change affect the relationship between America and Pakistan?

Sir, whether it be Obama or someone else, the type of policies with regards to the whole world are decided by the multi-billionaire, influential, strong Jewish lobby.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts, the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is obvious to everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat that had a regular Army and Law.
They surrendered their rule to the government of Pakistan, according to a treaty.
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a step mother.
After the end of the governance of the King, there were no more schools founded in Swat.
Also, the areas development was not given any notice either.
Currently, the number of girls acquiring education is far less than in previous years.
The Taliban continue their attacks on educational institutions in the NWFP.
The largest number of schools destroyed has been in the district of Swat, and the majority of those are girls schools.
Not only this, but the Taliban have announced the prohibition of girls education in Swat.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.
What do you think the goal of the Taliban is by wanting to end the education of women?
Why has the government been unsuccessful in stopping these illegal steps?
What actions do you think the government should take to stop these illegal activities.
The question should be, what do the ISI and Pakistani agencies get?
Because the people of Swat have realized this was a game and that the army was there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them. Otherwise, how could five schools be blown up in a single curfew night? How could people be slaughtered during curfew and hung in the center of the town?
When the government is not being allowed to have any say in Swat, how can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps?
Now, the question arises as to how, when the government has an armed military, new and dangerous weapons, new technology and spy system etc., these four Taliban elements are not being controlled?
The answer is they have the hand of some secret power, which is why their weapons never run out and they are never arrested.
The conclusion is that the Taliban, through their dark activities, are making the work of the global leadership easier.
Fifteen years ago, the war was on in Afghanistan.
The ISI was controlling the Taliban while on the opposing side the Northern Coalition was being aided by Russia, India and Iran.
Then, suddenly, the situation changed and the Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of Dollars from America, so the previous friend became an enemy.
Now the scenario is that the war is still raging but the supporters in Pakistan are still the same Iran, India, and Russia.
Until mankind can understand the difference between whats right and whats wrong he will always make the wrong decision.
For example, if a thief intends to commit a crime, realizes it's wrong he will also fear his Lord and then he will not commit the crime.
Likewise, unless Israel inderstand it is wrong for it to drain the blood of innocents, and that there will be  punishment for this, it will keep playing Holi with the innocent blood of Gaza.
Greetings!
The question is whether war and terrorism are solutions to the problem?
If not, then what is the solution?
It is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but adds 'blessings' to them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development that Nelson Mandela used in South Africa.
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
kashmiri's participation in election shows that they have accepted his point.
Israeli attacks have gone on in Gaza for 3 weeks, and the death toll has reached 1000.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date, a ceasefire was not possible.
And according to a guess 9000 Falatinis have been left their homes and gone to save places after the attacks  starting in December.
Charitable organizations blame Israel for failing to care for the mental and emotional problems caused to Palistinian children.
What are you saying?
what do you think should to be done?
How is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Taliban should be given a chance.
Basit, Peshawar
Wake up! If the Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down the girls schools?
If kidnap for ransom, or not getting ransom so who will hang people on the pole by called them American spy?
These Taliban members have brought more damage to Islam than any nation or religion has ever brought.
Pashtoon Roar
Kohat, Pakistan
If the whole Muslim world just give a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see  how upset its father, America, will be.
And immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well.
But what can be done, where can our leaders get so much courage?
Someone should tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step since he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
The responsibility for establishing peace and human rights falls not only upon the Arabs or the Muslims of the world, but rather it is the duty of all the nations in the world to speak up against oppression.
This sad incident is the worst crime committed by Bush.
Just like in Pakistan and India, before the 30th of June or the end of the fiscal year the government institutions are looted. The American regime, just before its end, had given a green light to Israel to do whatever it wants.
On one hand, America says that efforts will be made for a ceasefire.
On the other hand, the United Nation is passing one resolution after another but both have done nothing practically. This means that united nation is also working  to crush the Muslims.
All the Islamic Countries should cancel their membership in United Nations and lay the foundation of their own international organization.
We have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations are seen, but the harm is only done to the Muslims.
What is the use of these vain efforts if the BBC does not want to publish anything?
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically of Muslims, is spilled, the monster of unbiasedness gets onto BBC's back.
by the way is a flag bearer of rights
Saying something from their side is a far away thing when they do not even want comments.
For the Muslims.
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, while you stay among Muslims, call yourselves Muslims and cause Muslims..
[syja786]
For a long time, BBC forums have been using a certain word, sometimes while discussing suicide attacks and other times, while discussing terrorism in India.
Extremism is the favorite word for those anti-islamic comments.
But who is the extremist? That you can easily figure out from the above comment.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal cannot be fought with the sword?
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what can one do other than cry?
But the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that we try to use the name of Jihad to disfigure the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existence of Israel, what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks?
The conduct of both sides is misanthropic.
The role of the UN and the USA was again seen as favoring the injustice of Israel.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
And we should think about giving the real terrorists an anti-terrorism Nobel prize for their painstaking efforts against terrorism, as after all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, would it be possible for terrorism to take place at such a large scale without the support of some big leader? And everyone knows who is controlling the strings.
In easy words, such gangsters are told to do whatever they want.
It hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry.
The Arab rulers are giving medicines for the injured, funeral clothings for the dead and money and they are asking
Israeli attacks, what should happen?
The actual problem is that the leaders of all the Muslim countries, including the Saudi king, are in a deep sleep. They neither have an army nor any protective plans. They think they can support and fulfill their responsibility.
They should immediately take practical steps against Israel.
For example, stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Salam to all brothers and sisters!
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is similar to considering them defeated.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature. The steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Now Hamas and Israel should cease fire to stop bloodshed.
Muhammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France.
Rightly said.
Suppose that Hamas is 100% truthful, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah.  Even then, they should know that if a good deed results in the destruction of an established house, it is no longer a good deed.
For those who claim to love God, love the messenger, and love their religion, loving mankind is a part of their faith.
As if it is the order of Allah to evacuate all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than the Muslims.
Najibur Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
The order is not to kill them but to invite them to Islam.
Jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion.
These people should be fought against unless they stop these conspiracies. This doesn't mean that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering.
Brothers, the end result of killing innocent children is destruction.
But I say to my friends that yesterday Israelis did not have a roof over their heads and today they are so strong that they do not listen to anyone because all Jews are one.
There are no Sheas and Sunnis. There are all just Jews and they have developed everything in every field.
In contrast, what is the condition of 55 Islamic countries?
They are behind in every field, and now the situation is that they have become so helpless that the enemy is killing them and they are waiting to die.
It is essential that all Muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
There is no better strategy than to recognize Israel, learn modern education and means of progress, and let the world live in peace and harmony.
Muslims have great land and resources.
The need is for proper usage.
The first and most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque.  This was impossible without getting Yasin and Arafat out of the way.
The world is witnessing how Palestine has been scattered  after the death of these two leaders.
and how the Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
In 1974, a Pakistani Prime minister was in such world power that he led all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100% attendance for the first time in history.
Today on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task for the whole nation to promise to keep unity in its lines.
Also, while eradicating the differences between other Muslims,  its (The formation of Islamic common wealth) mission will be carried forward
This is a Jinn, which has been inside Palestine for half a century.
this jinn have many face.
Many times this monster criticizes itself from a different mouth, to divert the attention of the world.
and this jinn other face eating peoples in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This Jinn fears Islam the most, as it knows that only Muslims following the complete religion of Islam practically can remove it. History proves that Islam has brought many Abu Jahls to the path.
Israels fighter jets start bombarding on Gaza and launched missile attacks on the 27th of December.
In this attack, more than three hundred residents have died.
After the air attacks, Israeli tanks and bulletproof vehicles prepared for war via land and reached Gaza.
Through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
Israel official said that they will continue action in Gaza until the rocket attacks on Israel end.
What should Israel do in order to defend them self? Will their action work?
What is the international community to do?
Does this intense action link to Israels upcoming next election?
What does newly elected President Barack Obama say after his past position on the middle east?

BBC searches for such comments and publishes them.
After all, they have to maintain the illusion of neutrality.

Zaheer Chughtai
In this art now a days; the Pakistani electronic and print media, especially some Urdu newspapers and columnists, are no more behind anyone who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism, or in the ""grudge of Muavia"" written on them.
It has been said that the United Nations seemingly supports human rights and peace but actually the Muslims are being subjected to extreme levels of cruelty and brutality. And what we hear from the United Nations is that Hamas should stop the attacks. How long will this hypocrisy carry on?
Why there is so much atrocity committed on Muslims. If people like Americans are backing up the Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So, Americans, if you have courage then stop supporting them and see then what their fate is.
The just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.
In the words of a poet
Atrocity is atrocity, it vanishes when it rises.
Blood is blood and it clots when it drops.
Now who will tell whom what is terrorism?
Is all this not included in terrorism? Why does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocents not red?
And now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere?
I watched the Mumbai incident, and felt as if my own house was on fire. The sorrow of those affected was overwhelming. If only there was a solution to this war.
I see dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood. How shall we condemn? I can not find words!
I feel like crying about the helplessness of Muslims, that on one side, people are dying in India, and the whole world is climbing onto Pakistan, without any proof and saying, take action or else we will.
And on the other side, Israel is ruthlessly killing Muslims and the whole world is silent. This is unbearable.
There is delay but not ever in the house of God. Only then will this darkness shed.
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Concerning elections, the rulers should do such things to gain people's support. There is no doubt about this especially when countries like Israel exist. Stop talking about Barrack Obama. History is a witness that no American leader has gone against this policy. They will not do it. A regime, whether black or white, is a regime.
From the discussions going on in the forum, it seems that everyone is hurt over her death, but as a politician, her mistakes have not been ignored.
This issue is debatable, as to whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was dearer, why did she leave the republic for ten years in the control of Musharraf, waiting for American clearance and deal?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the people needed her the most.  Unfortunately, she came to Pakistan when she had to deal with cases and was promised a seat of power.
There is no one remaining to say about the criticism and accusations of a historical personality.
Sana Khan
Some things should be ignored because nothing can be done about them.
Another reader.
Ladies and gentlemen, maybe due to studying the history, in not only Pakistan, but its four friend-nations and seven other nations, you find the arguments of Mr Psycho more appealing.
Tariq Ayaz.
Those who don't deserve such education shouldn't get it either.
The reflection of the pine in water never got to be green.
Britains never let them unite and established the Hindu-Muslim conflict, which was later on brought up by Sir Syed.
Psycho
How merciless is our nation? We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party, but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.
We have achieved lot of success.
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored, thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar if you en wreathe him with books.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks, Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.
If we talk of war then it will bring loss of life on both sides.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu but on the other hand when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader, point to be noted.
First of all, Merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and all our Christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
We do not want the flames of war, we want the flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
What problems can war solve?
Today it will give fire and blood.
Tomorrow it will give hunger and privation.
Therefore, O intelligent people,
It is better that war is postponed.
In your and our garden
It's better that the glim keeps lightened
The India-America relations have deepened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
This is that the old history of America.
Because in the case of an Indian attack, America's goals will also be fulfilled but the expenses will be India's.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation or ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied, even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
This is Islamic history.
Even before this resolution, the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
In compensation for the Mumbai attacks, the abnormal diplomatic and military benefits that India tried to gain, made it more a victimizing party, than a victim. That is why, in contrast to the harsh initial global reactions, the world has now reduced their force on Pakistan.
While ignoring India's unnecessary bobbery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a "Side Effect" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
There are no two opinions about this being a very beastly action.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not held accountable for what they did there for one year?
How many Taliban are killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday?
I appeal to the I.S.I, that for God's sake, stop monitoring the Taliban and let us live in peace in our heavenly hometown Sawat.
And stop this fake Operation.
The day is not far when a resolution will be passed in the United Nations against army intervention in Pakistan, the same way as it was passed against Jama'athud-Da'wah.
Riyaz Ahmed Farooqui
The extremists of our country and their supporters are constantly providing all the evidence and justification required for the instigation of action against them.  God forbid that the day when such a resolution is passed, in all likelihood not a single voice will be raised in the United Nations in our favor.
And supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Probably he was not a revolutionary.
The bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah, and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are eternal even after death.
But here, an international game is being played. Here ferociousness  and animosity are created to do the ruling.
So that license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will clutch the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so-called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
The supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of America, but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions, they give it the name of tribal traditions and clearly avoid it.
No person with a heart can accept these beastly actions, which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of Islam.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so clever that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are servants of Allah and so is the army.
It is very clear that there is something fishy.
Instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and punitive occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion, was seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
You have scared the world with the fire of hell.
You became the image of fright.
It is surprising when it is said that this cannot be the work of a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Upon the death of the Prophet, upon refusing to pledge alliegance, who burned the door of the daughter of the Messenger and pulled her husband out with a rope around his neck?
Had they come from somewhere outside?
Was the strike on Madeena and Great Karbala the work of Hindus and Jews?
Without accepting the facts, neither motives can be removed nor can they be corrected.
BBC people, stop this dual policy.
The title for this incident: "Was it legal or illegal to hit Bush with the shoes?"
'should have been
Tahir Chaudhry, Japan
Please show some modesty. A human was pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office?
the success of Operation Sherdil and Operation Lion Heart across the border depends on who is in the favor of public opinion.
This step of American and Pakistani intelligence agencies and Pir Sahib is the victim of this conspiracy.
All the comments on this forum would be against the Taliban because intelligence agents have successfully infiltrated the Taliban ranks and they are carrying out actions that can change the perception of the people.
I only want to ask that while this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public? They even report something like this: 'While bombing Taliban residences, a stray shell kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We say it with excuse, stop this game for Allah's sake.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000 in Swat went there to do.
The army's assistants were hanging the bodies of those who resisted the Taliban on poles.
Whatever the green-footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC, did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake, stop this drama.
The Taliban has destroyed the name of Muslims.
If the real Muslims do not accept Taliban as Muslims, then why do they get a refuge in thier places?
The ones who are shameless and don't do hard work and labor take arms in their hands and join their group.
Islam has not came under the pressure of gun or sword.
Have shame.
It's baseless has no roots in any religion nor in family customs.
All media including the BBC show different views on Taliban and tribals.
Infact nobody knows the actual situation except us, becuase we are the natives.
In short, its a game in which the CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a talib or a tribal. Who made these institutions? Warmongers--who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions.
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is the Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that the present leadership will end this cancer.
After the Mumbai incident, India said that extremists were behind the attacks.
Pakistan denies the blames and said it will give all possible assistance to India in interrogation.
India said that it has given a list to Pakistan of 20 suspected extremists wanted by India.
Now Pakistan has said that included in the list is Jaish-e-Muhammad's Molana Azhar Masood, who is not in custody and the government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before that the president of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari rejected the view that western spy agencies and the Indian government had provided evidence related to the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said, regarding Ajmal Kasab, that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned Pakistan that its relationship with India cannot improve if it's land is being used for terrorism.
And in the latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should these political events affect sports?
What do you see in the future of Indo-Pakistani relations?
Neither America nor India will break Pakistan.
Pakistan will be broken by Pakistanis themselves.
What do you expect after so much provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism.
It has been proven over time that Jinnah has not been good to the Muslims of India.
Yasmin, Chicago.
Madam, If  Mr. Jinnah's vision had been realized, neither the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism would have  spread in Pakistan nor would the Muslims in India have displayed such behavior.
It is our fault that we couldnt reproduce a leader of similar stature.
If we can't respect our leaders, then who can we respect?
This region has great capabilities.
God knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
In both countries the Mullahs, Pundits, Taliban, Shiv Sena, the RSS, etc have been established to oppose the progression of peace.
And the evil powers don't want this region to progress, therefore, these countries are controlled like puppets.
Can you imagine what status this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world?
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
May God protect Pakistan from any harm, Amen.
But sir, open your eyes and look around and you will see the current situation and ground realities revealing the extent to which the American have progressed.
Other than the national matter are not looking good as well, circumstances in Sarhad, Balochistan, Karachi in Sindh are in front of you.
In this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
O Allah, have mercy on us.
In my opinion, there is no way other than a last war.
Enough is enough.
Now it should be do or die.
This problem will not be solved with hypocritical deceit.
And neither with small big terrorism in each other countries.
After all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
and if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be stopped.
But our army rulers don't seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, America and Europe thinks we are with them in this war against terrorism.  But, on the other hand, we also help secretly help the Taliban.
We should think and fix our direction and choose only one side.
There is no doubt that the majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are also members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined  the party named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.
Although these members only did subsidiary activities, after India's great insistence The United Nations has invalidated the group.  The government of Pakistan is also  continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it's better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
Terrorist groups in Pakistan, support professional criminals and the heads of those are Mullahs who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.
Now, they are trying their best to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan of these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous persons or not?
There is no place on earth for extremist Mullah's who only work to cause killings.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What type of world is this in which it is very difficult to follow the preachings of Allah's Islam.
Non-Muslim can kill Muslims, but when Muslims try to take revenge then all non-Muslims along with the whole world think that Islamic preaching is done with Hafiz Sayeed.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-Pak relationships turned sour, for the first time suffering a severe setback.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-Pak relationships turned sour, for the first time suffering a severe setback.
India has always claimed that militant and non-militant groups which are active in Pakistan are responsible.
The up coming problems on the taluk ,has  been stoped.
The Indian security centers have blamed them for the attack on Mumbai, saying the Lashkar-e-tayab is responsible.
In this case, the name Jamat-ud-Dawa has popped up many times.
This is the first time that relationship between both the countries has worsened due to terrorist activity in India.
In December 2001, after the attack on the parliament, the two neighbors were prepared to go to war.
After that, in 2002, Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
On Jamat-UL-Dawa, on which a security analyst said that this is new face of Lashkar-e-Taiba asking for sanctions.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take action against terrorist group on its land?
Can putting a ban on Jama'athud Da'wah help the present Indo-
Pak crisis could resolve and for real peace in between two countries how important is that to finished groups who have weapons?
The Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all, what proof does the Security Council have to decide this so quickly?
Does the Security Council always show urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complaint and a fast witness.
If you see India has made itself as a Disappointed Country
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were brought to their knees by a few terrorists for three days. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have had success in every land.
When this beautiful religion came to ordinary people, then divisions arose between Muslims and non Muslims and a new era of tumults and quarrel began. Previously the world was not aware of this.
Salam: Please do it with pleasure but act on your own.
Do not do it because of American pressure.
If India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give evidence?
And why does it accuse us of everything?
There are extremist groups and organizations in India as well. Why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the world?
What is it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What is it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the first Islamic Nuclear State. Is this what the fight is about?
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamranhassan, ABU DHABI
Your speech is from the heart  like the situation calls for.
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all of these sanctions seem to be part of this conspiracy.
Americans are now not slowly but very swiftly tightening their grip over Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances,if we as a nation do not display unity and solidarity and if Bangladesh can be created, then anything can happen.
Terrorism is condemned, whether it is in a hotel in Mumbai or in a Marriott Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine.
These terorrists should be punished whether they are from Pakistan, India, America or Israel.
Now the question is that why the whole world, including Pakistani officials, are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack on the Mariat hotel a terrorist attack?
Then why?
Praise the worthy Advisor interior,Mister Rehman Malik,by the grace of God, how brave he has become!
No image.
not only this, but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under 'someones's pressure'.
Brother, Subhanallah!
Having this capability or not, that I don't want to say.
We, i.e. Pakistan, are fighting somebody else's war.
We have our own interests that we shall do our best to protect.
Nobody has the authority to interfere with any other country.
This does not seem to be the era of new populations.
If people expect justice or demand that an external united court be established to respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or military regime, there could be peace in the Third World, including Pakistan.
For example, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
Pakistan is forced to be so, despite the opposition from the majority of its populace.
This enhances the opposition viewpoint and anti-American sentiment.
If America and its Allies believe in Democracy, they should give up their colonial behavior and leave this region
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
Pakistani forces occupying Kashmir raided one of the camps of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India claims that the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba was involved in the  Mumbai attacks.

He said that the extremists whom attacked Mambae used Pakistani earth.
Meanwhile, Pashawar commanders say that unknown soldiers fired and destroyed 50 miltary trucks.
This is the second attack in Peshawar on NATO and American supplies in the last 48 hours.
Meanwhile, Pakistan made the show of distinctive party Lashkar-e-Taiba and before this was tried to make military persons nonmilitary and military weapons were changed with money and certainly no any action without it.
It is clear from the circumstances that efforts remain unsuccessful to dislodge the armed groups funded by Americans and Saudis during afghan war. It means efforts to restore Pre-80's Pakistan are fruitless.
The question is, is this what Pakistan really wants to do?
Does Pakistan have the ability to do so?
What is your opinion?

I ask only one question from the flag holders of humanity.
If you kill their children, will they come to praise you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan.
And question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies, say any logic, argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men, laborers and poor workers of different occupations, in revenge of American attack?
If your answer is no, then you need to correct your point of view.
People were armed, at that time it was dangerous that Russia will turn toward Pakistan after Afghanistan, therefore people were armed.
Now, when there is the fear that America will capture Pakistan via Afghanistan,as the American president  mentioned in his presidential address, why should we disarm them now?
It is because America and India will not have to face any public resistance after defeating the Pakistan army.
Yes, if any of them are involved in terrorist activities, then only Pakistan should take action against them.
But this is more, that government against Lashkar-e-Taiba proves correct by India that Pakistan is involve in that.
Najeeb Ul Rehman Saico, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
And another question arises, "did these terrorists not have the aid of some government or non-government employee of India"?
Are the terrorists born or made only in Pakistan, and not in India or other nations of the world?
As far as Lashkar-e-Tayyaba is concerned, it has no involvement in the recent incidents.
It should be kept in mind that Hafiz Saeed was the first Jihadi leader who claimed that the actions of the Taliban were a Fitna.
I am sure that the Taliban effect is an inseparable result of American plans. Hence, every person who can stand in the way of the Taliban must be removed.
even support by whole nation, take action against Lashkar due to Indian pressure indicate Zardindco frustration and butter up nature.
The operations started with American and Saudi funding, and has to come to an end. To do so, it should be requested of them to wipe out this filth that is consistently polluting our society.
One should also protest against them that according to ethics, America and Saudi Arabia distributed dangerous weapons and named Jihadis, but in reality spread the virus of hateful literature and culture due to which slaughter houses were opened in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, the announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan, and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly and tried its best to convince India that she should attack Pakistan.
This showed the strength of America in the region.
Although India did not even threaten nor does it have the guts to.
And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of the Taliban on American posts.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and the Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi is Pakistan's business and economic center, and Dubai of the less privileged areas.
Hundreds of thousands do not return empty-handed from here. But since the law was enforced on the western borders, Karachi has taken all the attention.
Now they are looking to kidnap this city.
For the first time, Pathans began to be called Pukhtons, and the people of a single town are made foreigners and are being made to fight, while the need is for unity.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speakers learn Pashto, or the Pashto speakers learn Urdu, or maybe it's better for everybody to learn English.
You will surely think this as a ridiculous suggestion but do you think that the reason for this conflict is not ridiculous?
The reason of violence is language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, I actually shared this proposal many times in my childhood with my friends, which included people from all religious and linguistic groups, but these people used to laugh at me.
At that time, the religious and linguistic hate which was not as lively and strong as they are today were still developing within.
I don't understand what is happening or why.
Are these the signs of the Day of Judgement?
For what crime are innocent people being killed?
The reasons are in front of everybody, those who want to break up Pakistan are the active ones and those who do such things have neither religion nor country.
Be it Karachi or Mumbai, the houses were set on fire by its own residents.
Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir mean that is what is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of the RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
The unjustified killing of Pashto-speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awakened sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
While the patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties has taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time it has also given American planners one more chance to think.
The MQM and the ANP are responsible for the turmoil in Karachi, and the government is only interested in itself.
The government can control the situation in one hour, but it is purposely allowing it to grow.
Pressure of political parties on police and rangers keep them from doing the operation.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
These kinds of incidents will keep taking place until there is pressure on the administration.
To me, these people are the biggest terrorists.
Foreign powers are definitely involved in this, but no one knows who they are.
And the sad thing is that if such a situation was prevalent in any border town, the government would take care of that place. But since this is far from the border, the government looks helpless.
The government should set up an operation here, and save a big and important town from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth due to fear, and as for the local media, it is even thinner.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is this that Urdu speaking people should learn Pashto or Pashto speaking people should learn Urdu. It would be even better if everyone learned English.
You will definitely take this as a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
Was language the reason for violence?
There was another story of cruelty recorded in Karachi, the terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
No one left any stone unturned.  The reports that surfaced in the media only told 50% of what actually happened here in four days.
I have spent the last three nights sleepless and the fear is still there.
Those who make the people evacuate hotels, those who kill the shoe-makers and the peanut-sellers.
The people who looted the super highway and cut the ears off of innocent people are all unaware of Allah's punishment, which can catch them anytime.
In your opinion, what are the reasons for this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
Keeping in mind the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in Karachi. It is simple and easy to guess that the turmoil is just due to an unconscious trade of blood.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control.
The blood of the loyalists of Liaqat Ali Khan also belonged to the same place. To eliminate Mr. Psycho's misunderstanding I am writing this verse.
We will also repeat the traditions of the elders.
We made it by sacrificing lives, and will save it by doing the same.
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
It is very disappointing that the whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
See Liaqat Ali Khan, you will find out that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family from Karnal, in Punjab.
Because of his efforts for immigrants, today the immigrants call him on of their own.
Every action has a reaction.
One can bear one's self, but...
Ijaz Awan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the graffiti of real gangsters these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been seeing both types of mischief.
Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan alone. They did not have to face any reaction.
Quite the opposite, they are pecking at the heart of Pakistan.
One Muslim League N was left. Even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to the People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment to the National Assembly and the Senate.
Until now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment are a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why  no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part. They will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft and that the government speaker did not take any action.
MQM is a coalation with the government. Muslim League(N) is a secret partnership with the government. The Muslim League(Q) is the party that passed the 17th amendment. Now, how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17th Amendment?
This is called getting credit for nothing.
The People's Party is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment anyways.
How can anyone think of getting his own hands cut?
As long as Zardari is the president, the seventeenth amendment is not going to be repealed.
This was the opinion of the majority in one of our surveys and it is correct.
If the seventeenth amendment had been canceled then Zardari would never had become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Musharaf because along with being the president he is also the chairman of the People's party.
As long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.
In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to bid Zardari farewell from the presidential house.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
Most of the elders in our family belonged to the working class.
In our childhood, when we used to see our uncles doing labor work, we used to pray to Allah to save us from this hard work.
To avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what we should do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor.
The editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and study Science and Math subjects.
We were inclined towards engineering and in matriculation we studied Technical drawing instead of Biology.
But at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.
We hardly studied biology for a month before we started studying math.
Fear of labor made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.
I remembered this when I was trying to lift the carpet with my two young sons at our old house.
It was not half an hour since we started working, and the younger son said, "Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job."
We said, "If that is true, then study a lot like us, and free yourself from bodily pain."
The son said, "I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work."
Anyway, the three of us finished that work in three hours and returned.
My purpose of saying this is that if a person has set a goal, whatever be the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving his goal.
But if you do not even know what you have to do, then Allah alone is your protector.
It is said that you should not say bad things about the dead, but what shall we do? We see only bad things in Benazir, even on the anniversary of her first death.
Benazir, for her selfish purpose, crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs after giving the list of the names of those who were fighting for freedom. On the other hand, she gave India the chance to keep its full attention on Kashmir after helping to suppress the Punjab movement.
A tug-of-war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history and has pushed the country back many years.
Even after her exile, Benazir continued to make negative comments about Kashmir and the nuclear program.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
During the rule of Benazir, she gave her husband the freedom to make as much money as possible, which is why he is known as Mr. Ten Percent.
In Benazir's era, her brother was killed, and his killer has still not been punished.
Despite being a woman, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
Just as Benazir did her politics over her father's dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came into power twice, but she could not punish the culprits of her father's political murder, as even she couldn't register a case against them.
It has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us, but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
We should have been observing December 16 as a day of reflection and making plans to prevent the reoccurrence of such incidents.
We should have been sending greetings to the people of Bangladesh on this day and been trying to bring them closer to ourselves.
The rulers should reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Biharis trapped in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
We have become so insensitive that if someone dies in our neighborhood, we're not even aware of it.
We don't care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines.
As East and West Germany reunite, I wish East and West Pakistan would follow suit.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem likely to be granted in the near future.
It was announced in the news today that the Governor of the American State Illinois had been arrested on corruption charges.
to remove him from the office of Governor, State Congress is preparing to start trial against him as soon as possible. One of our friend who has keen eye on the current affairs of Pakistan proudly said that this is democracy.
In America, even the higher level people are not above the law.
And the other is your country, Pakistan, where even the president was chosen after the corruption charges against him were dropped.
My vein of loyalty throbbed and I said what is the big deal if a governor was arrested in America? In Pakistan, once the prime minister was arrested and hanged overnight, and another time sent into exile.
Tell me, when did this happen in America?
Pakistan awarded the person who broke the law with a guard of honor from the presidency. When did this happen in America?
In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was suspended, and, besides public support, he has yet to be restored. Has that ever happened in America?
A holder of a falsified degree was made the Minster of Health in Pakistan, did this ever happen in America?
After listening to this, the poor American could not stop laughing and also accepted defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded on all four sides by Americans.
It seems from his smile
The America is with his government, but he is forgetting that last year the same people were with Parvez Musharaf.
This picture was passed on as if it showed a family.
Previously such a photo, one president with three American agents, has never been printed in newspapers before.
It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased and now more than one agent is needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.
It is also possible that this was done by keeping in mind the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.
If he was a smart ruler, at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo, and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting.
If the Principle of Democracy is applied to this picture then President Zardari is in the minority.
The majority rules the country according to democracy, yet who is in this majority according to the photo?
There are enough opportunities in the fields of counseling and psychotherapy.
According to the government, tactics along with force, and discussions have been going on.
Research has revealed that there are conditions which can be cured without medication.
The government must, instead of using the power, eliminate the causes of the issue.
By finishing the causes, Fazlullah and the Taliban will be finished themselves.
The Sharia bill proposed by ANP will solve the problems in Swat to a great extent.
In addition to the observance of the Shariat law, the administration will take care of the well being of the people.
At the beginning of General Musharaf rise, it looked like the nation had rid itself of the incompetent politicians, but the lust for power changed all his plans.
Whatever expectations were, after joining the 'war of terror', he began to consider himself irremovable.
The next logical and expected steps never happened.
As soon as Bush's era was near its end he started worrying about the end of his rule. In his panic, he made a deal with thieves.
General Musharaf was in a position to control the army, but the present administration doesn't know what is happening.
The army could not put down the terror in Baajodoh and Swat. The commoners are subjected to "bombardments and enmity", creating great loss to lives and properties, and launching them into psychological disorder.
Despite the military operation in Swat, a war-torn area of NWFP, things are getting worse.
On one hand the writ of GOVT is limited to a resolution of condemnation passed by National assembly while on other hand the influence of Taliban's FM channel is increasing in swat.
On the third side, the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
Security forces in swat have used lethal weapons and claim to have killed many extremists. Despite these causalities, the Taliban's power is rising and they control nearly 80% of Swat.
As a result, GOVT is not accepting its failure and the Taliban is getting stronger.
The poor citizen is the only loser.
Someone in Swat asked, "How are the Talibans?"  The answer is, "They are very good; they are fighting the war against the enemies of God."
A question about the army was answered, "Very good, it is fighting against the enemies of our country."
Then it was asked, "who are the enemies of religion and the country" and the answer was, "the citizens."
I am astonished how the Pakistani Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban.
They could not track down Taliban's illegally operated FM channel, which in my opinion is very easy.
But still, FM was spreading hatred in full swing.
First the girls schools and now the boys schools are being destroyed.
A curfew is imposed so that Talibans can move around easily.
Tonight eight trucks entered the suburbs of Mingora during curfew and created bunkers.
The question is that how could they reach there during curfew?
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, someone tell this army to protect the helpless people of Sawat from the Taliban and prove that the Pakistan army can overcome any enemy.
He says that most of the blood is spilled in the name of religion. Tell me, if there was no religion, would blood not have spilled?
Are Punjabi, Pathan, White, Black, Mahsood and other tribes the result of religion?
No, sir, no way! Only religion teaches that there is no black and white, there is no Punjabi and no immigrant. If it were not for religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between the white and the black, and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribe-brotherhood hatred.
Actually, religion gives moral teachings to the man. And binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here. And he should spend his life according to his rules.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France for two years I also felt the same way.
I do not know why people only expect us to call.
A resolution about Iraq passed in a few hours to send a "peace" force to Darfur was not a problem at all.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are consenting.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
Are people really waiting for it to finish?
So that no other victim will even think about using a great damage causing weapon like a gun to fight for his rights?
Even when a father is holding the corpse of his son, an ounce of sorrow does not arise from any part of your heart?
If not, then you don't even deserve to be called a human being.
rather, you are a blemish on the name of humanity.
OK, it was proven that this area was also the home of the Israelis for thousands of years.
Ideally, these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection, but since their strings are in the hands of the western and Arab countries, peace is not possible without their will.
Now even Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
Even if operations in Israel are stopped for the time being, they will start again after some other incident.
The owner of the BBC is interested in serving America and Israel, and this is why in the name of 'enlightenment' it has come out with a series of Zionist favoring blogs, and is seeding biased and blind propaganda.
BBC is only completing a formality, and its goal and intent is to gather well wishes.
I request the moderator to publish this comment from Fidwi, so that some truth may still remain on BBC.
Thanks.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How can he not realize that whatever is happening is showing the ugliest face of humanity
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time along with Dera Ghazi Khan, in whole country winter rains are going on.
Here is a poem for the season. Enjoy the rain with this poem.
Even these rains are from you
If it rains, it is spring.
If it stays, then it is peace.
Sometimes it comes without a reason.
Sometimes it spreads day and night.
Sometimes, it is very noisy, and sometimes it is very quiet.
Even these rains are  from you
in some remembrance some night
to a buried ash
Sometimes the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burned itself.
Sometimes every drop is painful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these leaders are about to run holding a very sensitive case. Little do they care if the country survives or not.
Let the population sell toothpaste or clean the bells of the Mandir with the peels of lemons.
Like our leaders, our media is corrupted as well.
Its sole purpose is to extract money from the government.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday afternoon something surprising happened.
All around police are running here and there but not asking about illegal parking.
Moreover, the NYPD was not in a mood to look at illegally parked cars.
It happened that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in the Hudson River.
Till today only this much is known, that the ""terrorist"" belonged to the family of birds called goose.
Yesterday was perhaps historically cold in New York.
The temperature does not fall this much.
Even my jaw started hurting from my half an hour walk outside.
Imagine what would have happened to those people who jumped from the plane into the river.
Happy news is that the people all stayed safe.
The sad news is that the ship of company sank in this financial crisis.
I went by West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, during my one-hour trip the way had opened at least a bit, so I was able to use the 56th street exit.
I had not taken the previous two exits, seeing the lines of traffic there.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, congratulations. Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammaar: Of course, with faith.
Shaguftah: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I had two chickens. It's a sacrifice. Janzeb will tell you how it was.
Besides this, there is no other way.
At this farm, one has to process his own meat, including removing the skin.
Basim.net might take some time to repair.
What happened on the forum?

To fight with "listen to the blog", use Firefox.

Sir, please use Firefox.
The snow will vanish.
We considered the Taliban group of Swat nonreligious, and they were only against education of women.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
Like the majority of the ideas, this was not proven right. According to CNN news, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a boys school with gunpowder.
Swat: The Taliban has destroyed a boys' school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First".  I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation of the Taliban being against girls education is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.

Masha Allah, up until now 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom, among Muslims, of fixing marriages before birth, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement made by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See the picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
Some days go, a girl's marriage with a dog become fresh.
Look at that groom.
Humanity is rare in the 21st century.
It is the age of the computer. The computer occupies a place in every walk of life.
Many people have reservations over this increasing involvement of the computer in financial matters.
Where use of credit cards bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
Now, with just a look at the credit card transaction record, your whereabouts can be traced.
and in future, when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent, its benefits will increase more and more.
Similarly, in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, the credit card information is stolen.
Similarly friends are also made through computers.
Social networking sites such as Orkut, Facebook and Myspace have achieved an initial level of acceptance.
But don't you feel that psychologically, the more we accustome ourselves to social networks, the more we are physically getting away from people.
Also consider match-making websites, where your preferences are matched to a list of people with similar desires as you.
Now can you spend your life with a person like you?
I can not. That is why a spouse is called the better half.
He/she will help eliminate my faults.
I guess I got a lesser part of intelligence.
Since childhood, whenever an elder said anything to me that was the truth for me.
And so I had assurance that my father knew the answer to every question in the world.
I was laughed at because of it.
But only that saying seemed true which could be possible.
It is very troubling that there is the need to tell lies.
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
That is why I try to lie as little as possible.
Don't tell lies, especially in the name of God.
and Allah willing say only when there is pray to Allah that work completes.
As for the intentions, only Allah knows best.
This is a disgusting problem that results from a distancing from religion.
According to our religion and the law of Pakistan, a minor should stay with their mother.
Their expenses are the responsibility the father when the father can meet them.
Then when the kids mature, they can live with anyone they want.
You are right that the actual problem is the relatives who misguide.
Possessiveness is present in all of our actions.
Even here, thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in father's property so it is resisted, although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated.
Here these restriction regarding relations have created many evils in the society.
The concept of remarriage of a divorce or a widow is getting rare.
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason for family breakups.
Why is it In our society, if the spouse of a 50-55 year person passes away,  they not looked at in a nice manner?
A Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago,  had all his children married, but when he married a widow, his own children went against him.
In my opinion, this is due to religion, is it not?
They said: "How could he consider having someone else take the place of our mother?"
I believe that this person's children should have thought what is wrong if he married a widow, after he married off all his children?
This widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
The children would definitely have gotten busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
If their wives deny to serve him tomorrow, then what will he do?
This is a result of pressure from society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society, which have been facing for the last 40-50 years.
A wife can accept her husband going around having illicit relations, but she can't stand him having a second wife.
If it's in her power, she will not let him do so even after she dies.
She destroys her husband and her own hereafter, and becomes a cause for spreading filthiness in society.
Nothing happens with the singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.
As for your question, the old man was going to the widow's house instead of bringing the widow to his house, so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax (though the stomach of the widow's children would hurt).
In the Indo-Pak subcontinent, Islam was accepted centuries ago, but it could not yet leave its' ignorant mentality and has always kept culture and tradition above Islam.
Thinking of a man's second marriage as an innovation, divorce as a clinical rest, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife, is all a part of this mentality.
Over all, by copying the western world, we are declaring the religious veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam was easy, getting rid of this way of thinking is very hard.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.
It took centuries to write this little.

Allah Hafiz
Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes, "I found this secret in my life that if the leader of any army is in the front line then that army will never lose."
But here, the situation is different.
They say that common people are there to die for us and they die as martyrs.
Yet, if a common person dies it should be considered murder.
May peace and blessing of Almighty be upon you.
Today, as I was returning to my shop after Isha prayer, a man sitting in a car at the circle raised his hand and drew my attention towards him.
I thought maybe this man has forgotten his way or maybe he wants to ask me something. I stopped and saw his whole family was in the car.
He asked whether I could understand Arabic well or not. I said, no problem, tell me what you want.
He started saying I have come from Riyadh but someone in Medina picked my pocket, if you could please help me? I said forget about it, because this has happened to me earlier. In return I gave this man 20 riyals to pay for gas and to go back to Riyadh. In stead he started doing the same thing after moving forward a little.
Angrily, I cursed at him and threatened to call the police, so he ran away.
Now the situation has become that we Muslims come in cars with our families to beg all day, and gain at least two or three thousand illegally.
Whereas there is a clear Hadith of the Prophet (SAWS) that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand; the lower hand being the begging hand and the upper hand being the giving one.
May Allah bless us and make us true Muslims (Amen)

Famous singer Adnan Sami's wife reached a police station in Mumbai, accusing him of torturing her.
The police station advised her to contact a court.
Adnan Sami's wife, Saba Guladari, submitted a plea against her husband stating that Adnan Sami tortures her continuously.
and treats her inhumanely.
Now this thing has gone out of her tolerance, therefore, a case may be registered against Adnan Sami.
The police, instead of filing a case, told her to contact a court, saying that this matter was not one which the police could touch.
In your opinion, is the accusation of Adnan Sami's wife on him correct?
Could this accusation be an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Let us know your opinion on this issue.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
As far as allegations are concerned, anyone can accuse someone else.
There's nothing more important than respect.
Whatever be the case between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he left his honorable life and went to India to earn money. Now that fame has fallen around his neck.
This is a consequence of his own deeds.
Washington...
Top American officials say that president Obama will take a strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
In America's new policy for Afghanistan war has been given more importance than development.
Officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achievement of American goals.  In his government there is corruption, drug business has increased, and Taliban are regaining their power.
American officials say that the people who are putting more pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more include Vice President Joe Biden and President Obama's representative for Afhanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke.
He claimed this policy arose after the end of the administration of President Bush, who used to video conference with Hamid Karzai every two weeks. Bush used to stress the American role in rebuilding Afghanistan and its civilian institutions.
Officials say that the Obama administration will work with state leaders as a backup to the main government.
Officials say that they plan to join Hamid Karzai in the fight against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing fresh elections this year and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his group will support Karzai for presidency or not.
Is this statement, of the American officials, a forecast of change in American policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is Hamid Karzai's rule coming to an end?
What is your opinion about this?
In a series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2-1.
In the first one-day match, Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka. However, Sri Lanka won the remaining two matches.
In the third match, the national cricket team's performance was very poor. In response to Sri Lanka's 309 runs, it only managed to hit 75 runs in 23 overs before going all out and suffering a humiliating defeat.
The result of the series proves that the national team has no consistency in its performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
Which aspects of the game should experts focus on?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
Which department will you blame for the defeat: fielding, batting or bowling?
Kindly share your opinion.
Malik Babar Husain, Jeddah. It is very sad that even in todays modern age, such ignorant traditions are prevalent. If the landlord or the property owner targets innocent people with his harsh dictatorship, who will call them Muslims?
A Sardar, himself should walk over these embers. Why doesn't the present government act against them?
When will we find justice through the courts?
The Sri Lankan team has arrived in Pakistan to play a one-day series.
Besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
On reaching the Karachi Airport, the Sirilankan team was given a warm welcome.
Two days between Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be played in Karachi whereas the third day will be played in Lahore.
Both teams are claiming assurance regarding bowling, batting, and fielding.
While the Sri Lankans are proud of their spinners, Pakistan has its fast bowlers.
Srilankan Captain, Mahela Jaywardena, has said that not one player on the Pakistan team, but rather the whole Pakistan team is dangerous.
Murli dharan and Mendis will be the trump cards whereas the Pakistan Captain says that it will be a tough competition.
Shoaib Malik has said that we have played Murlidharn and will see Mendas as well.  They have developed a secret game plan which they will show at the ground.
Will the Pak-Sri Lanka series be really as interesting and exciting as the claims are?
Who will dominate the series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Give your opinion.
Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.

It is all these people's doing Kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years.
No, no one  asked, now that they are caught in a war of extremism and terrorism so they have started talking about peace and settlement.
First they killed Muslims brutally, and now they are trying to resolve issues.
In a way, Pakistan has to understand their own duplicitous policies.
Asad Khan, London.
India creates situations that make people all over the world focus their attention on Kashmir.
Pakistan always shows the truth of India to the world.
Now the British government has realized that the Indian government is maligning Pakistan for terrorism so that it can occupy Kashmir.
They are unwilling to talk with Pakistan on this matter.
British Foreign minister David Milliband said that by resolving Kashmir issue terrorism will be reduced and the government of Pakistan can handle new challenges impressively on its border.
The President of the United States Barack Obama expressed a similar opinion.
British foreign minster has said that even though the fight against terrorism is dangerous, for their own safety they chose to fight.
David Miliband has said that Pakistan should show leniency towards extremist groups.
Under pressure from major world powers to resolve the Kashmir issue, India is creating unrest in the region to distract world from this issue.
Terrorist attack in Mumbai is also a part of this strategy.
Does India want to the allegations of terrorism its escape goat to avoid peace talks?
Let us know about your opinion.
Usman Aftab
I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
They in fact are thinking of ways to control Pakistan because they know Pakistan is an atomic power.
They want to create an environment for revolution.
Foreign countries are thinking that if Pakistan is cornered that will pose more political and geographical problems. They want to help Pakistan so they can achieve their vested interests.
A citizen, USA
It has always been a Hindu tradition; walking stick in arm and name of Ram on lips.
I think that they get nervous over small issues and then warn Pakistan.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.

This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but we know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is in hot water.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden, played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the Parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Dr. Qadir's chapter had been closed.
Does public protest against dictatorship have no significance to you?
Has the lawyers movement not played any role?
What do you have to say about this statement from the Prime Minister?
Let us know what you think.
American President George W Bush, in his last Press conference, advised newly elected President Barack Obama that he made many mistakes in his tenure, and Barack Obama should do what he thinks is right.
As President, I did whatever I felt was appropriate in accordance to the situation, American law, and Constitution by often allowing the American interest reign over my own acceptance.
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop it.
He said that, unable to find the weapon of mass destruction from Iraq was his major dissapointment and to announce the mission completed in Iraq was his big mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this was his last press conference, and he thanked the journalists and other friends who are present.
Do you believe that Obama will not repeat the same mistakes that Bush made?
Was it too late for Bush to admit to his mistakes?
Will Obama be able to follow Bush's advice?
Give us your opinion.
American Vice President Dick Cheney said, "I want to see Osama Bin Laden alive or dead."
He said that Osama Bin Laden is hiding in some hard to reach area and is of no use to his organization, and if Osama Bin Laden is arrested alive or dead then his organization must be destroyed.
America intends to arrest Osama and the search for Osama is on.
Will Dick Cheney's goal to arrest Osama be accomplished?
Give us your opinion.

The Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, has once again accused Pakistan of provoking a war.
Pakistan is using terrorism as a state policy.
while addressing a Chief Ministers conference in New Delhi, Manmohan Singh said that the terrorist elements are backed by neighboring countries, especially Pakistan.
The terrorists behind the Mumbai attacks used the pelagic route and were safe from the Indian Coast Guard.
The Indian Prime Minister said that the Mumbai attacks of November were carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba.
He said that the terrorists were using new techniques and modern communication systems. We will have to step up the forces at the line of control as well, from where there is infiltration. He said that terrorism will not be accepted in any form, and this is our policy.
How do you see this allegation from the Indian Prime Minister?
Does not the internal chaos and separation movements in India show India's anxiety?

Let us know of your opinion.

This is very hurtful incident that Israel is publicly massacring the Palestinians, same situation is here in Kashmir but Security Council do not even bother about it.
The Associations in Kashmir and Palestian have to fight for their freedom, and they must unite and struggle with dangerous situations. One day their struggle will result in good. Insha Allah
In Ghaza, the Israeli air force attacks Palestine and many people have died.
The important Political Person of HAMAS Nazariyan has killed along with his family.
On the other side the functions of the peace councils were closed, without any conclusion.
The meeting saw American opposition to the resolutions passed criticizing Israel by Libya and other Arab countries.
Israel's jet planes have been bombarding the residential areas of Palestine for last many days.
Each country around the world began to protest against the Mumbai attacks but can no one see this brutality?
Why are the leading Muslim countries silent?
What is your opinion on these double standards of the world?
Saeed, New York.
I think the problem lies in the illiteracy of our nation. People do not know how their money is spent. The government is solving its problems by introducing new taxes. The power and Gas crisis will remain unsolved.
Everybody knows the real faces of the elected representatives of the people.
The power crisis has become worse in Pakistan.
On the other hand, the price of gas has been increased by 18%. Due to unavailability of petrol, people are facing severe difficulties.
The business and industrial communities of Pakistan are violently protesting the power and gas crisis.
The producers have given the ultimatum to close the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is annoyed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
Production has become practically paralyzed.
The government institutions are blaming each other to express their positions.
Are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas a joke against the nation?
Why is attention not being given in resolving the issues?
The government is not working to improve the situation.
To solve these problems in the short term, what suggestions do you have?
I am aware of your opionion.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that government is carrying slogan of public service is itself hurting them.
The unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a persecution.
The government has no control over the institutions.
The law and order situation is getting worse, day to day. May Allah have mercy on this country.
The new year has started.
Last year was a year of outbreaks and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered for terrorism.
We will also remember the removal of President Musharraf from power, the end of President Bush's eight-year regime, Bush having shoes thrown at him, the establishment of a democratic government in Pakistan, sudden calamities, the earthquake of Balochistan, and the terrible global financial crisis.
Now that the new year has arrived, how do you think it will go?
In your opinion, what will be the result of the political or geographical situation? What will be Obama's strategy?
Is there any hope of moving towards the eradication of terrorism?
Will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?
What direction will Indo-Pak relations take?
Is there a chance of a surgical strike or full scale war?
What expectations do you have for the new year?

After ruling over America for eight years, President Bush left the White House, for presidential camp office, Camp David, so that the White House can be decorated and prepared for new President Barack Obama, according to his wishes.
During Bush's eight years rule, the historical attacks and destruction of the World Trade Center, attack on Pentagon and then in the name of war against terror, attacking Afghanistan and Iraq and involving forces from other countries into the war and use of American resources in it have become memorable examples of his time.
As a result of this war, America had to face the worst economic and financial crisis in history.
What do you think the world achieved and lost as a result of this war?
Were the policies of President Bush successful?
What is your opinion on President Bush's tenure?
The Indian Government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one-day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
The Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, Mr. Ragiv Shukla, told Geo News that he has sought permission for the tour of Pakistan from the Indian government, but due to current tensions between the two countries the tour has been canceled.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step? Should sports not be separated from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision harmful for cricket?
If an English team visited India Despite security concerns then why can't the Indian team continue its tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this?
Salman, Karachi.
Those people who feel proud of visiting India
and who make their films and videos over there, should now have their eyes opened as to how much the people of India respect them.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami in which he said that he is not a Pakistani national but a British subject.
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan at the first opportunity, because he did not get honor over there either.

India's attitude has changed after the Bombay Attacks.
Jagjit Singh has shown by his reaction that he hates Pakistan and the Pakistanis.
It should be known that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsle. How has he become helpless now? Adnan Sami should stay in India. There is no need for him to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam
Karachi. I will only say this about Jagjit Singh: he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! Open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Mumbai incident, their hateful statements have increased, and now they are spitting poison against popular singer Adnan Sami.
According to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said ""You dog this is a farewell kiss""
After this, the journalist took his shoe off and threw it at Bush. President Bush ducked with expertise and saved himself from getting hit by the shoe.
The second shoe hit the American flag.
Security personnels dragged the journalist away from there.
On this occasion, President Bush said that he did not know why he did that.  The shoe was size ten, he was not bothered.
Do you think this reaction of the journalist was an expression of deprecation for President Bush from the Iraqi people?
What do you think about this incident?
The tension between Pakistan and India's relations after the terrorism in Mumbai got further intense when the fighter planes from the Indian Air force violated the Pakistani airspace in Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
Due to the reaction of the Pakistani Air Force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
According to sources, both Indian planes were full of weapons and ammunition.
This is the first incident of its kind in the current situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that it is ready to defend the country.
Information Minister Sherry Rahman says that Indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed, although this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
Do you think India really intends to launch an air raid on Pakistan?
Is this statement of India correct? Was this violation  a mistake or was this to find out the ability of Pakistan Air force?
Will this incident cause an increase in tension between the two countries?

Respected martyr Benazir Bhutto was given the International Award for Human Rights after her death, which was received by her son and chairperson of the People's Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
This award was given to the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, slain Benazir Bhutto, in acknowledgment of her contribution towards human rights, in a function held during one of the meetings of the General Assembly in UN Headquarters.
The 60th anniversary of the passing of the human rights resolution by the United Nations was celebrated on the 10th of December.
Among those people and institutes being recognized for their human rights work, apart from Benazir Bhutto, were former American Attorney General, Louis Ramsey Clark and Human Rights Watch, an organisation that works around the world for human rights.
On this occasion, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Abdullah Husain Harun, and other senior embassy agents were present.
What do you say about the former martyr Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto receiving this award?
Samir.
Chicago.
It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember that she killed many innocent people in Karachi and that she was proud that Naiseer Ullah Baber had done a great job.
But later, she completely changed.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party and made her son the representative of Peoples Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Juma Noor,Karachi,It proved this Quranic saying that unbelievers help unbelievers.
Until the metal of the axe has a grip attached to it, it cannot chop off the wings.
Our leaders have a idea of this, which they are using to make secret plans.
God help our leaders.
The United Nations security council added the names of Hafiz Saeed and 3 other Pakistani's and Jamat Al Dawa and 5 other groups to the terrorist list.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaidah and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, practically non-existent organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba Operation Chief, Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
In addition, a Saudi named Mehmood Ahmed Bazeek was also added to the terrorist list.
Jamat-ul-dawa, Passban-i-kashmir and Alrashid trusts are included in these organizations.
The allied nations will freeze their accounts and funds, restrict their travel and they will be arrested.
They will have to face charges.
Are these sanctions the result of Indian propaganda?
Why does India make claims about this agency for the Mumbai blast without any proof?
Are the terrorism agencies not in India?
Does UNO, have the knowledge for these occurrence of blasts in India?
