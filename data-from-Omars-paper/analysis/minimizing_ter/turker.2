In many modern countries it has for sometime being fashionable to think that, by free education for all-whether rich or poor, clever or stupid- one can solve all the problems of the society.
But we can already see that free education for all is not enough; we find in such countries a far larger number of people with University degrees than there are jobs for them to fill.
This plan of education was implemented on 1990.
Because of their degrees, they refuse to do what they think low work and in fact work with the hands is thought to be dirty and shameful in such countries.
The work of a completely uneducated farmer is far more important than that of a professor: we can live without education, but we die if we have no food. If no one cleaned our streets and took the rubbish away from our houses, we should get terrible diseases in our towns.
In fact, when we say that all of us must be educated to fit us for life, it means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited.
Education is not an end but a means to an end. In other words we do not educate children only for the purpose of educating them.
When men become organized in to very large groups and civilization and develops.
It is possible to get freedom from hunger, thirsty, cold, heat and many diseases, so that each person can live a happier life than he could.
It means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited to his brain and ability, and secondly, that we can realize that all jobs are necessary to society and that is very bad to be ashamed of ones work or to scorn someone else'.
He further said that in May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with a lot of care and Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.
When Thomas Reed was asked this question that China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan so he said in his answer that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.
He said that its evidence is also present that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan has used the Chinese model. Later the documents received from Libya also confirm this.
Another question that is it common to do nuclear experiments mutually. Then he said that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.
He said that we also predict that Israel also has access to the results of this experiment.
Thomas Reeds was also asked if China is continuing nuclear proliferation?
On this Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and the design to a nuclear facility of Iran in its city Asfahan.
Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.
He said that China had been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Rome, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen via North Korea.

Speaking to the protesters, senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, Federal Union of Journalists,  C.R. Shamsi said that the politicians who used to protest with us till yesterday on the streets, today they have become rulers and are sitting in the parliament. Fearing a certain lobby of the media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of the journalists.
He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of Rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.
An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.
He said that there should be firm steps taken against the TV and newspaper owners, and the journalists should put a protest camp in front of the parliament to get their rights.
C.R. Shamsi criticized the governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, saying that employees were removed from his Urdu Newspaper 'Aaj Kal' staff, without prior notice.

The advantages of such an agreement are great
By his own nature as a man; this is my attack him, and death will certainly come to him sooner or later.
One man can become a Doctor, knowing that others will grow food makes cloths and build a house for him.
When men become organized into very large groups and civilization develops, it is possible to get freedom  from hunger, thirst, cold, heat.
so that he can live happily with the others.
A man living absolutely alone in a desert or forest is free from other people; but he is not absolutely free.
His freedom is limited in several ways, firstly, by the things around him, such as wild animals or cliffs too steep to climb.
secondly, by his on needs: he must have sleep, water, food and shelter from extreme heat or cold.
When men live together, on the other hand, protection against wild animals is easier and they can work together to get food and build shelters; but each men has to give up some of his freedom.
I agree to respect the rights of others, and in return they agree to respect mine.

Bitterness among Israeli president and Turkish Prime Minister
Rajab Tayyab Erdogan almost shouted at Israeli President and said that many people's blood have been shed in Gaza. And he  felt sorrow watching that people can actually clap on the reason of this military action from Israel.
Mr. Erdogan said that "I think you are using such words to erase your guilt and that in a high voice. But you killed people and I am remembering those children who were killed near the shore"
Shamoon Parez said that Gaza's pain is not Israel, It is Hammas who has founded dangerous dictatorship there.
A correspondent of BBC from Davis says that nothing like this has been seen before in an international economic forum.
Although later Erdogan said that he respects the Israeli president and also his age due to which he did not shout at him but what he was saying was miles away from truth.
Turkey is one of the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, but for the last few years there has been tension between them.
The attacks were not planned in Pakistan.

After the Mumbai attacks, the relations between the two countries were affected.
The high commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan gave his first statement about the report of the Pakistani investigations, from which it becomes evident as to what is within the report.
Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that as far as investigation has gone, Pakistani land has not been used.
It must be some other place, not England either.
These were the two places (Pakistan and Britain), about which I was in doubt.
India and the global brotherhood has put considerable pressure on Pakistan, to take action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan says that it has arrested dozens of people during the action against groups which were clearly involved in the Mumbai attacks.
Wahid Shamsul Hasan said: We are not trying to cover this up.
We believe in acting upon facts.
Our investigations will be accepted by the world.
We will try to satisfy India with the results (of the investigation).
Defending the delay in the Pakistani investigations, he said that to gather, understand and verify such matter takes time.
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that India took 45 days to hand over its dossier.

National Conference's allied party Congress also informed governor about their support for Umer Abdullah.

The role played by European Union for peace in Middle East.
Looking it from governments point of view, the efforts by European Union to stop the war in Middle East have been decisive.
According to Brussels official position the Shoarzan Berg group or Sarkozy's efforts are symbolic to the seriousness of the matter.
European Commission's Spokemen Amadeu Altafa said every effort is commendable  that can help a unified message from the European Union to reach the warring sides.
In light of the governments statement all seems to be fine.
But in reality the European Union is presenting a view of conflict amongst each other on this idea which is very sad.
European Union's President Check Repuplic's role is already weak.
In addition to it the internal turmoil has nullified the effect.
At the other side, the French President Sarkozy's role seems to indicate as if he is still working as the president of the European Union.
Despite France has expired its 6 months Presidential term
Sarkozy wants to play a leaders role and he can also do it but he lacks the authorization to do it.
the most funny situation is faced by the French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner.
he is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of Czech republic Schwarzenberg.
the problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the Middle East war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. moreover Germany has sent its special ambassador to Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance, it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.
its proof is the Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.
this is a golden chance for the European Union to do something since America due to the policies of George W. Bush has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial Crisis: Suicide of a billionaire German industrialist.
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany left a huge business group behind him.
but a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 to one Billion Euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle went into deep pressure.
Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had got to this position from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic powet.
After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quick, putting it on new lines.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm, Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have sanctioned 400 million Euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.
Therefore, after Adolf Merkeley's demise the Merkeley Group, which once existed, came to an end.
According to new statistics, the crime rate among the immigrants in Germany,
if compared with other countries, between 2004 and 2007
dropped from 22.9%
to 21.4%
In the view of Joachim Herrmann, the minister for home affairs of Baaveria, it has been a positive change.
He said: It is to be noted that the number of aspirants seeking German citizenship has increased.
The statistics would have mentioned the fact that most of the persons indulging in the crimes are Germans.
Based on this, a foreigner said when statistics of crime are taken in his homeland in 2010, the above mentioned factors will be taken for consideration by Herrmann.
Mentions have been made in his letters about Humberg except Baaveria.
Christoph Ahlhaus, an internal affair's senator belong to CDU, said, "When one does research in a scientific manner, then the results can not be predetermined. The results are based on the figures and numbers which are the outcome of the research.
Ahlhaus brought the attention towards an analysis report of 2006 prepared by a regional (provincial) office of Crime Prevention, in view of which it was calculated that in the crimes happening from bergdorf to hamburg, what is the percentage of foreigners involved.
From the results it was found out that the foreigners'
crime percentage is less compared to the overall crime rate of the whole province.
In contrast to this calculation, when in 2006 in Berlin, the teenage crime rates were analyzed, it was found that the teenagers having a foreign background was 7.44%
was 7.44 %
However certain political parties of Germany for example SPD, the environmentalist party The Greens, and the Left party Linkspartei (Die Linke) , are against the idea of collecting information about whether certain German citizens are foreigners or not, while collecting facts about crimes and crime rates.

reduces the danger of chest cancer in women under 50 years of age by 1/3rd.
The research happening in the Moffitt Cancer Center in the American State of Florida, has showed that chances of getting tumor of chest cancer in those women under 50 years of age
is reduced by 37%, who drink at least three cups of tea everyday.
It is also told in the research that it does not help older women even if they drink three or more cups of tea daily.
Specialists think that this is because of the presence of such components in tea that are more effective against such types of cancer tumors, which usually targets women under 50 years of age.
Research was done on 5000 women who had treatment done for Chest Cancer at Moffitt  Cancer Center founded in city Tampa of State of Florida.
Their ages are between 20 and 74 years.
Specialists compared their medical records and lifestyle to those women who are free from chest cancer.
Specialists also came to know that tea had its prominent effect on one of the kinds of cancer, Lobes, and it was reduced by 66%.
Every 10th chest cancer patient has this kind of cancer.
This type of chest cancer is dangerous because it is deep inside and usually diagnosed when it has spread alot.
Specialists say that having at least three cups of tea every day can readily reduce the chances of chest cancer in women of lesser age.

why reduce exercise with the age?
new research
exercise at any age is good for health.
it energizes your heart, reduces the cholesterol level, helps in keeping the weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer or dementia.
unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.
experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.
Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.
She lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.
The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart.
In which the pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.
The experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood.
They learnt that as people grew old, there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.
Dr. Patricia says that as age increases, the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear, and this affects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garwin  Cain was also a part of this study.
He says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this. And this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.
If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart, they can achieve the benefits of excercise, despite the increase in age.
A detailed report of this has been published in the magazine of the American Medical Association.
There are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief.
The chief of the Indian Army, General Deepak Kapoor has stated that there are no chances of immediate war with Pakistan. However, to serve the country and protect its interests, they are always ready.
General Kapoor has made the accusation, that despite ascertainments and the international pressure on Pakistan due to the Mumbai attacks, in his words, the terrorists structure is not only just the same in Pakistan, but it is also active.
He said this in an interview to journalists in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day trip to the Kashmir valley to inspect the situation of the overall security situation in Kashmir, which is under New Delhi's management and to check the preparations of the armed forces at the border.
He was asked as to what his reaction was to the media reports which state that Pakistan refuted the proof presented by India, about the Mumbai attacks.
He stated that the matters of peace and war are decided by the political leadership.
Talking about the presence of the skeleton of terrorism on the land of Pakistan,he said allegedly, that India will fight against such circumstances who are ready to destroy peace and weaken India.
He said that there are around 7 to 800 fighters present on the land of Indian Kashmir from which almost 50% are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that only with the betterment in the weather, the efforts of encroachment between Pakistan and Kashmir under its government can be increased.  Although India has increased security on the boarders.
They have refused to the possibility of reduction in the number of army soldiers in Indian Kashmir by stating that one can not compromise over the country's security.
May God answer the world's prayers and may Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, but we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan , effected by this change, are in our favor.
That what will Mr. Barrack Obama give to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams.
The oath taking of Obama as the president of America, whose part of the name is also Hussain, is where historically important in all the ways, is also a great challenge for the history.
Not only for his own self but also for those who supported him with all their hearts.
This challenge will also be for the white majority as it is not easy for them to accept that a colored man is ruling over them.
Those here in South Asia, especially the Muslims, who have hopes about him, should remember that he was elected the president of America, and Obama should remember that the president of America is actually the president of the world.
A little while from then, a person whose real brothers were brought to America from their own countries, wearing the neckband of slavery,and whose blood and sweat watered the roots of the strongest country of the new era, today the a representative of that very same targeted lineage will be called the 44th President.
Many people have many expectations from this man.
It is necessary for those who admire him that they do not make unrealistic expectations about him.
If Obama is even successful in somewhat reducing the hate that is spread on lineage and religion based lines, it will be a victory for his admirers.
What effect will this change have on South Asia, and what considerable change can be expected in the American policy in this regards?
How will these changes affect Pakistani-American relations?
?
My Sir, whether it be Obama or someone else, the type of policies with regards to the whole world is decided by the multi-billionaire, influential, strong Jewish lobby.
As for Pakistan, with regards to the recent Mumbai blasts, the injurious actions taken by India, Israel and America has been seen by the whole world.
Even after the creation on Pakistan the governance of Swat was in the hands of its King who even had his own army and law.
With a help of an agreement they transferred the administration of Swat to the Pakistan government.
But it's disheartening to know that our government treated Swat like how a step mother would treat anothers child.
After the end of the governance of the King there were no more schools founded in Swat.
And neither was the areas development given any notice.
Currently the number of girls acquiring education is far less than in previous years.
The Taliban are continuing their attacks on educational institutions in the NWFP.
Swat has suffered the highest number of schools destroyed and the majority of them have been girl schools.
And not just that, the Taliban have also announced a ban on education for girls.
Thousands of students are being deprived of education.
what do you think, by stopping girls' education, what the Taliban want to achieve?
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities so far.
what do you think the government should do.
the question should be that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
because the people of Swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them, otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that during the Curfew. How come people can be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing.
when the writ of the government is not being let implemented, how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities?
now the question arises that having an armed force, armed with modern weapons, modern technologies and intelligence system, why the government can not control these few Taliban.
the only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head, that neither their arms end nor they are apprehended.
result of the discussion is that Taliban with their wrong steps are making it easier for the imperialists.
fifteen years before the war was continued in Afghanistan.
ISI used to control the Taliban when there was the opposition from the Northern Alliance, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then, suddenly the situation changed and Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of Dollars from America, so the previous friend became an enemy.
Now the situation has changed but the war is still going on and those supporting them in Pakistan are still Russia, India and Iran.
Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.
For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play Holi with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings
The question is that, is war, armed resistance and terrorism the solution to problems?
If not, then what is the magic recipe that will bring out a solution to the problems?
this is right that war, is a destructive way it never solves problems instead it increases it.
Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq should adopt these models in order to get Independence which Nelson Mandela uses in South Africa
to fight more for social , ethical and subjective rather than armed.
kashmiri's participation in election shows that they have accepted this point.
Israeli attacks are going on Gaza from 3 weeks and death toll has reached to 1000.
world diplomacy efforts has till now not resulted in a cease fire
an according to one survey , attacks after 27th December has resulted in 90,000 Palestine leaving there homes and moving towards a safer place
on the other hand, NGOs has accused Israel for not taking care of Palestine Kids and said that one whole Generation of Palestine Kids are in serious cycology and emotional trouble.
what you have to say
what should suppose to be done ?
how is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Taliban should be given a chance
basit, Peshawar
Please wakeup, if the Taliban start doing the real Jihad, then who will kill the innocent people.
Who will burn down the girls' schools?
who will do kidnapping for ransom or if ransom not paid then blame people of being American agents and hang them on the towers?
these Taliban have brought such damage to Islam that no nation or religion has ever brought.
Pashtoon Rore
Kohat, Pakistan
if the whole Muslim world just give a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see that how upset will its father America be.
and immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well.
but what can be done, where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from.
someone tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step as he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
the responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on Arabs and the Muslim world but its and obligation on the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny.
this unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
Just like in Pakistan and India before 30th June or the end of the fiscal year, the government institutions are looted, the American regime just before its end have given a green signal to Israel to do what ever it wants.
on one hand America says that effort will be made for ceasefire.
On the other side, the United Nation is passing one resolution over another but both have done nothing practically, this means that united nation is also working  to crush the Muslims.
All the Islamic Countries should cancel their membership of United Nations and they should lay the foundation of there own international organisation.
Many examples are in front of us, where only promises and resolutions of America and United Nations came forward but only the Muslims suffered.
What is the advantage of these actions when BBC does not have to print anything.
Now, where have the principles of general ism been buried,When the unrequired blood especially of the Muslims starts flowing, at that time the ghost of unbiased reporting starts riding over the BBC.
Otherwise portrays itself as flag bearer of righteousness.
Saying something from their side is a far away thing, they do not want even comments
from the Muslims.
The difference between you and Jews is that they call themselves Jews and Martyr the Muslims and people like you live among Muslims, by calling themselves Muslims, to Muslims
[syja786]
Long time since, in the forums of BBC, a specific cult has been targeted sometimes in suicide attacks and sometimes in terrorism happening in India.
Extremism is the favorite word for those anti-islamic comments.
But by viewing the above comment, you can easily diffrentiate who is the actual extremist, in which almost a Fatwa of blasphemy has been pronounced for writing against Iran.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal can't be fought with the help of sword.
After watching Israel's bombings on unarmed people, what would one's tear-filled heart do?
But the actual blame should go to that terrorism and violence, which we state as Jihad and ruin the beautiful name of Islam.
Since the majority of Palestinians have already accepted the existence of Israel, does it make sense for Hamas to fire rockets on Israel or do suicide attacks.
Behavior from both side lacks humanity.
The character played by America and United Nations again showed us their support for the cruelties of Israel.
May ALLAH grant us, the Muslims, a way to re-unite. Ameen.
and the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism, after all they are doing the real work.
otherwise, is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are.
so in this situation, in common terms it is called DADAGEERI which means do what ever you can.
That it even hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry.
medicines for injured, and coffins for the dead are being supplied by the Arab leaders and asked that
Should the Israeli attacks take place?
this is the actual problem that the leaders of Muslim countries including Saudi crownprince are in a false sleep, neither they have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
they should take immediate measures against Israel.
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Salam to All brothers and sisters!
i think at this hard time advising hammas to stop struggling in the name of peace would be injustified with thousands of widows and millions of orphans, and it would be similar to prove them wrong.
If israel and its followers are at peak of cruelty then soon a revolution to stop all this is going to show up because this is the law of nature. America and isreal's steps are upbringing suicide bombers.
they can can not understand who are blind in trance of power.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Now hammas and israel should befriended to stop blood shed.
Muhammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France.
very rightly said.
Assumingly if hammas is 100% right and by fighting against malice it gets higher place in the eyes of God even then atleast they should realize if by good deeds peace of others home is shattered then that act is no longer a good deed.
those who claim to love God, His Prophet(P.B.U.H) and their religion, to love humanity is part of their belief.
consequently after muslims confiscation of everybody on earth is Allah's order.
Najibur Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
no there are no orders to destroy but to invite them to come to Islam.
but Jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion.
these people should be fought with unless they stop these conspiracies - but this doesn't mean at all that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering.
brothers, the only end to the killer of innocent children is destruction.
but I ask my friends that the Israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past have become so strong today that they don't listen to any one, this is because the Jews are united.
there are no Shea's and Sunnis, there are all just Jews and they have developed everything in every field.
in contrast, what is the condition of 55 Islamic countries?
they are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death.
it is essential that all Muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
and there is no better strategy, that recognize Israel, learn modern education and means of progress and let the world live in peace and harmony.
The Muslims have plenty of land and means as well.
the need is of proper use.
this first most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque and this was impossible without removing Yasin and Arafat from the way.
the world is witnessing that how Palestine had been scattering  after the death of these two leaders.
and how the Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
in 1974 a Pakistani prime minister was so worldly trusted that first time in the history he manged to gather all the Muslim leaders under one roof with hundred percent attendance.
today on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task that the whole nation promise to not only keep unity in its lines
Rather the incomplete mission (of forming a joint Islamic nation) will be advanced while still removing the differences between the Muslims?
This is a Jinn, which has entered Palestine for half a century.
That Jinn has many mouths.
Many a times, this Jinn calls itself bad names from one of its other mouths to divert the attention and reduce the pressure of the world from it.
It is another mouth of this Jinn whichis eating people in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This Jinn fears Islam the most, as it knows that whenever it is removed, only Islam, Mulsims and the complete religion of Islam being followed practically, in its followers can remove it, as history proves that Islam has brought many Abu Jahls to the path.
The series of bombings of Gaza by Israeli war planes and missile strikes has been going on since the 27th of December.
More than three hundred Israeli citizens have died so far in these attacks.
Now, after the air strikes, Israeli tanks have reached the Gaza border, completely prepared to launch a land offensive.
The Security Council of the United Nations, through an agreed upon resolution passed in an emergency meeting, have demanded that Israeli and Palestinian authorities stop extremist activities immediately.
however the Israeli authorities say that they will continue operation in Gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
in your opinion, is this claim of Israel true that it's doing all this for defending the sovereignty of Israel?
is the world community playing its role in such situation?
does this aggression has an indirect relation with the coming elections in Israel?
can any improvement be expected in the situation in Middle East after the succession of the newly elected American president Barak Obama.

Palestine will forever remain a sacred place for Muslims and its protection is a must for us.
and we should also remember that it is also our Qibla e Awwal.
Israel and India have to vanish one day since these countries are made to be broken and God will surely torment these disbelievers. Sajid Sadiq, Lahore.
"When has a lonely night passed merely by weeping
When has misfortune departed by praying only" (Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan)
B.B.C makes it a point to dig out and publish such accounts.
Afterall they have to maintain the illusion and impression of their neutrality.
By the way B.B.C news is factual but an essential factor is the tone in which the news is delivered.
Which news to be made prominent and which news to be considered as insignificant.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
Now even the electronic media as well as printed media of Pakistan, specifically a few urdu newspapers and columnists, are not behind anybody else in exhibiting this skill- who,while giving coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism, and while writing about it, hide facts about the grudge mafia.
Has been said that United Nations seemingly supports human rights and peace but actually the muslims are being subjected to extreme levels of cruelty and brutality. And what we hear from United Nations is that Hamas should stop the attacks. How long will this hypocrisy carry on.
Why there is so much atrocity on Muslims. If people like America leave backing up of Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So if Americans you have courage then leave backing up of them and see then their fate of life.
So-called writers and murderers in name of peace should understand that peace in the world can only and only be obtained through giving justice not through genocides.
If any nations can be perished through genocide and results of choice can be obtained then after actions of Hitler, existence of Jews and their uprising was impossible.
As poet says.
Atrocity is atrocity, it vanishes when it rises.
Blood is blood, clots when drop.
Now who will tell whom what is terrorism?
Is this comes in terrorism, why? because own pain is only felt.
Other people are not humans or blood of Muslims is so cheap or color of these innocent's was not red?
And now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere?
I saw the terror act of Mumbai attacks as my own house was set on fire. It is painful to see the sufferings of humanity.   if such sufferings can not be seen by others. May the Muslims think collectively.
Dead bodies on the roads, helpless and wounded people stained with their own blood. How it should be condemned; words are too poor to express this condemnation.
My heart is crying over the miseries and helplessness of Muslims. On one hand People are being killed in India and on the other hand, without any solid proof, whole world is pressing Pakistan to do more or we will do it ourselves.
On the other side Israel is killing Muslims. The silence of the world is intolerable.
It may be delayed but God will surely do the justice to end the dominance of falsehood.
A threat to Israel's security in the presence of US, no way! it is a joke.
In Israel, such tactics are used by ruling party to achieve public support.Historically no president was powerful enough to change American policies.Barrack Obama is no exception. Forces of Exploitation are similar in their character; whether they are black or white.
In this forum discussion, it is clear that every body is mourning the death of Benazir but she is not forgiven for her political mistakes.
It is debatable whether Benazir died for democracy or for the lust of Power.
If Democracy was her motto then why did not she come before American clearance and deal? Whey did she leave democracy under the control of Musharraf's dictatorship for 10 years?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the stratocracised public needed her, unfortunately she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised.
when each and every historic personality is being accused, there is no one to say any thing over this.
Sana Khan
few things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done of them.
another reader.
Sir/Sir probably you should not only study Pakistan's history but that of 4 friend and 7 other countries, may be you would agree with Psycho's point of view.
Tariq Ayaz
'those who don't have a good nature can't be corrected through training'
living green in the water made the reflection of the wheat plant look like a cypress.
Britain never let them unite and established the Hindu-Muslim conflict which was later on brought up by Sir Syed.
psycho
how brutal is our nation, not only we are blind while writing odes on ourselves and our parties but now we are picking, accusing and criticizing every historical scholar and no body is there to say any thing over this.
enough of development that we have made.
Sana Khan
few things are ignored just by thinking that nothing can be done of them. Just like a donkey can not become a scholar by just loading books over it.
although after the Mumbai attacks, there has been a setback in the dialog between Pakistan and India, however Pakistan and India should continue these dialogs.
if we talk of war then it will bring loss of humans from both sides.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu but on the other hand when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader; point to be noted.
First of all Mary Christmas to Mr. Bhana and to all the Christian brothers of the forum.
greeting to all friends of the Forum: Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, sister Sana, sister Shahida and Mr. Akram.
We want flowers of peace rather in the flame of war.
War is itself a problem.
What solution will the war give?
Today will give Fire and blood.
Tomorrow will give hunger and necessity.
For this wise people
it is better that war keeps postponing.
In your and our garden
it is better that candle keeps lit.
The relationship of India America have become deep and India knows that when the time comes America will openly deceive Pakistan.
It is the old history of America.
How ever,America will gain his aims in the Indian attack and the India will expend all.
Pakistan should announce clearly that thay will not attack first but when there will be first attack from India then there will be no peace and stopping war until India will be abolished and accopied and there is no any care of our killing.
It is the Islamic history
.  Before this approval, Pakistani public and force delivered the saying which they wanted.
The Indian efforts of receiving extra ordinary ambassador and force benefits in fulfilling Mambai attacks are making It clever party mare than impress so after the first world hard opposite action decreased on Pakistan by the world.
The showing of United States  andthe showing betterment of president of Interpol peace of mind at Pakistani efforts by avoiding unnecessary noise of India is the side effect of the extra ambassador of India.
There are no two sayings about this dishonest action.
But the question is that where was the Pakistani force and what was doing when thousands talibans attacked at the village of Pir Same-u-Llah.
Should the contentedness of force not be in action that what they did for the countay.
Every day Thousands of missiles and bombs has been thrown due to that how many Taliban citizens has been killed?
I am Requesting ISI, for god sake leave the Guardianship of Taliban and let us live with peace and happiness in our Heaven
And stop this fake Operation
In National Unity the day is not too far when in Pakistan the military affirmative will be passed as it has been passed against jamiat-ul-dawa
Riyaz Ahmed Farooqui
First our intemperance lovers and there supporters are collecting the evidence continuously for legal act are been provided, if any day any affirmative comes across then there are lot of possibilities that in the National unity there will be no one to raise a voice to support us
If suppose there is any delay for Affirmative to be passed then we can keep an example of America in front, so that any one of the power will join us to walk with us
We dont have the consciousness and Knowledge of Peer Sami ul llah his Personality and his Adventures and what work he was busy in
Probably he was not a revolutionary
As Kamri dach gaveera, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr Najeeb ul llah and thousands of Revolutionarys Dead bodies has been disgraceful by Enemies hands
They command even after they die.
But there is an international game being played over here. Here, they are ruling by scaring the public about beastliness and terror.
So that it would be permissible for them, saying that if we are not there, beasts and wild people will come and capture the government.
Such actions of the so called Islam lovers, in the name of religion is extremely disagreeable.
The supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of America, but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions, give it the name of tribal traditions, and clearly avoid it.
Any person with a heart can never accept these beastly actions, which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of Islam.
I think the people of our army have joint these people.
This is because, when these people move around, at least some time will be taken. To catch them will only take so much time. But, forget about getting to that spot, even if they were there, they escape from there.
Are these people so brave that they take 50 or 70 people hostage and our army watches like an audience, with hand on hand.
They are also servants of Allah and so is the army.
It is clear that something is sinister.
Malaiyat. In the dictator of the age, Ziya-ul-Haqq's dictatorship, instead of presenting the Noble and Merciful characters of God, an atmosphere of religio-phobia was created by the use of many types of narrations of punishments and incidents apart from the incident of the body hanging. Even the literature and books like 'what will happen when we die?' created fear and terror.
And these people are only using this fear as a tool or a weapon to gain worldly pleasures and honor.
preachers!
As you have preached against the fire of Hell
that you have yourself become the face of fear.
It is surprising when it is said that this can not be a work of a Muslim
We are either unaware of our own history, or we ignore it for some reason.
Upon the death of the Prophet, upon refusing to pledge alliegance, who burnt the door of the daughter of the Messenger and pulled her husband out with a rope around his neck?
Had they come from somewhere outside?
Was it the work of Hindus and Jews the strike on Madeena and Great Karbala?
Without the submission of the truth nor the movement was away neither the check.
BBC people close quadrant policy.
The super hit title for this subject: 'Was it legal or illegal, Bush was hit with the shoes?
Supposed to be.
Tahir Choudry, Japan
Friend have some shame, taking out one Human being from the grave and hanging him to the pole just because he has raised vices against the wrongfulness, and you are concerned about the title of the box office.
For the victory of the operation Sherdil and on the other side of the border the victorious invasion of the operation lion heart is dependable that on whose favor is the opinion of normal people.
These steps are of American and Pakistan Agencies and Peer Sahib was the target of this conspiracy.
In this form now all the criticism is going to be against the Taaliban because undercover people has included with the Taaliban very successfully and they are taking steps where normal people can change their opinions.
i have only the question all the day that what will the force doing when the dead body was hanging the hole day,are they sitting in country to kill the normal people those say like this two children and thier mother dead by bombing on Taliban houses.
Were they not know about that chowk?
Or they were seeing a film action?
We say it with excuse that stop this game for Allah sake.
At last there is a commander upon you also.
A question raised from BBS if it is not reasonable but alas on the sow thinking of writers,.for example it was asked from any person that for what purpose the force went Swaaat containing 30000 persons.
That the dead bodies of the helpers of force fighting with Taliban remained hanged on poles all the day.
What did the Pakistani force with Swati public what did but the media contain BBC did the world unknowing about real matter and it was not good.
Pakistani force is making drama.
Every child of Swaat is saying that this is a blood drama.
Please stop this drama, for god sake
The Taliban has destroyed the name of muslims
if the pure muslims of whole worlds does tell them as a muslim, they wont get any place to leave for the terror
Those are not interested in doing work, and not interested in leaving a peaceful life, and they take guns and join those people
Islam has not came under the pressure of gun or sword
Shame on you
there is no reason for this in any religion or in any families
BBC along with other media's has gathered information about Taliban
but, the reality is not even known to any one, that what is the real situation, we only know because we are tribals
BAsically it is a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD, and our ISI,are involved, there is no one in from taliban or from tribal, the was created by terror from above agencies, who are insulting Taliban, Islam, Madarsa's, Pestos, and Tribals
due to this action Muslims head down with shyness.
i salute MQM Leader Altaf Hussain, ANP and PPP leaders who are against this cancer it means talk against Taliban.
this cancer creates by Ziaulhaq, he left but also destroy Pakistan.
but i am hopeful that percent leadership will end this cancer.
India after Mumbai attack said that behind this attack there was a hand of Pakistani extremest.
Pakistan denies that blames and said he will give all possible help to India in interrogation.
India said that it give one list to Pakistan in which shows suspected names of extremist which India required.
now Pakistan said that listed name of Jaish Muhammad Leader Mulana Masood Azhar hide him self and government did not have any information about him.
before that Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari disapproved that image that western secret agencies and Indian government give evidence to Pakistan about Mumbai attack.
president Zardari said about Ajmal Qasaab that this was not prove that he is Pakistani.
meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned Pakistan that its relation with India can not improve unless its land is being used for terrorism.
and in a latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to Pakistan.
should these political instances affect over the sports?
what do you see as the future of Pakistan and India relations.
Neither America will break Pakistan nor India.
Pakistan will be broken by Pakistanis themselves.
what do you expect after so much provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism.
although Jinnah also did not do good to the Muslims of India and it has been proven with time.
Yasmin, Chicago.
Madam, if Mr. Jinnah's vision was followed, neither the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism had spread in Pakistan nor the Muslims in India had undergone such behavior.
but it's our fault that we could not bring up a leader like his stature.
if we can not care for our heroes, then
this region has great capabilities.
god knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
in both countries the enemies to peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv sena, RSS have been raised.
and the evil powers don't want this region to progress therefore these countries are controlled like puppets.
can you imagine what status will this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world.
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
may Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
but Sir, open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
Other than that National matter are not looking good as well, circumstances in Sarhad, Balochistan, Karachi in Sindh are in front of you.
In this situation country needs a such leader who can unite us as a single Nation.
O Allah Have mercy on us
In my opinion there is no way other than a last war.
Enough much has happened
Now this affair has to win or lose.
This problem will not solve with hypocrisy deceit.
And neither with small big terrorism in each other countries.
Even Europe too came to rest after fighting the last great war.
And if this Great war had not happened then they all would be chattering like Pakistan and India.
Almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be finished.
But our military leadership does not seem to be sincere in these regards. On the one hand, America and Europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism, and on the other hand we secretly help the Taiban.
We should think and fix our direction and choose only one way. Thanks.
There is no doubt that majority of the workers of Jama'athud Da'wah are the previous members of Lashkar-e-Taiba who joint the group called Jama'athud Da'wah Pakistan, after Lashkar-e-Taiba was rendered inexistent.
However, after that, the members gave preference to social work, and now even Jama'athud Da'wah was rendered inexistent by the United Nations, due to the pressure applied by India and the crackdown being enforced by the Pakistani government.
I believe that if Jihadi groups leave religious fundamentalism and take up social efforts, that would be better.
The present terrorist groups that bring up criminals in the name of Jihad, and the elders of these Mullas, are the same people who used to call 'Pakistan' 'Palidistan', and who knows what else.
Now they are not leaving any stone unturned in destroying Pakistan.
Actually, these are not even fit to be called human beings, let alone 'Muslims'.
Without cleaning Pakistan of these mischief mongers, the national security will remain at risk.
Can we still think about whether or not to put a ban on these mischief mongers?
There is no place on earth for extremist Mullahs whose only work is to cause killings.
This news tore my heart.
What kind of world is that in which it has become difficult for those who even take the name of one of the important parts of the religion of Allah, Islam.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims, but if a Muslim even tries to extract revenge, along with the whole non-Muslim world, even the hypocrite leaders join and treat those who have sincere religious feeling in the manner our great leaders are treating Hafiz Saeed.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-
Pak relationships turned sour, because of which the proximity between the two countries forming after many years, for the first time suffered a severe setback.
India has always claimed that militant and non-militant groups which are active in Pakistan were responsible.
For the relationships to return to normal, taking action against these countries is being made a prerequisite,
Whereas Indian security agencies have accused Lashkar-e-Taiba of being directly responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
The name of Jama'athud Da'wah also comes up many times in this regards.
This is not the first time that relationships between the two countries have become serious due to some terrorist activity that took place in India.
In December 2001, after the attack on the parliament, the two neighbors were prepared to go to war.
After that, Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned and it was included in the list of terrorist groups.
Now, it is being demanded that Jama'athud Da'wah, which according to security reports is just a new form of Lashkar-e-Taiba, also be banned.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against the active fundamentalist groups within its boundaries or not?
Can putting a ban on Jama'athud Da'wah help the present Indo-
Pak crisis to subside, and how important is it for permanent peace between the two countries that armed groups be dismantled?
The Security Council of the United Nations has passed the ban on Jama'athud Da'wah. However, what proof did the Security Council have based on which it showed such urgency.
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful state.
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salam- Please do it with pleasure but act at your own.
do not do it under American pressure.
if India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
And why it accuses us of every thing?
there are extremist groups and organizations in India as well, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the world?
What India is doing in Kashmir, what is that?
What Israel is doing, what is that?
the truth is; we are the first Nuclear Muslim State and why; this is the main issue.
Pakistan is now in last steps.
Kamran Hasan, Abu Dhabe
Your talk is near to the heart  and situations are also like it.
Now the printed new map of Pakistan is shown in American newspapers and the round of punctuation is also a sign of it.
America is gripping more on Pakistan slowly day by day.
In this situation if we did not show union as a nation then there is possible another part as Bangla daish.
To show disatbleness of errorism is less where will be it in Mambae Hotal, Meriat hotal in Islamabad and in Falastin.
Like this terorrists should be pounished where they will where from Pakistan,India,America or Israel.
Now the question is this that terorriss attacks on Pakistan and many bodies died by their attacks that what is the reason of scielence of the world.
Was the attack on Mariat hotal not by terorrists?
Then why?
Hats off to Home Advisor, Mr. Rahman Malik. Masha Allah, he has become so brave and courageous.
?
Not only that, according to BBC, the mentioned Mr. Malik has vehemently disproved this belief that the arrest of terrorists were being done at the 'request of others'.
Brother, Subhanallah!
Whether the ability is there or not, or whether it should be said that it is not needed.
We, i.e. Pakistan, are fighting somebody else's war
And why are there our own interest which we are trying so hard to save?
No one has the right to interfere in any country's affairs.
This does not seem to be the era of new populations.
If people expect justice, or demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan, which I think is not acceptable by those calling for unity.
As such, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
And this causes more opposing feelings.
If they trust America and the United republics, then let them leave the style of new populations, and let them work on those lines, upholding the sovereignty of the state.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
In Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, security forces captured a proved camp of practically non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India's accusation is that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Minister, Condoleeza Rice told the Pakistani leadership that there should be immediate action taken against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack.
He said that the extremists whom attacked Mambae used Pakistani earth.
Meanwhile, the saying of Pashawar commanders is that  unknown miltary persons fired the another point of United miltary truks and in result 50 miltary truks destroyed.
It is the second attack on NETO and America.
Meanwhile, Pakistan made the show of disactive party Lashkar-e-Taiba and before this was tried to make miltary persons unmiltary and miltary wepons were changed with money and cartainly no any action without it.
The situations told that in the past period of President ZiaulHaq  the efforts of Pakistan to end of miltary parties in the result of enterance of Soviat Union in Afghanistan and the resistance by America funding did not succeed.
The question is this is Pakistan wants to do it?
Is Pakistan capable for this?
What do you say?

I ask only one question from flag holders of humanity.
If you kill their children and they bring necklace for you, this is impossible.
Saeed, Multan.
And question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies, say any logic, argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men, laborers and poor workers of different occupations, in revenge of American attack?
If answer is in no then you have instant need of correcting your point of view.
People were armed, at that time their was a danger that Russia will turn toward Pakistan after Afghanistan, therefore people were armed.
Now when there is danger that America will overrun Pakistan through passage of Afghanistan of which American president had said out in his election campaign then why should we unarm these people?
Only because America or India army don't have to face any civil resistance after defeating Pakistani army?
Yes, if anyone of them is involved in any destructive actions then Pakistan should act against them.
but this is morn, that government against Lashkaray Taiba  that prove right India that Pakistan involve in that.
Najeeb Ul Rehman Saico, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
if accept that Laskaray Taiba involve that still it is wrong to blame Pakistani government.
and one question is also that this terrorist have a either get support of any Government or Indian government personal?
is terrorist only born and made in Pakistan and not made in India and rest of the countries?
as far as Laskaray Taiba has concerned they did not involve to this recent terror.
this has remember that Hafiz Saeed was the first person who called Taliban acts as 'Fitnah'.
this is my firm believe that Taliban acts was a part of American projects so that every that person and group need to clean out from the way who challenge Taliban in any manner.
even support by whole nation, take action against Lashkar due to Indian pressure indicate Zardindco frustration and butter up nature.
American said to end this campagin which start from Saudi's funding ask them godly now clean this dirt as well, which make our society polluted.
One should also protest against them that according to what ethics, America and Saudi Arabia distributed dangerous weapons and named Jihadis but in the reality spread the virus of hateful literature and culture. Due to which slaughter houses were open in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly. And tried its best that India should attack Pakistan.
This shattered the confidence of America in the area.
Although India did not even threatened nor it has the guts to.
And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of Taliban or American posts.
Thus it was proven that without the support of Pakistan and its army, America can not do anything.
Karachi is Pakistan's business and economic center and Dubai of the less privileged areas.
Hundreds of thousands do not return empty handed from here. But since the law was enforced on the western borders, Karachi has taken all the attention.
Now they are looking to kidnap this city.
For the first time Pathan's are called Pashtoons. They are made to fight by making them strangers to each other. Although the need is to be united.
One possible solution to the problem is this that either Urdu speaking learn Pashto or Pashto speaking learn Urdu, or whats better is they all learn English.
You will surely think this as a ridiculous suggestion but do you think that reason of this conflict is not ridiculous?
That reason of violence is language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir i gave this suggestion  in childhood in reality to my friends in which there were people according to classification from every religion and dialect but friends used to laugh on my talks.
At that time the condition of Jinn of hatred of dialectal and religious was not that alive and strong but it was brewing internally.
Do not understand what and why is this happening?
Are these the very same signs of Last day?
For what crime are innocent and guiltless being killed?
The reasons are in front of everyone who wants to divide Pakistan in pieces same are active here and who do this they neither have religion and nor country.
Whether it is Karachi or Bombay, our homes are burnt with their own lamps( we  have destroyed our homes ourselves)
When the government comes, they just change names of the places to build a name for themselves. Just like these days airports, roads, buildings are all named Benazir.
What has happened in Karachi, is this what Benazir means?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awaken sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
Where reaction full of patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties have taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time they have also given American planners one more chance to think.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the turmoil in Karachi and management is showing self interest.
Management can control the situation in 1 hour but it is being given wind on purpose.
Pressure of political parties on police and rangers keeps them from doing the operation.
Talks of getting united are only limited to statements, political parties should let go of their self interests and work for the interest of a common man.
As long as there will be political pressure on the government, more such incidents will take place. May Allah save Pakistan.
I believe these people are the biggest terrorists.
And there are definitely some foreign forces at work here, but I do not know whose?
And the sad thing is that if such a situation was prevalent in any border town, the government would take care of that place, but as this is far from the border, the government looks helpless.
The government should set up an operation here, and save a big and important town from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth due to fear, and as for the local media, it is even thinner.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that either the Urdu speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun speaking people learn Urdu or even better, both learn English.
Definitely, you might think this is a funny proposal, but do you not think the reason for the clashes is funny?
that the cause of extremism be language?
They spilled blood in Karachi and the story that each citizen was fearing for a long time was finally written.
No one left any stone unturned, and the reports that surfaced in the media was 50% of what actually happened here in four days.
I stayed up the last three nights and I am still afraid.
The people who killed the cobblers and peanut sellers who evacuated the hotel
The people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of Allah's punishment which can catch them anytime.
What do you think are the reasons for this sudden violence?

Keeping the heart rendering Mumbai attacks in view and diving to search for a cause for the violence in Karachi is not at all needed, rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in 'blood'.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control.
Liaquat ali khan and many Other freedom fighters belong to that. he was writing a poetry to remove Mr. Saiko Miss understanding.
we will again establish the old traditions
we gave Live for it and we gonna protect it by giving our lives.
Faizan Tausif Siddiqui
its very sad that whole country is on stake and we are still fighting each other
Mr. Siddiqui, in Wikipedia
we got to know that Liaquat Ali Khan was related to the province of Punjab, in the area of Karnal and belongs to a Punjabi Family
for his effort for Refugee, today Refugee consider him as there own
for every action there is a reaction
you can tolerate till your own but
I'jaz A'wan
Sir, before you get a large number of people with proposals, I shall tell you that the open signs of this mischief is also found on the walls of Karachi, in the form of posters and wall chalking.
We have been bearing both types of mischief.
Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan. They did not have to face any reaction.
Contrary to that, they are pecking at the chest of Pakistan.
There used to be one Muslim League (n), but they also made the rough version of the 18th amendment and handed it over to the Peoples Party.
Before that, MQM and Muslim League (q) had already handed in rough versions of the 18th amendment to the national assembly and senate.
It still seems that the copies of the 18th amendment is a political trickery, and no one is sincere about accepting that amendment.
This is why no fuss was made in the assembly or on the floor of senate over this amendment, and the parliament was not forced into accepting the amendment.
It looks as if the parties just wanted to get the thing off their backs by submitting the rough versions, so that tomorrow, they may say that we had submitted our versions of the amendment, but the government speaker did not take action.
MQM coalition partner of government, Muslim League N an underhand ally of government and Muslim league Q the party to approve the seventeenth amendment then how is it possible that these parties can be sincere to approve the disapprove amendment.
its just like writing your name amongst shaheeds by just putting color on yourself.
Peoples Party anyway is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment.
How would one think of getting his own hands cut.
as long as Zardari is the president, seventeenth amendment is not going to be cancelled.
this is an opinion of a majority in our survey and so is the truth.
if the seventeenth amendment was to be cancelled then Zardari would never had become the president.
Now he is even more powerful that president Musharaf as along with being the president he is also the chairman of the Peoples party.
as long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.
in order to cancel the seventeenth amendment, the political parties will first have to dismiss president Zardari from the presidency.
neither MQM wants this nor other parties.
most of the elders from our family belonged to the labor community.
in our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor work, we used to pray to Allah: that please save us from this hard labor work.
to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what should we do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor work.
the editor wrote in reply that we should select certain subjects and become doctors or engineers.
right from beginning my trend was towards engineering and I had selected technical drawing instead of Biology in metric as well.
but at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.
I studied Biology for hardly a month and then when nothing worked out, I took maths as an alternate subject.
means that the fear from labor work made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.
I remembered that when I along with my two sons were trying to remove the carpets from our old house.
It was only half an hour since he started working that the little boy said " Daddy, I am not born to do this"
I said that if this is true then study a lot like us and get rid of the physical labor.
The son said, "I am studying and I will get through it also but it is the work that I can not do"
Whatsoever we did that work in three hours  and came back home.
The point of saying is that if a person picks his destiny, whatever is the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving that destiny.
Here if you do not know what you have to do then God help you!
It is said that do not say bad about the dead. But what shall we do, we see only bad things in Benazir even on her first death anniversary.
Benazir, for her selfish purpose, crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs after giving the list of their names who were fighting for freedom on one hand and on the other gave India the chance to keep its full attention on Kashmir after them helping to suppress Punjab Movement.
Tug of war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history, which has pushed the country back many years.
Benazir continued to give negative comments on Kashmir and the nuclear program after being exiled.
Baenazir went against the pact made with Nawaz Shareef in London by making a deal with General Musharaf
During the time of Baenazir's leadership she gave an open hand policy to her family members to earn money, and due to this he got to be known as Mr 10 Percent.
In the time of Baenazir her brother got murdered, and his murderers are still at large.
Besides being a woman Baebnazir did not fight for the rights of women.
The way in which Baenazir did politics on her fathers dead body, in the same way her followers are doing politics on the dead bodies of her family.
Baenazir got to be a leader twice and in that time punishing her fathers murders at one side she didn't even file charges against them.
It has been 37 years since the separation of eastern Pakistan, and sadly no leader condemns this day nor do they call it a black day.
It should have been so that we would celebrate this 16th September as a black day, and take steps so such a sad incident never takes place again.
On this day we should have send the Bangali's letters of consolation and tried to bring them closer to ourselves.
Now we look at the reasons why eastern Pakistan was separated.
He would plan on bringing back the people of Bihar who were stuck in Bangladesh and he would send them gifts to keep their spirits up.
We have become so insensitive that if someone dies in our neighborhood, we are not even aware of it.
We do not care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
A huge calamity can pass by, but the next day we are lost in our day-to-day routine of life.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again, like East and West Germany became one.
We can become one again, if we sacrifice a little for each other and leave our selfishness behind us.
But this wish does not look like it will be fulfilled in the near future.
Today, when it was announced in the news that the governor of American state Illinois was caught on corruption charges
and that he would soon be brought to account for removal from Governorship by the state congress, an American white friend of mine, who had deep insight into the situation in Pakistan, he told us, showing off, look this is called democracy.
In America, no gigantic figure is beyond the law.
and there is your country Pakistan whose president has been elected after dropping of corruption charges.
my sense of humor woke and I said that what's wrong if a governor got arrested in America, in Pakistan, once we arrested the Prime Minister overnight and hanged him and the second time we exiled one.
tell me when it happened in America?
Pakistan sent off the lawbreaker with guard of honor from the presidency, tell me when did such thing happened it America?
In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was suspended in such a way that besides the public support he has not be restored so far, did it ever happened in America?
Holder of a fake degree was made the minster for health in Pakistan, did it ever happen in America?
after hearing all this the American went down laughing and then conceded defeat.
in this picture, president Zardari is smiling despite of being surrounded by the Americans from all four sides.
it looks from his smile
He is thinking that America is supporting his government but he is forgetting that a year ago they were with Pervez Musharaf.
This picture was passed on, as if it was of some family.
Previously, such a photo was never printed in newspapers before, i.e. one president with three American agents.
It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.
It is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.
If it was a smart ruler, at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo, and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting.
If the rules of democracy are implemented on this photo, President Zardari is in minority.
According to democracy, the majority are the rulers of the country, and the photo is speaking for itself who that is?
Paradise-like Swat is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
According to the government tactic so far, along with force, discussions have been going on.
But the use of force is not giving any benefit other than increasing the force of the Taliban and increasing the public favor for them.
what needs to be done is that the government, instead of using the power, should eliminate the causes of the issue.
by eliminating the causes Fazlullah and Taliban will automatically finish.
the Sharia bill proposed by ANP will become the solution of the problems of Swat to a great extent.
But besides implementation of the Sharia, the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues.
from the early steps of General Musharaf, it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians, but the lust of power changed all his plans.
all the hopes were from the participation in the "war of terror", he had started considering himself as immortal.
those steps which were expected, all broke-off.
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, he made a deal with the thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army but never know what's happening to the present government.
Either its Bajor or Swat, the army does not control terror but bombs the "Enemy" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy a mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy.
Despite the military operation in Swat, a war-torn area of NWFP, things are getting worse.
On one hand the writ of GOVT is limited to a resolution of condemnation passed by National assembly while on other hand the influence of Taliban's FM channel is increasing in swat.
The common citizen has no choice but to obey the rule of power.
In swat security forces have used lethal weapons and have claimed to kill many extremists. But despite these causalities, Taliban's Power is rising. They are controlling nearly 80% area of Swat.
Result: GOVT is not accepting its failure and Talibans are getting stronger
The poor citizen is the only looser.
"how are the Talibans" asked by someone in Swat. It is answered as "They are very good; they are fighting the war against the enemies of God"
Then asked about the army. Answer was "very good, it is fighting against the enemies of our country"
Who are the enemies of religion and country? "The poor citizens", it was answered.
I am greatly astonished, how the Army of Pakistan will fight against Indian Army. It has failed to  control a small group of Talibans.
They are unable to track the illegal FM radio channel of Taliban. I think that can easily be tracked.
This FM radio is strongly propagating the agenda of hatred and terror.
After the girls school, now they are demolishing the schools for boys.
curfew is imposed to facilitate the taliban's movement
Today night during curfew, they have made new bunkers in the nearby areas of Mangora.
Question arises, how did they reach there during curfew?
If Army can kill Akbar bugti in a cave, why taliban can't be targeted.
For God's sake, Army should take actions to free the helpless people of Swat from the brutal occupation of Taliban. This will improve the image of Pakistan Army.
He has said that religion is the reason of bloodshed; kindly tell me if it would be a peaceful world without any concept of religion?
If religion divides us on ethnic , linguistic and regional basis?
No! No way! Sir, religious is what teaches that no one is black or white, punjabi or muhajir otherwise if religion was not present, then half world would have vanished for the war between white and black and other half fighting over the status and sect.
Actually, religion gives moral teachings to the man. And binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here. And he should spent his life according to his rules.
As a muslim, I have total faith that Islam is complete way of life and a true religion.
After living in London, for many years I used to ask wellness of my family over the telephone every morning. Although many did not even call once to find out how we were. Then I realized that they do not even tolerate our phone calls so we stopped calling.
Living here in France for the last two years, I have also felt the same thing.
Do not know why people expect us to call.
A resolution passed about Iraq in a few hours, Darfar has absolutely no problem in sending peace army.
Bombay attacks were condemned in no time and banning dubious groups is only a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are doing consensus.
O caretakers of international peace! life is finishing here!
Is the wait really going on for it to finish?
So that some oppressed person would not even be able to think about using some mass destruction weapon like ill will to obtain their right?
When a father is running around holding the corpse of his son, even then a small wave of sorrow does not arise from any part of your heart.
If not, you have no right to be called a human.
Rather you are a black spot on the name of humanity.
OK, this was proved that this area was also the home of the Israelis for thousands of years.
Ideally, these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection, but since their strings are in the hands of the western and Arab countries, therefore peace is not possible without their will.
Rather, now even Iran wants to fight a proxy war from here.
Even if Israeli action has stopped for a while, it will start again after some incident.
The interest of the owner of BBC is associated with serving America and Israel, and this is why in the name of 'enlightenment' it has come out with a series of Zionist favoring blogs, and is doing a biased and blind propaganda.
What BBC doing is  just a formality. Primary objective is to earn sympathies.
I request the moderator that the commentary of applicant should be published to show that BBC still have some respect for facts.
Thanks
I don't know how this story was imitated but one is sure that dracolla of every age is thirsty of human blood.
There were wars and bloodshed in every era of history.
It is strange that man of 21st century, which claim more civilized, does not show any concern over open bloodshed.
How does he not feel that what is happening around is a distorted/worst face of humanity.
The most tragic aspect: how the current face of civilized man will present the concept of humanity to next generations.
well wisher, Sajjad ul Hasan, Hayderabad dakan.
At the moment in Dera Ghazi khan and in other parts of the country, it is raining.
here is a poem according to the weather, enjoy the weather along with this poem.
These rains are with your presence.
if it rains, its spring
if it stays then its peace
sometimes comes without a reason
at times spread over day and night
sometimes very noisy and sometimes very quiet
These rains are with your presence.
in a memory, at a night
to a buried ash
Sometimes it was such, that the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burnt itself.
Sometimes each drop seems sorrowful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What is it to them, whether the country lasts or not.
Whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them.
For one, our media is also corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government, and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday afternoon something surprising happened.
All the police is running here and there but do not check illegal parking.
Moreover traffic nypd was also not in the mood to look at the illegally parked vehicles
It happened that a plane of U.S. Air Force actually became a ship and landed in Hudson River.
Till today only this much is known that the "terrorist" belonged to the family of birds called goose.
Yesterday, perhaps it was historical cold in New york.
The temperature never goes down this much.
Pain started in my own jaw, after walking outside for half an hour .
Imagine what was the condition of those persons who jumped from the plane into the the river.
The reason for happiness is that all the person were safe.
The reason for concern is that the plane of the company was drowned during the financial crisis.
Seeing all those sites, I reached New Jersey Side from West Side Highway. There I found South Bond closed. What should I do?
Coming back I go wedged in the busy street.
Thank Lord! After an hour of hurry, a way was opened to me. I found myself at the exit of street 56.
I had not come across the exit first, nor the long lines.
Mekki: My Pakistan..! Good greetings. Eid Mubarak to you.
Umar: Ofcourse, Faithful.!
Shugfath: Good greetings..! Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I have had two chickens. It's a sacrifice. Janzeb will tell you how it was.
There was no other option. Otherwise, I would have to go to the farm
and prepare the meat, skin it off too.
Basim: .Net might take some to repair.
what happened on the forum?
Linko
in order to work with Listen to Blog, see it in Fire Fox.
Duffer: same to you, Eid Greetings to you.
Sir please use Fire Fox.
the snow will vanish.
we unnecessarily kept thinking of these Taliban of Swat as indelicate but who were only unhappy over women's education.
they kept expressing their grief by demolishing a women's school and college somewhere every day.
but just like other ideas, this idea did not also come true, according to this report by CNN, today on the sacred day of Monday this Taliban gang of Swat have blasted a boy's school.
In Swat,the Taliban pulled down the school of students.
The schools of girls were pulled down first in the cause of famous English school Ladies First and I do not that the people why did not consider Talibab free of crimes.
It is also known that it is wrong that Taliban are only against the education of girls.
not this but the wonderful that they are against total education.
These freedom fighters are gifted more power and the Devil
which is commanding us and he is helped to abolish it.
Amin after it Amin.
Wonderful,120 school have been pulled down yet.
The tradition of engagement before birth in Muslims,to marriage with Quran in order to control inherits and the insistence of many mufties that the girl became adult and sensible in 8 years it was not minor it is not only but in India a girl was married with a frog.
Sea the pictures pictured on the time of marriage.
Sometime before this a girl was married to a dog.
Lets see that groom.
Humanity has ceased to exist in the twenty first century.
This is the time of the computers and their role in our lives is ever increasing.
A lot of people have reservations on so much dependence on computers in our lives, specially in case of financial or monetary matters.
Where there are certain comforts by the use of credit cards on the other hand law enforcement agencies are also getting to know more about you.
That now with just looking at the credit card transactions record your whereabouts can be traced.
and when in the future the use of real paper money will get limited the benefits of plastic cards will increase more compared to today.
That is why now in crime it is preferred to steal credit card information rather than looting a bank.
Similarly computer has provided means for  friendship or networking.
Social Networking sites like Orkut, Facebook and my space comes in first tear when compared according to popularity.
But don't u feel Psychologically  that the more we are accustoming ourselves to social networks we are physically getting away from people.
Like Match making websites which match your choices to other peoples choices to find similarities and you get a list of such matches.
Now can you spend your life with a person exactly like you ?
I can't, that's why we can compromise of a life partner who is half or partly similar to you.
So the lacking of mine can be compensated by the partner.
I guess i got a lesser part of intelligence
Since childhood when ever an elder said anything to me that was the truth for me.
This is how I got to believe that dad has the answer to every question in the world.
People used to make a lot of jokes about me on this.
the only thing that look truth is which can be done in real.
its frustrating,what is the necessity to speak lie
due to this reason he suffered in this age as well
it is always my wish to speak lie as less as i can
don't say lie specially in the name of God
and say Inshallah only when the prayers is only for the God that he will accomplish it
rest God Knows all abut your will
this is the Only complicated problem due to the distance from  the religion.
According to Our Religion and the Law of Pakistan Minor should stay with their Mother.
there expenses are on the father and father can meet them.
Then when the kids get mature, they can live with anyone they want.
You have rightly said about the misunderstandings relatives create.
Our behavior is over taken by feudal thinking
Ever here this way of thinking is working that new co-sharers will be born in father's property and this is where the opposition is shown. Otherwise their father's this behavior is worth praise and pursuance.
With reference to relationships, these forceful affiliation has created evil in our society.
Concept of marriage of a divorced or a widow is ending.
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason family breakups.
In our society, if wife of a 50-55 year old man or husband of a woman goes to the next world and he marries again, why is he not respected?
There is a Pakistani uncle living close to us, his wife passed away around 10-12 years ago. Now after all his children got married, he married a widow, for which his kids have turned against him.
In my point of view, it is their religious right, what do you say?
"To take place of our mother in the being of our mother" what kind of thinking?
According to my thinking his sons should thik that what did he done wrong when he married with widdow after the merriage of children?
By this that widdow got a helper and he got a person to manage his home.
Because his sons and daughters engaged in their life and will not care him.
Its reason is lack of knowledge.
Tommorow if their wifes denayed to serve him then what will he do?
It is the result of the stress of society.
When the people laugh on such family at such action so the sons denay the second merriage.
Although we should compete such situation that their father's doing was according to Islam.
It is a curse in our society we are caught in it from 40 to 50 years.
The feeling of a wife is, her husband can do lots of bad things whatever it may be, but he doesnot has the marry again
if she has the potency she will try even after her death
Along with her husband, she also losing the life after death, and she is one for the evils things in the environment
Saying Islam, Islam from the mouth does not do any thing, we like the thing which are there in rituals
like, demotivation for the girls education, and love marriage, etc.,
now your Question is, if the big brother rather bringing the widow to his home, he might have went to her home itself, then there will no querrals from his children, (they quarrel may be in the widows children)
We embraced Islam even before the separation of hindustan and Pakistan, but we have not came out of such evil thinking and this ritual are a more important than islam
The second marriage of a man is bad, Divorce is known to be bad, The divorced women is a untouchability sin, love marriage is the bad impression, the marriage of a man with a elder woman is said to be the evil plan of the woman. the above things are of such evil thinkings
and we think that if we wont follow modernism, we considered to a old thinking man
Embracing islam is easy, but to come out from such evil thinking is some what impossible
Allah bless us with the ability and courage to do this task.
Ameen.
It was never that difficult to write Urdu.
It took century's to write this little.
Think of this less as a lot.
Good Bye.
Ameer Taimur in his book "I am Taimur" writes I found the secret in my living time that if the commander of any army is present on the front line then that army will never be defeated.
But here the things are altogether different.
They say the population is by default for getting killed for us.
If anyone dies from the population, it is considered Murder.
May peace and blessing of Almighty be upon you.
I was coming back to my shop after the Isha prayer tonight, a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called.
I thought that probable this man has lost his way or wants to ask something, I stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car.
he asked me if I could speak and understand Arabic, I said no problem, you tell me what's up?
he started telling that he has come from Riyadh and here in Medina someone picked my pocket, kindly help me. I said please go away brother, since such an incident has already taken place with me that I gave this man 12 riyals so that he could reach Riyadh, but he started doing the same after moving a little farther.
I was furious, I cursed him and threatened him of the Police, then he ran away.
this is the situation of Muslims now that even for begging we ride our cars along with our families and make at least 2 to 3 thousand a day.
However there is a clear Hadith (SAAW) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one.
May Allah bless us and make us true Muslims (Amen)

The wife of famous singer Adnan Sami approached a Police Station in Mumbai, accusing him of torture.
The Police Station advised her to approach the court.
Saba Galadari the wife of Adnan Sami gave an application against her husband that Adnan Sami continuously tortures her
and he is also administering in human behavior against her.
Now this thing has gone out of her tolerance, therefore, a case may be registered against Adnan Sami.
Police  station has advised her to approach the court instead of registering  the case, on the plea that the case is not within the valid jurisdiction of police station
Do you think that the accusation on Adnan Sami by his wife is correct?
Can this accusation is an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Inform us about your opinion on the Subject.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
as far as allegations are concerned, anyone can post it on someone else.
nothing comes before prestige.
however may be the relations between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he left his respectful life and went to India to make money and now this fame has caught him badly.
this is a consequence of his own deeds.
Washington...
top American officials say that president Obama will take strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
in the new American policy over Afghanistan, there is more emphasis on war than development.
officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achievement of American goals Since in his government, there is corruption, drugs business has increased and Taliban are regaining their power.
American officials say that people, who are putting more pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more, include vice president Joe Biden and President Obama's representative for Afhanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke.
He said that the strategy came forward after President Bush left. He participated in video conference with Hamid Karzay every fortnight. Those conferences emphasized America's role in reconstructing Afghanistan and its cities.
The American officer says that the Central administration under Obama will work with local leaders for a change.
The officer says stress will be given in the fight against corruption joining hands with the Karzay administration.
Hamid Karzay is going to face a new election and it is not still clear whether Obama and his friends will support Karzay's candidature for Presidentship.
Can we predict whether the declaration of the American Officer will effect a policy change in the Afghan affairs?
Whether Hamid Karzay's rule is coming to an end?
What do you think about it?
SriLanka beat Pakistan in the three one day international cricket match series for 2-1.
In the first one day match Pakistan defeated SriLanka, however SriLanka won the remaining two matches.
In the third one day match the performance of the national team was too awesome. The team chasing a target of 309 runs of SriLanka was able score only 75 in 23 overs.The national team should thus have learnt a lesson from this defeat.
From the results of the series, it becomes evident that the performance of the national cricket team is not consistent.
Despite home ground and all claims, the national team suffered defeat. What do you think are the reasons?
Which aspects of the game should experts focus on?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
Which part do you place the responsibility of the loss on, fielding, batting or bowling?
Let us know of your opinion.
Malik Babar Husain, Jeddah. It is very sad that even in todays modern age, such ignorant traditions are prevalent. If the landlord or the property owner targets innocent people with his harsh dictatorship, who will call them Muslims?
Let any big shot walk on these burning coals. Why does the government allow them to do that?
When will court justice come into play?

Gulfam, London, Publish statements that are of liking, you give preference to those too, it is our wish that even you write some truth, do not entangle the statement like Mukher Jee because it is commanded to say truth in front of tyrant and it is equal to Crusade(Jihad). What to say of Mukher Jee, change the statement between news and try to weep.

It is all these people's doing Kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years.
No, no one  asked, now they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism so they have started talking about peace and settlement.
First they generally massacred Muslims now they are perplexedly settling the matters.
In any way Pakistan has to understand their duplicitous policies.
Asad Khan London
India creates such situations that world concentration on Kashmir turn back.
but Pakistan always shows India real face to the world.
now British government also understand that India made a bad image of Pakistan on the name of terrorism to turn back eyes on Kashmir occupation.
and frustrated to talk this matter with Pakistan
British Foreign minister David Milliband said that by resolving Kashmir issue terrorism will eliminate and government of Pakistan can handle new challenges impressively on its border.
its clear that before that newly elected American president Barack Obama also give his thoughts in a same manner.
British foreign minster while talk with media and writes on one essay that though of fight against terrorism is wrong for challenge of danger for its own safety killed people is the policy of Bush.
David Milliband said that Pakistan did not show a soft corner for terrorist groups.
due to pressure from big powers to resolve conflict of Kashmir is India tries to create intense environment in this region to turn back concentration from this problem?
either Mumbai terrorism is a part of this conspiracy?
Does India wants to use terrorism as a means to avoid a dialogue ?
Let us know about you opinion
Usman Aftab
I think it is the big powers (countries) that want to harm Pakistan.
In fact are thinking of means to control Pakistan. They know Pakistan is an atomic power.
They want to create an environment of a revolution.
Foreign counties are thinking that if Pakistan is cornered that will pose more political and geographical problems. They want to help Pakistan and want to achieve their vested interests.
A citizen of USA.
It has always been Hindu's tradition 'walking stick in arm and name of Ram (Hindu God)on lips'
I think from time to time there is an anxiety and to relieve that Pakistan is blamed or associated with some negative event.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.

Ras al Khaima, This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is in how deep waters.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers movement not played any role?

The conference was conducted against Isreal by Libya and other gulf countries, and the report was submitted to America
From the last few days there has been bombing by Israeli planes on the Palestinian civilian population.
The whole world cried out about the Mumbai issue, but the Israeli attacks do not seem a massacre to anyone including America and Britain.
Why are the important Islamic countries quiet?
What do you want to say about this double standard of the world?

I think that actually, most of our people are illiterate. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties, the electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has taken a serious position.
On the other side, there was an increase of an average of 18% in gas rates, while the unavailability of petrol in some cities has become a cause of great difficulty for the public.
Among the manufacturing and business circles, there are strong protests and severe reactions going on, to the long power cut and gas crisis.
Industrialist have given an ultimatum before closing the factories.
Here there is growing anxiety among those dwelling in  Karachi because of eight to ten hours electricity load shedding
Industrial activities have almost paralyzed.
Government department are playing a blame game on each other
isn't under these circumstance the proposals for increasing electricity and gas tariff a joke with the people?
Why is attention not being given in resolving the issues?
Can the government see the failing of the country's economy?
To counter these problems for the short term, what suggestions do u have?
Please inform us about your opinion.
Imran Khokar from Madina Munawara Saudi Arabia, I want to say the way the people are, they get similar leaders.
I am surprised that government carrying slogan of public service is itself hurting them.
unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a persecution.
Government has no control over the institutions.
Law and order situation is deteriorating every day, may Allah bestow his mercy on this country.

after ruling America for 8 years, president Bush has departed from the White House and shifted to the president camp office in Camp David so that the White House can be renovated according to the new president Barak Obama's likings.
During Bush's eight years rule, the historical attacks and destruction of the World Trade Center, attack on Pentagon and then in the name of war against terror, attacking Afghanistan and Iraq and involving forces from other countries into the war and use of American resources in it have become memorable examples of his time.
due to this war America itself faced the worst ever economical and financial crisis in history.
what do you think the world achieved and lost through this war?
were the policies of Bush successful?
what is your opinion on president Bush's rule?
the Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, in an interview with Jeev News said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour, but due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step? Should sports not be separated from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision not harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that the security condition in India is bad, the England cricket team is continuing its tour, so why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this?
Salman, Karachi
Those people who are proud about going to India
and they make their films and videos over there, their eyes should open now, as to how much the people of India respect you.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami should return to Pakistan first chance he gets because respect did not suit you there either.
Fareed Ahmed

Indian's attitude has changed after Bombay Attacks.
Jagjit Singh has showed his reaction in this way that he hates Pakistan and Pakistani.
One should know that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsley. How is he a bad singer now? Adnan Sami Should stay in India, there is not need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshaad Alam
Karachi, On the statement of Jagjit Singh, I would only say that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Bombay incident, there hateful statements have increased. The same people are now saying evil against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to foreign news agencies, in the farewell trip of American President George Bush, during a press conference with the Prime Minister Nur-al-Maliki, in his office, the situation became hilarious when an Iraqi journalist called Bush saying "Dog, this is a farewell kiss".
After this, the journalist took his shoe off and threw it at Bush. President Bush ducked with expertise and saved himself from getting hit by the shoe.
The second shoe hit the American flag.
Security agents pulled this journalist away from there.
On this occasion, President Bush said that he did not know why he did that, the shoe was of size ten, he was not bothered.
In your opinion, does this action of the journalist show the anger of the Iraqi public against President Bush.
What do you say about this incident?
After the Mumbai terror incidents, the tension in Indo-Pak relations escalated to a grave extent, when Indian Air Force war planes violated Pakistani air space in the Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
Due to the reaction of the Pakistani Air Force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
According to sources, both Indian planes were full of weapons and ammunition.
This is the first of its kind incident in the current tensed situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that Air Force is all set for country's air defense.
Information Minister Sherry Rahman says that Indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed. Although, this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
In your opinion, does India really have an intention of air strike on Pakistan?
Is this statement of India correct that this violation was a mistake or this was to find out the ability of Pakistan Air force.
Is this incident not going to aggravate the current estrangement among the two countries?

Samir

It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she changed totally.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party, and made her son the representative of Peoples Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi, This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
But until the iron ax is not fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are just like this, that they are adopting secretive ways. This is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations have included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed as well as two other Pakistani citizens and that of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organisations into the list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaidah and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, practically non-existent organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba Operation Chief, Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organisations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organisations, they will be restricted from traveling and will be under arrest.
They will have to face cases.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India accusing these organizations for being responsible for the Mumbai Attacks without any proof?
Doesn't India have any local terrorist groups ?
Aren't the world organizations aware of the persecution of minorities in India?
