First Nuclear Test Done in 1990.
Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer, had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.
In this book called 'Nuclear Express,' the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.
Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Thomas Reid said that due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Among the factors are the design of the bomb and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.
He further added that that was the reason that Pakistan was able to reply to India's Nuclear test with a nuclear test, in just 2 weeks and 3 days.
Thomas Reid reminded us that in 1961, Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test. In response, America took 17 days to preform a test, despite having this bomb for a long time.
He added that the atomic bomb, which was tested on May 19th, 1998, by Pakistan, was engineered very carefully and that Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.
When Thomas Reid was asked whether China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he merely mentioned that India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.
He said that there was proof that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and that the documents received from Libya will verify this fact.
Upon further questioning as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.
He said that it was believed that Israel also has access to the results of this testing.
Thomas Reid was also asked about China's current nuclear distribution program.
Thomas Reid answered that China has been providing raw material, guidance, and design for the nuclear setup in Asfahan, Iran, since 1991.
Apart from this, China also provided Iran with the nuclear enrichment plant in Kheraj.
He said that China has been providing Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, and Libya with nuclear technology through North Korea.

Bitterness Between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Israeli president, almost screaming, that the blood of many humans was spilled in Gaza, and it saddened him to see that people could watch this armed killing from Israel and clap in agreement.
Mr. Erdogan said that, "I believe that you are using such words to erase your guilty feelings. But you killed those people, and I am remembering those children who were killed near the shore."
Simon said that Gaza's calamity is not Israel's fault, but that of Hamas, which has established a dangerous dictatorship over there.
A BBC journalist from Davos said that he had never seen such a scene in a global economic forum before.
However, Erdogan later stated that he respected the Israeli president and his age, which is why he did not scream at him, but that still whatever he was saying was very far from the truth.
Turkey is one of the few Muslim countries which has diplomatic relationship with Israel. But displeasure has been materializing between the two recently.
'The attack was not planned by Pakistan'
When talking to ND TV, an Indian channel, Wajid Shamsul Hassan stated that the Pakistani investigation report on the Mumbai attacks would be executed.
In the attack on Mumbai last November, more than 120 people were killed.
India accused the extremist outfit Lashkar e Twaiba of being behind the attack.
India also said that the "political factors" in Pakistan also influenced the incident.
The Mumbai attack has badly affected the relationship between the two countries.
When talking about the Pakistan investigation report on the incident, High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hassan has given out a hint about the whereabouts of the report.
Wajid Shamsul Hassan said that in the light of investigation so far, it is understood that Pakistani land had not been used for organizing the attack.
It might have been some other land; definitely, not Britain too.
These are the two places (Pakistan and Britain) about which I was worried.
India and the international community have put a lot of pressure on Pakistan to take actions against the culprits who carried out the Mumbai attacks.
Wajid Shamsul Haq said: "We are not trying to cover it up."
We believe in taking action based on facts.
The world will accept our investigations.
We will try to satisfy India as to the results (of the investigation).
While defending the delay in the investigation in Pakistan, he said that it takes time to collect, understand, and check these kind of things.
The High Commissioner, Wajid Shamsul Haq, said that it took 45 days for India to present its dossier.

He rose to fame in 2006, when he ran for a Senate seat.

There are reports of the presence of militants in the Ponch province of Jammu.
According to government sources, upon receiving secret reports, the police and the army have surrounded the region and have begun searching.
During this, a fight started in which four militants, two soldiers and one policeman were killed.

During this, chief minister Omer Abdullah, nominated by the involved officials, met with the governor.  He directly gave the news of the Assembly leader's election from his party national conference.
Congress, the ally of the National Conference, also informed the governor of their advocacy of Omar Abdullah.
Omar Abdullah will take oath as the chief minister of the state.
Remember, the National Conference became the biggest party by gaining 28 seats in the 87 member assembly in the current state elections. Keep in mind that separatist parties boycotted the elections.
Congress, which secured 17 seats, accepted to form a coalition government with the National Conference.
Today, party workers welcomed Omar Abdullah with great fanfare on his arrival in Srinagar.
On this occasion, Omar Abdullah says that he will play his role in making the talks possible between the Indian government and separatists. However, this will not be possible until the elections in India and formation of the new government.
Role of EU for Peace in the Middle East.
From the official point of view, the role of the European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
According to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
European Union's spokesman Amadeu Altafaj has said that every such effort is admirable which is helpful in sending the European Union's message to the opponents of the war.
It seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned.
But in reality the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
As the head of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is even weaker than before.
And on top of that the internal issues have made it helpless.
On the other hand, the French president Sarkozy is behaving as if he is still the president of the European Union.
Whereas France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it.
Ambassador of France ,Mr. Bernard Kouchner is in a most comical situation.
He is receiving guidance from the Ambassador of the Czech Republic Mr. Schwarzenberg, who is also involved in the matter.
Not only do their opinions differ, they also might have to face a battle with the western world.
They announced that for the defense of Israel they might have to face the war, even though there doesn't appear to be any need for this. Germany also posted a person towards the East's defense. Until the European Union come to an agreement, they won't win the battle.
This is the proof of Israel, which is doesn't provide any response to the European Countries.
This is best time for the European Union to perform, because America has failed on the western side by the law of Goerge W. Bush.
Capitalism Revolution: Death of the German Millionaire
In Southern Germany, in a place named Subia, Adolf Miracle abandoned his business associates.
Before he left, the German public had never even heard of him.

The aim of advertising is always to sell the product or let the people know the various facilities made available to them; either at the market or at their doorstep.
When a product is being advertised we are able to gather more information such as it's name, price, benefits, and availability in short. It is a brief actual account of itself.
But sometimes the drafted messages tend to be too fictional, owing to either exaggeration or to false claims made by the advertiser. Viewed objectively; the advertising message must act as a salesperson and do it's best to convinced consumer of the merits of the product.
The words used in advertisements are typical of a salesperson's language and this is how he would like to convince his prospective buyer; should they come face to face.
The name of this advertisement is Ratiopharm. The words used by the salesperson definitely praise the product or service that is available.
More often they are colorful and catchy words as they persuade the customer to respond favorably and persuade him to purchase the product. Unless cosmetics and other like Kassbohrer products are heavily promoted, they will languish unsold on the shelves of this stores for a long time.
So advertising always puts forward the best points of the product. Advertisement can be educative, entertaining, informative handy and surely interesting.
At times, however, they tend to be boring, irritating, and incredibly embarrassing.
Another category of advertisements tends to brag so as to tempt the buyers.
But whatever it is; advertisements have a two-fold purpose to serve. They have a message to convey and they attempt to evoke a desirable response in the buyer. As a result 400 VEM products becomes popular ones; the demand increases.
This way, the Merchlay group will stay as it has always been, even after the death of Adolph Merchley.
The rate of crime among immigrants in Germany.
According to latest statistics the average rate of crime among immigrants from 2004 to 2007 is 22%.
Decline from 9 to 0.21%
has reached 4%
According to Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann of the province of Bavaria this change is positive, but superficial.
He said "It should be noted that that the number of outsiders seeking immigration to Germany is increasing."
Hence, it should also be stated in statistics that the criminal is a German citizen but his background is non-immigrant.
He said that his province will also consider this while collecting statistics.
A part from Bavaria the same is being planned in Hamburg.
Senator for foreign affairs from CDU, Christoph Ahlhaus has said, "When research is done in a scientific manner, the man can not pre-decide its results but it is based on the facts and figures that come out as a result of the research".
Ahlhaus diverted the attention to a research report from the anti crime's provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamberg, it was investigated that out of all crimes happening there what percentage have the involvement of foreigners.
Those results showed that the foreigners here have
The crime rate there was less then compared to the crime rates allover the province.
In contrast when in 2006 a survey was done on crimes by youth in Berlin, it came up that young people having foreign background had a percentage of .44
was 7 percent
However, other political parties of Germany like for example, the SPD, the Environmentalists organization Greens, and the leftist organization Linkspartei were against this proposal. While collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired that which German citizen has a foreign background.

Al-Qaida's video message to Germany
In this thirty minute video a man wearing a black turban, covering his face, and holding a gun in his hand addresses the German government.
The same man introduced himself as the Father of Talha and was talking in German.
Arabic subtitles are also present in this video message.
There is a log of Al-Qaeda on the side of the screen and video has the date of October 2008.
In this message, it is told to the German Government that their country is expressing belief that they will not be attacked on after assigning army in a great number in Afghanistan. If this is not innocence, What is it?
This man calling himself ""Father of Talha"" was not threatened about the indirect attack on Germany.
In Afghanistan, the number of German army soldiers included in the United army NATO, is almost 3500 at this time.
In October last year, German Parliament has approved of sending 1000 more soldiers to Afghanistan.
This is the first message received by Germany from Al-Qaeda.
Mikhael Luders, who keeps a close watch on the activities related to terrorism, says in relation to this message, quote:"" The suicide bombing outside German consulate recently has proved that we should take it seriously in every sense.""
For the last few years, AL-Qaeda has been distributing messages over the internet and there have been attacks after such messages.
The militant group called the Taliban took responsibility for the terrorist attack outside the German Embassy over the weekend.
Most German papers and analyzers are linking this attack with Al Qaeda.
"They are targeting Germany."
Muslim hard liners see Germany's Afghan policy in a negative and questionable light.
They blame the German government for adopting biased policies not just toward Afghanistan but the Middle East also.
It is for this reason that they are increasingly finding that Germany is their enemy.
On top of this the German Government stated that even before the video came out publicly the German undercover agencies knew about it.
The German federal anti-crime organization was occupied in investigating the contents of the video.
Obama has taken office as the President of America.
In this crisis the American people are on one side while the rest of the world is expecting different things from Obama.
As Barack Obama receives congratulations from all over the world on becoming the president of America, the expectations for him are also rising.
In reference to this, the German Chancellor Angela Merckle has expressed confidence in the American president.
"I am sure that based on the friendship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America, we can resolve all the issues faced."
Russian prime minister Viladimir Putin has said that Obama appears to be a serious and open-hearted man, and that this is really good news.
Though the policies of former American president George W. Bush have been facing criticism.
His regime is credited with promoting China into a more constructive role internationally, but China has said that the new American president will have to work for stronger military relations between both countries.
Active in the German city of Bochum, Chinese political expert Kusuay Wu says:
"in reference to this, I am sure that in the coming weeks and months Obama and his team of economists will put immense pressure on China to have a more flexible and competitive market exchange rate for the Chinese currency."
The former American regime also improved relations with India.
As to how far Obama can take these relations, Christopher Raj, Professor of American Studies in New Delhi, says this: "now we have come closer in strategic partnership, however, Obama can not bring an overnight change."
In a message sent to Obama by Pope Benedict, the Pontiff also stressed the need to create an environment of peace and mutual help in the world.
State Elections in Israel
This is the first election of any importance in this war-torn country since 2005.
For the state elections, more than 14,400 contestants are in the running for 440 seats.
To maintain peace and safety during the elections, 800,000 police and soldiers were posted in Iraq.
Fearing that some bomb blast or terrorist attack might take place on this important day, all the borders of Iraq were sealed one day in advance, i.e. on Friday.
The airport was closed and restrictions were placed on public transport as well.
According to reports, due to the restrictions on public transport, there was no traffic on the roads of Baghdad, and children were seen playing football on the roads.
During the present Iraqi elections, the security arrangements will determine whether or not the local security agencies will be able to take over the country after the return of the American forces from Iraq in 2011, and also, political analysts are using this as a test as to what extent the public is prepared to bring change to the country in democratic ways.
The state elections are being held with help from the United Nations and almost 800 international supervisors are overlooking the elections.

The martyrs include 275 innocent children. They embraced death smiling at the faces of deceitful Arab leaders and the organizations pretending to be working for international human rights.
The Israeli troops were forced to leave Ujain in Gaza today because of the strong resistance of the masked Palestinian soldiers. They exhibited magnificent defense with the help of their strong faith and desire for sacrifice. They engage in a do or die battle against the Zionist enemies.
But for the treacherous stand of the Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, the brave and solid fighters of Hamas would have thrown the Israeli troops into the pit of shameful defeat. Unfortunately, the Egyptian Muslims also keep the Palestinians under siege along with the Israeli troops. It is the most tragic incident in the history of Arabia.
It can be seen that Saudi Arabia and the Udar government extend political as well as financial assistance to Israel. Similarly, they join hands with Israel to deceive the Musalmans of Gaza who endure unending miseries.
Barak Obama and America weave new evil strategies against Iran.

President Bush said he did everything for the protection of America.
In response to several questions asked about Israeli aggression in Gaza, President Bush replied that Israel has the right to protect herself but Hamas does not. Hamas should not attack Israel, and like America, the whole world should strangle the oppressed instead of the oppressor.
America's most incompetent and ineligible president said that Hamas should not be provided arms. However, America is giving the most devastating weapons to Israel, who are using these weapons in the genocide of Palestinians. Also criticized pro Israeli Arabs and declared them friends of Israel.
Bush was embarrassed by the crimes committed in Abu Garib and Guantanamo Bay.
Experts say that Bush should be trialled for war crimes because it would greatly benefit mankind.

President Ahmede Nejad has said in his message: "You know that for the last 19 days Israel has been bent upon human genocide, murdering innocent children, and subjecting homes, mosques, schools and hospitals to barbaric bombing. The Zonist Regime is brutally murdering the unarmed Muslims in Gaza. In situations like these, silence on the part of leaders like you is only encouraging Israel."
President Ahmede Nejad has told Malik Abdullah that even non-Muslim countries like Valenzuela and Bolivia have taken concrete steps against Israel and that he is expected to take better steps.
President Ahmede Nejad told the Palestinians that success will be at their feet in Gaza.
He says that the oppressed will win over the oppressors because that's Allah's promise.
President George Bush: Terrorism is Still a Threat to USA
MEHER/MAHAR news agency has copied from the German news agency that the US President, while addressing his successor Barak Obama and the nation in his farewell speech, said that though the US is safer than it was seven years ago, the threat of terrorism still looms over USA.
Bush said that the enemy terrorists are waiting patiently to attack America, and they have a strong determination to attack America so America should never be unaware about its security.
The American President ignored the hurts and suffering of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, and defended his policies saying that America is still the biggest supporter of independence. However, commentators do not accept the reality of the unpopular president's remarks, as America is neither a supporter of freedom, nor a supporter of human rights, but rather it is the most mischievous country in the world, which not only supports a blood thirsty country like Israel, but is also directly involved in its crimes.
Israel openly kills children, women and civilians and the American president is congratulating them. This is the American humanity and freedom which the world is seeing in Gaza and other places.
Usama Hamdan: Presence of army in Palestine continues
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, the Hamas leader in Lebanon, Usamah Hamdan told French News Agency during an interview that the one-sided ceasefire from Israel's side is against the comprehensive international efforts for a ceasefire. He said that as long as Israel is present in Gaza, a one-sided ceasefire is meaningless.
He said that the one-sided ceasefire was an unsuccessful effort of Israel to escape defeat. Hamdan said that if Israel wants long term peace, it will have to accept Hamas's conditions as well as end this siege.
The Hamas leader in Lebanon made it clear that if Israel tries a one-sided ceasefire with its army remaining in the Gaza belt, there will be resistance against it.
Addressing a one way conference from Beirut, the Usamah Hamdan called for the European countries to break ties with Israel.
The Hamas leader said that the increasing numbers of the martyred and injured will only increase our determination.
He told the Palestinian public to stay firmly rooted and resist the enemy like a boulder.

Apart from this, the White House is expected to revise suspected terrorism investigation methods and ban ill treatment of prisoners during interrogation.
President Barack Obama started to fulfill his election campaign promises from his first day in office, while taking steps towards making the actiona of the government transparent.
Experts say that the American president has started making efforts to save the falling image of America, but that will be difficult as long as America keeps supporting the blood thirsty Israeli government. Therefore if America wants to save its image, it will have to stop its support of Israel and disassociate itself from Israel's crimes.

Tea may help prevent breast cancer
According to new research, drinking three cups of tea every day
the risk for breast cancer is reduced by more than one third  in women under 50 years old.
Research conducted by the MOFT center in Florida, USA, has found that women under 50 years age that have breast cancer genes
The risk of breast cancer is reduced by 37 percent in women who drink three cups of tea per day.
The research shows that women over 50 years of age do not see any benefit from drinking three or more cups of tea a day.
The researchers think that for women under 50, the tea contains elements that are effective against the genes that cause breast cancer.
In the Moffitt Cancer Center, in Tampa, Florida, research was conducted on over 5000 women who had undergone treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 74.
Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles with women who were had not developed breast cancer.
The experts found that the drinking of tea showed a definite relationship to a specific form of cancer called lobular cancer, decreasing its occurrence by 66 percent.
Ten percent of breast cancer patients suffer from this form of cancer.
This form of cancer is particularly dangerous because it is deep and is not usually discovered until it has spread significantly.
Experts say that regular tea consumption, at least three cups a day, can drastically reduce the occurrence of breast cancer in young women.
They add that having tea on a daily basis is an excellent defense against this cancer.
In Britain, approximately 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year.

Why reduction in exercise with increase in the age
New Research
Exercise is good for health in every age
Exercize keeps the heart healthy,reduces the level of cholesterol, helps in keeping the weight low, helps in reduction of blood sugar, and decreases the progress of dementia.
Unfortunately, as many people age, their capability exercise also decreases.
Medical specialists say that with exercise, our body and brain remain active, but age can have an effect.
The American Medical Association says that many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out.
Doctor Patricia Pellikka of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says that the reason for the increase in age is due to lack of exercise and less bodily functionality.
Dr. Pellikka teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.
She did research on heart illnesses in the elderly and on the benefits of exercise.
A team of doctors used high frequency layers of sound to test the functioning of the heart.
in which they studied the work the heart, the compressing, and the resting of the heart.
The experts had given full attention on the left side of the heart which is the important part where the blood is pumped.
They deduced that with age, stress is laid upon the respiration  of the heart.
Dr. Pellikka says that as one ages, the heart's respiration is stressed, and and that with the effect is magnified by exercise.
Doctor Garven Ken was included in this study.
They say that we were surprised to see that this thing is effected necessarily and with this it has been clear that bad exercise functionality has an affect on the heart's respiration work.
Blood Pressure can cause cardiovascular disease and dysfunction.
If doctor and patient cooperate with each other, then exercise can be beneficial, even in old age.
A detailed report has been published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
There is no chance of war with Pakistan in the near future, said the Indian army chief.
The Indian Army chief, Gen. Depak Kapoor, said that there is very little chance of war with Pakistan. "However, we are ready to protect our national interests at any cost," he said.
General Kapoor says that despite international pressure terrorist networks still exists and are active on Pakistani soil.
He was talking with journalists in Sri Nagar.
The Indian Army chief is on a one day visit to Kashmir Valley to observe the activities of armed forces on the border.
When he was asked to comment about the Pakistan's rejection of Indian proofs about Mumbai Attacks, Gen. Kapoor said that political leadership is responsible to deal with issues relevant to peace or war.
When he was asked to comment about the Pakistan's rejection of Indian proofs about Mumbai Attacks, Gen. Kapoor said that political leadership is responsible to deal with issues relevant to peace or war.
The organization of riots and protests is quite common in the streets of Pakistan. It is also reported that there would be a tremendous battle between India and Pakistan. Pakistan has aimed to weaken the Indian Army.
It is also reported that there are about 700-800 militants within Kashmir, of which about 50% are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor has reported that there is some improvement in the K.I.K. atmosphere. He has also said that Pakistan has increased their military efforts in the Pakistan-dependent region of Kashmir. They have also strengthened their army camps at the borders.
He has also reported that he has increased the number of soldiers in the India-dependent Kashmir region. He has clearly mentioned that from the current status of the conflict, there cannot be any compromise with regards to national security.
Oh God, please accept our prayers. Please prove Barack Obama to be good for this world.
It is evident from the present situation that there are very miniscule chances of getting a positive response. But still we will wait and see to what extent the Pakistan-American Relationship changes and what benefit it can give to us.
What inspiration does Obama give to this world with regard to Martin Luther king's dreams and ambitions?
Obama (whose middle name is Hussain) is going to take the Presidential Oaths. He is going to be a protector of his country and its history. This will be a test of American history.
Not only for the sake of their community, but also for all of those who have supported him with their heart and soul.
This test will happen on the extreme white paper.it is not easy for him to write on the blue paper whole-heartedly that he would rule the country with justice.
Here, South Asia, specially Muslims who have expectations from them, should remember that he has been elected as the president of America. And Obama should remember that President of America is actually the President of the entire world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves, and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era. Today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have to have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, so this will be a win for people who love him.
What will be its effect on South Asia, and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan?

Dear, whether it is Obama or some one else, the decision of the policy of the entire world is done by Jews lobby of  billionaires, influencing, powerful and effective people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts,the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is in front of everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat, who had a regular Army and law.
He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a  pact.
However, it is matter of sorrow that our government treated Swat like a step-mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the termination of the government of the ruler of Swat.
There was no interest was taken in building and development works.
The girls who are getting education today are much less in number than  those who used to get educated in the previous era.
In the Frontier Province, there is a continuous targeting of educational institutions by the Taliban.
The maximum number of schools have been destroyed in district Swat in which majority are the girls schools.
In addition to this, the Taliban has imposed a ban on girls' education.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.
What do you think are the objectives of the Taliban to end females' education?
Why is the government unable to stop these unlawful acts?
What do you think the government should do?
The question is, what are the benefits for ISI and Pakistani agencies?
Now the people in S.W.A.T. can understand that the military is there to support the Taliban, not to kill them.  How is it possible that in Karfuo five schools were blown up and people were slaughter and hanged at the road?
When there is no government authority left, how can the government stop these unlawful acts?
Next the question arises that with all the advance technology, destructive weapons, and an effective spy system, why is the Taliban still not in control?
The answer is because there is a handle on their secret power.  That is why their weapons never end and they are never arrested.
The conclusion is that the Taliban, with their deeds, are making the work easier for world control.
The war in Afghanistan is going on for the past 15 years.
ISI is controlling the Taliban when at that time its opponent was the North coalition, supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly the situation changed, and the actions of the Taliban began to appear.
And ISI was also offered American dollars, so past friends became enemies.
Now the situation is that this war continues, but still helping in Pakistan are Iran, India and Russia.
Unless the feeling of what is right and wrong does not emerge in humans, then humans will keep making mistakes.
As an example, when a thief when goes to steal, if he at that time gets a thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse, there is also punishment in it and he fears from God, then that person will not steal.
Likewise, unless Israel gets this apprehension that i am doing wrong and draining blood of innocents and I will get punishment for this, he will keep playing holy with the blood innocents of Gaza until then.
Respect!
The question is whether war and terrorism are solutions to the problem?
If not, then what is the specific prescription which will solve the problem?
It is right that the war is the way that does not solve the problem but make it more difficult.
Falastin, Afghanistan and Iraq should learn from the efforts of Nelson Mandela in South Africa to make their movements success.
That mean there should be behavior and political efforts in more then force.
The participating of Kashmirian public in election tells that they accepted this view.
The third week of continued Israeli attacks on Ghaza left thousands dead.
The war could not be stopped until this time with world ambassador efforts.
And according to a guess 9000 Falatinis have been left their homes and gone to save places after the attacks  starting in December.
And here helpful institutions blamed Israel that he did not care the Falastini children and there will be one total posterity in hard mental and emotional problems.
What do you say?

How could a long term peace be possible in Gaza?

Give a chance to the Taliban.
Basit, Peshawar.
Wake up.  If the Taliban will do real Jihad, they will sacrifice innocent people.
Who burnt out Girls School?
And if someone is kidnapped for ransom and the ransom isn't received, who will hang people on the pole by calling them American spies?
Those Taliban do a lot of damage to Islam that no other nation or religion has done.

Kohat, Pakistan
If the Muslim world were to threaten or even actually attack Israel, there would be consequences from America, Israel's long-term world partner.
We would see a spectacular response.
What should be done about the cowardice of Muslim rulers?
As Ahmadi Nejad is famous for his bravery, he should be first in line to attack.
The struggle for peace and human rights is not the sole responsibility of Arabs or the Muslim world. It is the duty of the whole world to raise their voices against cruelty.
This sad incident was the worst crime committed by Bush.
In India and Pakistan, the financial corruption increases at the end of fiscal year. Similarly, the Bush administration has permitted Israel to do what it wants.
On one hand, America demands a seize fire.
On the other hand, the United Nations is passing resolution after resolution, but have taken no concrete actions. This can mean only one thing: that even the United Nations is openly in favor of destroying Muslims.
All Muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the United Nations and should establish their own global organisation.
We have many examples of where promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations lead only to harm of Muslims.
What is the use of these vain efforts if the BBC does not want to publish anything?
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically of Muslims, is spilled, the monster of unbiasedness gets onto BBC's back.
which considers itself the standard bearer of truth. (Correct, but not a complete sentence)
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments.
from Muslims (Correct, but not a complete sentence)
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, while you stay among Muslims, call yourselves Muslims and cause Muslims..
[syja786]
For a long time it was said on BBC forums that sometimes suicide bombing and other kinds of terrorism in India was used to target a certain sect.
The favorite word for these Anti-Islamic discussions was Extremism.
You can get a very good idea about who an extremist is from the above discussion in which writing against Iran was almost considered blasphemy.
When will our Muslims understand that the Anti Christ can not be fought with swords?
Looking at unarmed people being killed in the bombing of Israel, what shall one do other than cry?
But the basic fault is of this turmoil is that, by naming Jihad, we try to blacken the beautiful face of Islam.
When the majority of Palestinians had already accepted the existence of Israel, then why did Hammas need to fire those rockets on Israel and make suicide attacks?
The attitude of the both the sides is against humanity.
The role of the UN and the USA was again seen as favoring the injustice of Israel.
May Allah give the Muslim nation the understanding of how to become united. Ameen!
As a matter of fact, think about giving Noble Prize to terrorists. In carrying out this painful terrorist activity, the actual work is being done by them. It is s a campaign against terrorism.
Otherwise, is it possible to carryout terrorist activity on such a massive scale without the assistance of Chiefs and  every one knows who are pulling their strings.
In such a situation it can be termed as high handedness "Do what ever you can".
The strong mans fist, it beats over the head and do not let one cry.
The Arab rulers are giving out medicine for the injured, Funeral clothing's for the dead and money. They are asking
Should the Israelis continue attacks?
The actual problem is that the rulers of Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia are dreaming, undutiful, and unaware. They have neither the army nor defense plans. They just think that by providing aid they have fulfilled their duty.
They should immediately take practical steps against Israel.
like cutting off oil supply to European countries and America, but they feel sorry for them.
Regards to all brothers and sisters.
I think asking Hamas to give up their struggle for the sake of peace is unfair to millions of widows and orphans. It negates their struggle entirely.
If the  Pharaoh-ism of US and Israel is on the rise then Moses will come to counter them because every Pharaoh has a Moses.  The American and Israeli actions are producing suicide bombers among Muslims.
Power has affected their ability to think and understand.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Now Hamas and Israel should cease fire to stop bloodshed.
Mohammad Sarfraz, Paris, France
Rightly said.
Suppose Hamas is on the right path and struggling against cruelty for the sake of God's will, they should know that an act of goodness does not remain good if it causes harm to others.
Love for humanity is the precondition for God and his prophet's love.
It would seem God has said to annihilate all people other than Muslims.
Najeeb-ur-Rahman Psycho *Lahore* [Pakian]
No! It is not decreed to annihilate, but it is decreed to invite people to Islam.
But for people who conspire against the religion, it is decreed to do Jihad against them.
One should fight with them until they finish their conspiracies. But this certainly does not mean that they are given permission to wear a jacket that hides bombs and blow up a crowd.
Brothers, a murderer of children faces dire consequences.
But I say to my friends that yesterday Israelis did not have a roof over their heads and today they are so strong that they do not listen to anyone because all Jews are one.
They do not have Shiite nor Sunni, all are just Jews, and so they have succeeded in every field.
Contrary to this, what is the condition of 55 Islamic Countries?
They are lagging in every field, and now the condition is such that they are so helpless that enemies are killing them and they are waiting for their death.
The point is that all Muslim countries should get together and should make a plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
There is no better action plan than this - to accept Israel and to learn modern science and developmental ways and allow the world to live in peace and calm.
Muslims have a lot of land and resources.
The need is for proper utilization.
First, the part that hurts the most is that there could not be unity between Hamas and Al-Fath.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were systematically killed to weaken the brave nation of the only region which is still fighting for Masjid Aqsa. This was not possible as long as Yasin and Arafat were in the way.
The world is watching how Palestine is becoming scattered, second by second, after the death of these two leaders.
The Jewish lobby is increasing its reach, second by second.
In 1974, Pakistan had a Prime Minister of such global credentials that for the first time in the history of the country, he gathered all the Muslims leaders, with a 100% attendance, under a single roof.
Today, on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task for the people to pledge to keep unity within their ranks.
Also, while eradicating the differences between other Muslims,  its (The formation of Islamic common wealth) mission will be carried forward
Its a monster that has gripped Palestine for half a century.
This monster has many faces.
Many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
And its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This monster is most unhappy with Islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through Islam, Muslims, the perfect religion of Muslim and Practical Islam as the history tells that Islam has put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
Bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since 27th of December.
More than 300 Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
After the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
Through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has ordered Israel and the Palestinian authorities to cease fire.
However, Israeli officials claim that they will continue their actions in Gaza, until they are convinced that Israel will be safe from rocket attacks.
In your opinion, is the statement by Israel, that this is an Israeli struggle for safety acceptable?
In this situation, is the global brotherhood doing its' job?
Can this inhumane action have a direct relationship with the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can there be any expectation of improvement, in the Middle East, after newly elected president Barack Obama takes office?

Palestine is a holy land for Muslims all over the world, and protecting it is a necessary duty for all of us.

Zaheer Chughtai
In this art now a days; the Pakistani electronic and print media, especially some Urdu newspapers and columnists, are no more behind anyone who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism, or in the ""grudge of Muavia"" written on them.
Has said that the United Nations, which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of it's mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. How long will this hypocrisy continue?
Why is there so much oppresion of the Muslim people? Allah has declared that if countries like America stop supporting the Jews, then they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support and then see what kind of life they get.
The famous people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.
In the words of a poet,
"Oppression is oppression, that the more it's done the more it is erased.
Blood is blood, that the more it falls, the more it gathers."
Now who can tell who did terrorism?
Is all this not included in terrorism? Why does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocent not red?
And why is there no one to send a mourning message from anywhere?
I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.
I can not find the words that are strong enough to condemn the actions that resulted in the dead bodies on the road, and the helpless, injured, and innocent faces soaked in blood.
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims in this situation.  On the one hand, because of the killing in India the rest of the world comes over to Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations that we would normally do on our own.
On the other hand, Israel is killing generations of muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent.  This is unbearable!
There is delay but NEVER in the house of God and only then will this darkness be shed. Then
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Elections are important for securing the people's support, especially in countries like Israel, and rulers should continue to hold them.  However, history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy so Barrack Obama likely won't either.  Regime, whether black or white, is still a regime.
From the debates in the forum it is evident that everyone is sad about Benazir's death, however we can not ignore her political mistakes.
There's room for debate about whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was so dear then why did it take American involvement to end Musharaf's ten year dictatorship?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when those affected by dictatorship needed her. Unfortunately, she came to Pakistan only when she reassured the current government and knew that she would not be accused.
There is no one remaining to say about the criticism and accusations of a historical personality.

Some things should be ignored because nothing can be done about them.

How bloody is our Nation? In our parties excitement in writing the episode, they will be blind. While at the moment every historic person is trying to pinpoint an accusation, criticize the judicious, and no one is tell any thing.
We the people have achieved a lot of success.

Few things can be avoided by thinking that nothing can be done. For this is the same reason why a donkey will not become a professor just by putting books on him.
If after the attack on Mumbai created a problem between Pakistan and India in there regular activities, yet India and Pakistan still have to continue there regular activities.
If we talk about war then at the both ends there will be a loss of human beings.
India is telling us that the person who got arrested at the time of the Mumbai attack is also a Pakistan citizen. They also stated that he wrote a letter in Urdu and sent it to Pakistan. On the other end, India first stated after arresting him that he is a big engineer. Later they proved  that he is just 4th standard Pass, point to be observed.
First of all to Mr. Bhana and all western friends of this forum a happy Christmas.
Colleagues of the forum: Mr. Psycho, A Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahedah Akram and to all Adaab (Salaam, Greeting)
We do not want the flames of war, we want the flowers of peace.
War is in itself a problem.
What problems can war solve?
It will give fire and blood today.
It will give hunger and need tomorrow.
Therefore, O intelligent people,
If war keeps getting postponed, it's better.
On your porch and mine,
If the candle keeps burning, it's better.
Indo-American relations have now gotten quite deep. India knows with certainty that America will openly betray Pakistan when the time comes.
This is also the old history of America.
In case of an Indian attack, America would make its goals and the expense would be on India as well.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that says we will not attack first, but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation and ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied, even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
This is Islamic history.
Even before this resolution, the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it clearer and that is why, in contrast to the initial strict reaction, the world community has relaxed its pressure now.
While ignoring India's unnecessary bobbery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a "Side Effect" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
There are no two opinions over this. It is a heinous act.
But the question is this- when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past year?
How many Taliban are killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday?
I appeal to the I.S.I. that for God's sake, stop monitoring the Taliban and let us live in peace in our heavenly hometown Sawat.
Please stop this unjustified and terrible operation.
The day is not far off when a resolution regarding Pakistan's military intervention will be passed by United Nations just like the resolution passed against Jamat-ud-Dawah.

The extremists of our country and their supporters are constantly providing all the evidence and justification required for the instigation of action against them.  God forbid that the day when such a resolution is passed, in all likelihood not a single voice will be raised in the United Nations in our favor.
Supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.
We are not aware of or familiar with the activities or intentions of Pir Sami-ullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
Like the deadbodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, Doctor Najeebullah and thousands of other revolutionists have been subjected to dishonour at the hands of the enemy.
Even when they die, they are still immortal.
But there is an international game being played here in which place public is ruled by frightening barbarism and ferociousness.
If we are not here then these ferocious barbarians will feel they have the license to take over the government.
These acts of so-called Islamic activists in the name of religion should be utterly condemned.
Extremist supporters can see the injustice of America's actions, but instead of expressing grief about those dishonest acts these supporters completely ignore them by giving them the name of tribal traditions.
By cloaking himself in tribal traditions, sometimes in the name of Islam, a pious man cannot give reason for such dishonest acts.
In my view, our Army people are associated with these people.
As such, when these people move from one place it takes long enough that they can be caught, but it's a stretch.  It's hard for the Army to get there before these people are long gone.
They mercilessly kidnap 50-70 men while our Army sits comfortably, watching them like spectators.
They are servants of Allah and so is the Army.
All this shows that there is something wrong at the bottom.
Malaiat. In the period of The dictator of the time Zia-u-Lhaq he did not show good characteristics of sympathies of Allah. However, there are various tortures  that occur in the name of religion. Some refer to "What will be done after death".
Such persons use this as a way to get respect from the world.
O Speakers                                                                                                                                                              ""preachers""
You frighten the world with the fires of Hell.
Then you became the image of fright.
It is wondered then where it is said that this cannot be a Muslim action.
We ourselves do not know this history or cover it for any purpose.


Was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina act of Christians and Jews?
Without accepting reality, neither can their motives be understood nor can corrections be made.
BBC please stop this dual-sided policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
Please show some respect. A human was pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic at the box office?
The success of operation Sherdil and Operation Lion Heart, depends on who is better in the eyes of the general public.
This act is by American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahab is a victim of this conspiracy.
All discussions on this forum will now be anti-Taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined Taliban and they are doing what they can to change the public opinion.
I would just like to ask one question. What were the soldiers doing when the body was left hanging there all day? Were they aiming only for the common folk? It is said that when Taliban hideouts were bombed, a woman and two kids were killed when a house was attacked.
Why? Didn't they know about this tragedy?
Were they goofing off, or not?
Let me make a request to you. For God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler who watches over all of us.
The question raised by the BBC is substandard; I could only feel pity for the writers. For instance, nobody asked this: What were the 3000 soldiers camping at Swat doing?
The army's assistants were hanging the bodies of those who resisted the Taliban on poles.
The crimes committed against the commoners by the Pakistani soldiers have been done. But it is not right that the media, including the BBC, has concealed that fact from the world.
The Pakistani soldiers are playing it up for drama.
Every child in Swat whispers that it is all just a farce.
Stop this drama for God's sake!
These Talibans have destroyed the image of Muslims.
If the real Muslims don't accept Taliban as Muslims, then why would they get a refuge in their places.
The ones who are shameless and don't do hardwork and labour, take arms in their hands and join their group.
Islam doesn't spread through sword and guns.
Have shame.
It's baseless and has no roots in any religion, nor in family customs.
All media, including BBC, show different views on Taliban and Tribals.
In fact, nobody knows the actual situation except us, because we are the natives.
(  sorry was pretty hard to translate)
This move has ashamed all Muslims.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is the Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq, a man who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that the current leadership will end this  cancer.
After the Mumbai attacks, India said that extremists are behind the attacks.
Pakistan rejected the accusations and said that it will help India in investigating the attacks in every possible way.
India said that it has given a list to Pakistan that has 20 suspected extremists being sought by India.
Now Pakistan has said that included in the list is Jaish-e-Muhammad's Molana Azhar Masood, who is not in custody and the government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before that, Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari refuted the view that the West's secret agencies and the Indian government had given evidence related to the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari has said that it has not been proven that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani.
At that time, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that relations with India would not improve as long as its land was being used to harbor terrorists.
And, in the most recent development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled its tour of Pakistan.
Should sports be affected by political events?
What future do you see for the relationship between India and Pakistan?
Neither America Nor India Will Cause Downfall of Pakistan
Pakistanis May Destroy Their Own Country
What do you expect after such hostile displays of nationalism, regionalism and vandalism.
Jinnah himself did not really succeed in aiding the Muslims of India, as time has proven.
Yasmin, Chicago
But if we had kept on following the vision of Jinnah, the cancers of nationalism, regionalism and vandalism would not have spread in Pakistan and the Muslims of India would not have been treated this way
Our mistake is not producing a leader of his caliber
We should pay due respect to our heroes.
This region has great potential.
God knows when this region will learn its lesson and unity of the people will bring regional development and prosperity.
Both countries have extremist forces such as the Taliban, Shiv Sina and the RSS, etc. These extremist forces are enemies of the regional peace.
The imperial powers do not want peace and stability in this region. They control these countries like puppet masters.
Can you imagine the international influence of Pakistan, China and India, if they were united?
Pakistan is under the occupation of corrupt and opportunist leaders.
May God protect our country, Pakistan.
But being Pakistanians we should not neglect the realities on the ground. American forces have been deployed very near to our border with Afghanistan.
Besides, the situation in the country doesnt seem to be stable (like in the NWFP, Baluchistan and Sindh) and the problems in Karachi are also evident.
In this atmosphere we need a leader capable of uniting the people of this country.
Oh God, please show us some mercy!
I believe we must go to war one last time. That is our only option.
Enough is enough!
It's now or never!
These fraudulent dialogues and pointless meetings are not the solution to the problems!
Neither is committing small scale terrorist acts against each other's territories!
After all, it was only after entering World War II that Europe found a way to sort out its problems.
And if it wasn't for this World War, the nations involved would still be arguing and nagging each other over small things.
Almost all of our political parties are unified to the topic that terrorism and sectarian violence, shall be eradicated from the country.
But our own military leadership does not seem to be sincere on this topic. At one side, Europe and America are assured that the military is sincere in achieving a terror free state. But, on the other hand, they help the Taliban in disguise.
Now we have to think and define our path and select one path to focus on, Thank you.
There is no doubt that the elements of Jamat-ud-dawa include majority of those people who belong to Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is a banned organization, is now established and operating with a new name Jamat-ud-dawa Pakistan.
However, after that, more focus was diverted towards humanitarian activities and now on India's strong request.  The United Nations has also banned it and the government of Pakistan has also implemented a crack down on this organization.
In my opinion if these Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and get focused towards religion and humanitarian assistance, then it is much better.
The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan which have used the name of Jihad to induct and nurture professional killers, criminals and their molana's, are the same people who called Pakistan 'Plaeedistan' meaning un clean land. These are the people who make a bad name for Pakistan.
Now, they are trying their best to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they don't even get close to being called a Muslim.  In fact, they deserve to be called animals or barbarians
Pakistan security will stay at risk until these extremists are eradicated from Pakistan.
Should we still  think that the innocent people will be charged with rules and regulation?
In this angry world in which we live, war is a job, and the only work is killing.
This news breaks my heart.
What kind of world are we living in where it is too difficult to follow and live with the preachings of Allah's Islam?
Non muslim can kill muslim but when the muslim try to take revenge then all non muslim  with the whole world brother's  together think ,that the islamic preaching's are done with Hafiz Sayeed.
The attack on Mumbai left India very upset.
Pakistanis created the misunderstanding between the two countries, and in the upcoming future, the situation will only get worse.
India always blames Pakistan's terror group.
The up coming problems on the taluk ,has  been stoped.
Indian Security Centers blamed Lashkar-e-tayab for the attack on Mumbai.
In this case, the name Jamat-ud-Dawa has popped up many times.
This is the first time that relations between both countries have worsened due to a terrorist activity in India.
In December 2001, after attacks on Indian Parliament, these two neighbors were on the brink of war.
Afterwards, in 2002 Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and added to their terrorists list.
Now Security analysts say Jamat-ud-Dawais is, in reality, the new face of Lashker-e-Tayyaba. Restrictions on the party are being requested.
In your opinion, should this party be banned or not?
Should Pakistan carry out decisive operations against extreme activists on its own land?
Can banning Jamat-ud-Dawa cause the current Pak-India crisis to end?
Will it cause the crisis to be over? How important is it to close down the armed groups to keep peace between both countries?
The Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. Yet what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly?
Will the Peace Council ever show any alertness against the Muslims?
When the accuser is lazy the witness is active.
India has become one useless realm.
India is cheating the world by blaming Pakistan over its uselessness, while their own intelligence, army, and other security officials have become useless and become a mole for terrorists.
If one disbeliever dies then the whole world knows about it- why is this double accuracy?
To the dear nation of one nonpolitical, religious, farming organization,
Farqaan Farooq, Faisalabad
Until our Prophet(Peace be upon Him), great ancestors and Sufism gave the human beings the love and respect, the Islamic religion was more vast growing and ripening from peace and sparkle.
The Muslims were promoted in every field.
This beautiful religion rose to the hands of distillation, and within human beings began the difference of religion and disbelief. The new gateways of pride and prejudice began to open by which the world was unknown before.
Salute, sir, salute happily, but get your work done on your own.
Do not do it under the pressure from America.
If India is in difficulty, let them prove it, no?
Why does it not give?
And why do they accuse us with everything?
There are fundamentalist groups and organisations even in India. Why does no one put any restrictions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the whole world?
What is it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What is it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the first Islamic Nuclear State. Why is this what the fight is about?
Pakistan is on the verge of falling apart.
Kamranhassan, ABU DHABI
You are right; circumstances do support your argument.
Now, even American magazines are publishing new maps of Pakistan. These sanctions are part of the greater game plan.
Gradually, the United States is strengthening its grip on Pakistan.
In this situation, if we had not become a united nation, the history of the formation of Bangladesh could have been repeated.
Terrorist attacks should be condemned, whether these are committed in Mumbai, Islamabad, or Philistine.
Terrorists should be uprooted without any discrimination of nationality.
The question arises, why is Pakistan and the rest of world silent on the terror attacks in Pakistan, which killed hundreds of innocent people?
if attack on Marriott was not act of terror?
Then why?
Hale to the adviser for interior Rehman Malik, how brave and bold the gentleman has become.
No image.
Not only this; but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity. That the arresting of the terrorists has been carried out under "someone's pressure".
Wow, praise to the Almighty!
Whether having the ability to say that I don't want to or not.
We, the Pakistanis, are fighting whose war?
We have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect.
No one has a right to interfere with anyone's national affairs.
The colonial system is apparently not there.
If people are sure to have justice or Allies support the importance of free judiciary and give respect to democratic institutes and dont support the dictatorial governments; peace can be achieved in third world countries including Pakistan. But this is not acceptable for allies
Pakistan is always in line with European and American interests.
Pakistan is forced to do so despite a majority of its population opposes it.
This enhances the opposite or anti sentiments.
If America and its Allies believe in Democracy, they should give up their colonial behavior and leave this region
Pakistan has ability to arm or disarm.
Security forces searched a camp of Lashkar-i-tayba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
After Mumbai attacks, pressure is being increased on Pakistan to take actions against extreme outfits
India blames that Lashkar-i-tayba has role in Mumbai Attacks.
Condoleezza Rice, American foreign minister asked Pakistani leadership to take practical and transparent actions against those responsible for Mumbai attacks.
he believed the terrorists involved in Mumbai Attacks used the Pakistani soil.
Meanwhile, the officials in Peshawar has told that more than 50 trucks have been burnt by some unknown armed persons. These trucks were going to Afghanistan with goods for NATO forces.
These was the second attack on American supply in the last 48 hours.
Meanwhile Pakistani police cracked down a camp of Lashkar i Taiba, a banned outfit. Already many efforts have been made to disarmed the extremists, even money and indemnity was offered.
It is clear from the circumstances that efforts remain unsuccessful to dislodge the armed groups funded by Americans and Saudis during afghan war. It means efforts to restore Pre-80's Pakistan are fruitless.
Question arises, whether Pakistan wants to do so?
If Pakistan has an ability to do this?
What is your opinion?

I have only one question for the standard bearers of the world.
If you kill their children, will they come to garland you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill innocent public, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in negative, then you really need to fix your viewpoint.
The people were armed when there was the fear that Russia would head towards Pakistan after finishing Afghanistan, and that is why they were supplied arms.
Now, when there is the fear that America will capture Pakistan, via Afghanistan, as the president American president has clearly mentioned in his presidential mission, why should we disarm them now?
Only after defeating the American or Indian army, it does not have to face any resistance from the public.
If any of them are guilty of being involved in any destructive work, Pakistan can take action against them alone.
It is sad that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved because this proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty; it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
Another question, were these terrorists not supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan?
The present terrorism is in no way connected to Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Remember, Hafiz Saeed is the first 'Jehadi leader' who called the Taliban actions 'mischief'.
I am sure that the Taliban effect is an inseparable result of American plans. Hence, every person who can stand in the way of the Taliban must be removed.
Despite the support of the whole nation, Zardari and co. took action against the Lashkar. This is a clear sign of their frigid, kiss-up nature.
To stop the project that is running on Saudi-American funding, they must be requested themselves to regather, for God's sake, the filth that has polluted our society.
We will protest against those who distributed dangerous weapons, such as America and Saudi Arabia. The so-called Jihad is actually brought about by them distributing hatred literature and other cultural viruses which have created a human slaughterhouse.
After the threat from India to attack Pakistan, the Pakistan military announces that it will pull its forces from the Afghan border and put them towards India. The Taliban also announced that they will take care of the Afghan border, which resulted in chaos in America and it forced India not to go to war with Pakistan.
In this letter all the firepower of American was exposed.
In contrast, India has never threatened anyone, nor has the power to attack anyway.
The remaining damage is done by the Taliban attacking the American convoy.
This proved that, without the Pakistan military and government support, America is nothing.
Karachi is Pakistan's main business and finance city.  It is the Dubai of the rural areas.
Millions never returned from here, but when the law and order situation in western areas worsens then all the attention is directed towards Karachi.
Now they want to hijack this city.
For the first time, Pathans are called by Pakhtuns, which is making the city's people act like strangers and fight among each other. To be united is a necessity of the time.
One solution to this problem is that either the Urdu speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun speaking people learn Urdu, or better yet, both learn English.
You might think that this is a funny proposal, but does the cause of the conflict not seem funny?
That the cause of extremism be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, I actually shared this proposal many times in my childhood with my friends, which included people from all religious and linguistic groups but these people used to laugh at me.
At that time, the religious and linguistic hate which was not as lively and strong as they are today were still developing within.
I can never understand what is happening and why?
Are these the signs of the Day of Judgement?
For what crime are innocent people being killed?
The reasons are in front of everybody, those who want to break up Pakistan are the active ones and those who do such things have neither religion nor country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns.
Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir have to do with that which is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
At the height of the Mumbai attacks, the fact that the efforts to cause mischief on linguistic and racial lines in Karachi failed is proof that those politicians working on racial parole have resigned from their jobs.
The taking of the lives of innocent Pushtu speaking labourers and the Indian warnings have awakened the sleeping Pakistani feelings from Karachi to Khyber.
The identical country loving reaction of all the political, religious, linguistic and national parties has not only taught India the manners of diplomacy but it has also given the American policy makers a chance to think again.
The responsible parties for the worsening situation in Karachi are the United and the ANP, because the government is taking sides.
The government can control the situation in one hour, but it is purposely allowing it to grow.
The police and rangers are avoiding action because of the pressure on them by the political parties.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should disregard their other priorities and work more for the interest of the common man.
These kinds of situations will happen until political pressure stays on our leaders. Allah keep Pakistan safe.
In my opinion, they are the biggest terrorists.
Of course there are external powers active in this, but no one knows who they are.
The saddest part is if this kind of situation occurred in some city in Sarhad, the government would have done something, but if it is not in Sarhad, the government would be so helpless.
Government should do something effective here and save this country's big and important city.
Otherwise, Pakistan will face a serious economic setback.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth because they are scared. On the other hand Pakistan's media is even worse about reporting what they know.
The complete truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is for Urdu speaking people to learn Pashto or Pashto speakers to learn Urdu. Even better, everyone could learn English.
You will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but don't you think the reason for collision is ridiculous?
The reason for persecution may be language.
Another story of murder has finally been published in Karachi, a story that all the citizens dreaded seeing for a long time.
The criminals do not let any opportunity of crime go by. The news reports and media only tell 50% of what happened during a four day period.
I have spent the last three nights sleepless and the fear is still there.
There are those who make the people evacuate the hotels and those who kill the shoe-makers and peanut-sellers.
The people who rob and kill at the Super Highway and cut off the ears of innocent citizens are ignorant of the wrath of Allah which will eventually trap them.
In your opinion, what could be the reasons for this sudden turmoil?
(B.B.C)
Keeping in mind the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in Karachi. It is simple and easy to guess that the turmoil is just due to an unconscious trade of blood.
If somebody infuriates a father, it would not be surprising if the son reacts violently.
The blood of the loyalists of Liaqat Ali Khan also belonged to the same place, but to eliminate Mr. Psycho's misunderstanding I am writing this verse.
We will also repeat our elders traditions.
We made it by sacrificing lives, and will save it by doing the same.
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
It is very disappointing that the whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
See Liaqat Ali Khan, you will find out that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family from Karnal, in Punjab.
Due to his steps for the migrants, today the migrants consider him as one of them.
There is always a reaction to every action.
One can afford on oneself.
Ejaz Aiwan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are funding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating these kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan, they did not face any actions.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
One Muslim League N was left, even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q have made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment in the National Assembly and the Senate.
Till now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why  no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part that is they will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft, although the government speaker did not take any action.
MQM is the government in power, Muslim League N in the opposition and Muslim League Q the party who passed the 17th amendment; how is it possible that these parties will be sincere in finishing the 17th amendment?
This is what is called getting credit for nothing.
The people's party is already tardy about finishing the 17th amendment.
How can someone think of cutting off their own hands?
The 17th amendment will not be canceled until Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of the majority in our survey and it is also true.
If the 17th amendment was to be discarded, then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf. Because by supporting the president, he became the chairman of the People's Party.
The 17th amendment is valid until he is the president.
In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to bid Zardari farewell from the presidential house.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
Most of the elders in our family belong to the labor class.
During your childhood, when our uncles were doing their work, we prayed to Allah to protect us from physical labor.
To avoid this, we wrote to the editor of monthly Amroz to ask him what to do after matriculation so that we would not have to do physical labor.
The editor in reply wrote that we should become doctors or engineers.
We were inclined towards engineering, and studied technical drawing instead of biology.
But when we were admitted to FSc, our elder brother forced us to study medicine.
We had barely studied biology for a month before we started studying math.
To avoid physical labor we became engineers and are in better positions than many others, and we thank Allah for it.
We remembered this when with our two young sons we were trying to tear out old carpets.
Now it hasn't been half an hour while we were working that the small son said "Daddy it seems that I am not born for this job."
We replied, "that if that is so study good like us and build up your body."
The son started saying I am studying already, will be studying more but this work is not for me.
Anyhow, we three managed to complete the work within three hours and returned home.
The meaning of saying this is that if a man decides on one destiny then whatever comes afterward will not stop him to accomplish his destination.
Yes and if you don't really know what you have to do, then Allah is the only protector for you.
There is a saying that never say bad for a dead but what to do, also at the first death anniversary of Benazeer we only see bad in her.
Benazeer for her own benefit forwarded to India the Sikhs' army, who were going to fight the war of independence. On one side the independent movement of the Sikhs collapsed and on the other side gave chance for India to concentrate on Kashmir after pushing down the Punjab movement.
It is the due to the distraction ofthe leadership of Benazeer and Nawaz Sharif which have pushed the country to many years backwards.
During exile Benazeer continued on keeping the series beneficiary information of Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
During her rule, Benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make as much money as he could.  That is why he is known as Mr. Ten Percent.
During Benazir's rule, his brother got killed; but his murderers are still safe from any punishment.
Even though she was a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
Just as Benazir did her politics over her father's dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came into power twice, but she could not punish the culprits of her father's political murder, as even she couldn't register a case against them.
It has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us, but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders, demonstrated by the fact that we never celebrate the mourning day.
What should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated December 16 as a day for education and take such measures that this kind of incident doesn't take place again.
On this day we could send greetings to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to us again.
The rulers would reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Biharis trapped in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines of life from one day to the next.
If only East and West Pakistan could be one together just as East and West Germany were united once again.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem likely to be granted in the near future.
It was announced in the news today that the Governor of the American State Illinois had been arrested on corruption charges.
When the State Congress started getting ready to remove him from the position of governor as soon as possible, there was one American companion of ours who keeps a close watch on the circumstances of Pakistan, who boastfully claimed to us that this is what we call democracy.
In America, even the higher level people are not above the law.
The other is your country, Pakistan, where even the President was chosen after the corruption charges against him were dropped.
My vein of loyalty throbbed and I said what is the big deal if a governor was arrested in America. In our Pakistan, once the Prime Minister was arrested and hanged overnight, and another time sent into exile.
Tell me, when did this happen in America?
In Pakistan, those who broke the law were sent out of the presidential palace with a guard of honor. Tell me when this happened in America.
The Chief Justice of Pakistan was removed in such a manner, that despite having public support, he could not be replaced until now. Has this happened in America?
In Pakistan, a fake-degree holder was made the Minister of Health. Did this happen in America?
Hearing this, the American laughed till he was tired and conceded defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded on all four sides by Americans.
It seems from his smile that
He thinks that America is with his government. He is forgetting that one year ago, they were with Pervez Musharraf.
Thus psychotherapy gained popularity.
Whether there is madness in method or method in madness, there is certainly a method in dealing with madness.
That said, mental health care has come a long way from merely addressing dementia to dealing with problems such as stress, depression, anxiety and relationship problems.
She finished her MA in counseling psychology from Columbia University.
The center offers support services for depression, anxiety, stress, learning problems, and personality deficiencies.
Material problems and workplace issues.
It also offers employee assistance programs for corporations.
There are enough opportunities in the fields of counseling and psychotherapy.
Traditionally both roles were played by psychiatrists, who counseled patients.
Research has revealed that there are conditions which can be cured without medication.
Instead of using power, the government should find out the real causes of the problem.
Fazalullah and the Taliban will dissolve into nothingness if the root causes are terminated.
The Shariat bill suggested by the ANP administration will, to a great extent, bring a solution for the problems in Swat.
In addition to the observance of the Shariat law, the administration will take care of the well being of the people.
The actions of General Musharaf made us believe that we had been made free from the unqualified politicians of the land, but his ambition for more power changed everything.
How many expectations were there! He lost all hopes in "war and terror".
Hopes of taking actions were lost.
It seemed that he understood the end of his reign was imminent  along with the end of the Bush administration. As a result, thieves were recruited to power centers.
General Musharaf was in a position to control the army, but the present administration doesn't know what is happening.
The army could not put down the terror in Baajodoh and Swat. The commoners are subjected to "bombardments and enmity" I.E., creating great loss to lives and properties. It also puts them into a state of psychological disorder.
In Swat, the strongly affected part of Sarhad state, despite the continuity of military action for over one year, the situation is still going from bad to worse.    In Swat, a strongly affected part of Sarhad state, the situation is still going from bad to worse despite continuing military action that has lasted for over a year.
On one side, the government is only reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly. On the other side, the Taliban's illegal radio FM channel is having much more influence in the region.    On one hand, the government is only reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly.  On the other hand, the Taliban's illegal FM radio station is having much more influence in the region.
On the third side, the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region.    However, the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region.
During the action of the security forces, there were claims of destroying the fundamentalists by the bombing of gun ship helicopters and cannon houses, but despite these destructions, the Taliban only became more powerful, and according to an estimation, their control over Swat increased that much percent more.    During the action of the security forces, there were claims of destroying the fundamentalists by the bombing of gun ship helicopters and cannon houses, but despite these destructions, the Taliban only became more powerful, and it is estimated that their control over Swat increased considerably.
As a result, on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat, and on the other hand the Taliban is stronger.    As a result, the government is not ready to accept defeat while the Taliban has grown stronger.
Who is stuck in  between? The poor civilians.    Who is stuck in the middle?  The poor civilians.
It is said in Swat, that someone asked what kind of people are the Taliban were, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of Allah and the religion'.    In Swat, someone asked what kind of people the Taliban were.  The answer he got: "They are very good, as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of Allah and the religion."
Then he asked how the army was, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country'.    When he asked how the army was, he was told, "They are very good, as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country."
He then asked who the enemies of the religion and the country were.  "We civilians" was the answer.
I am wondering how the Pakistani Army will fight the Indian Army, when they couldn't control a small faction of the Taliban.    I am wondering how the Pakistani Army hopes to fight the Indian Army when they couldn't even control a small faction of the Taliban.
The Taliban's illegally operated FM channel could not be tracked down, which in my opinion is very easy.
Still, the FM channel was spreading hatred in full swing.
The boys schools are being destroyed after the girls schools.
Curfew is imposed so that tablibans can move around easily.
Tonight 8 trucks entered the suburbs of Mingora, during curfew, and created bunkers.
The question is that how could they reach there during curfew?
Army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house and salutes Taliban.
For Gods sake, someone tell this Army to protect the helpless people of Sawat from the Taliban and prove that the Pakistan army can overcome any enemy.
He says that most of the blood is spilt in the name of religion. Tell me, if religion didn't exist then blood wouldn't have spilt?
Punjabi, Pathan, White and Blank, Mehsood and other tribes, are these the products of religion?
No, not at all. A religion teaches that there is no white and no black, there is no Punjabi and no immigrants. If there was no religion, then humanity would have destroyed one another in the battle of black and white.
The religion only teaches the man how to be disciplined and mannered. Religion only shows the man that he has not come by himself; instead, he has been created by the supreme power, God, and He has sent you in this world to lead a life as per His orders.
Being a Muslim, I'm very sure that Islam is a complete religion. Moreover, it is a true religion.
Even after the time I acquired the luxuries in London, I continued to call up my relatives every morning to find out how they're doing, despite the fact that they had never done the same. Still, I continued to do so. There came a time when I felt that my relatives didn't appreciate the calls, so I stopped making calls to them after that.
Even I have felt the same here, since I have spent two years of my life in France.
Why people keep expectation only from us to make a phone call to them in Patna.
Regarding Iraq, there would be an Army sent for the "peace" in the Darfar within a few hours. This is not a problem for them.
The post action after the Mumbai Blasts and the security in the areas are a matter of few hours. Unclear as to the purpose of this sentence
There are discussions and opinions on the matter where there are more risk to death in the areas of Mumbai through any sources.
Hey, you: the protectors and leaders of the peaceful world. Life is being ended here only in discussions.
Is it really being waited to be diminished?
so that any again no aggrieved could even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights.
When a father is running carrying his beloved son's dead body, even then your hearts don't pinch with pain?
If not, then you don't even deserve to be called a human being.
But you are a black mottle over the name of humanity.
So at least this has been proven that this region has also been a homeland for Jews for centuries.
Ideally, these two nations should have lived in harmony, but since their strings are in Western and Arab hands, so without their will peace can not prevail in this region.
Now even Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
Even if the Israeli operation stops temporarily, it will start again any moment after any incident.
BBC's own country has its interests tied to America and Israel, and this is why while taking cover of enlightened moderation, it has started a series of blogs or Jews and doing a biased propaganda.
BBC is only completing a formality, and its goal and intent is only to gather well wishes.
I request the moderator to publish this comment from Fidwi, so that some truth may still remain on BBC.
Thank You.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How could I not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of a cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time, including Derah Gahzi Khan, summer showers are taking place throughout the country.
This is a poem about climate, enjoy the sweet rain as you read it.
It rains because of you
Rain is the sign of spring
As things come to a standstill, there is tranquility
Sometimes the rain comes with no reason
Often spreads wide in the night hours
Often the rain comes noisily, and often it is silent
It rains because of you
Whatever memory, whatever night
A silent music!
Sometimes he put it out.
Sometimes he lit himself up.
Sometimes every drop carries sorrow.
These rains are quite like you
All these leaders are about to run holding a very sensitive case, little do they care if the country survives or not.
Should the people sell their possessions or be wiping clean the temples with lemon peals?
And like our leaders, our media is corrupted as well.
Its sole purpose is to extract money from the government.
And the people are oblivious about this.
An odd incident took place yesterday at noon.
All of the policemen are running here and there, but aren't asking about illegal parking.
What's more, NYPD traffic was not in the state where it could look at illegally parked vehicles.
What happened was, a plane of the US Air transformed into a ship and landed in the Hudson river.
Until now, we only know that terrorists are descendants of geese.
It was historically cold in New York yesterday.
The temperature usually does not drop like this.
My jaws began to hurt from my thirty minute walk.
Imagine, how the people who jumped from the plane into the water felt.
It is a matter of happiness that all people were safe.
It was also sad that the company's plane sunk during this financial crisis.
I went by the West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I still do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, during my one-hour trip the way had opened at least a bit, so I was able to use the 56th street exit.
When I saw the lines waiting at them, I had not taken the previous two exits.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women.
Shaguftah: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak, to you too.
Sarah: I have slaughtered two chickens and how they are slaughtered and Jahanzeb has already mentioned how I did it.
Apart from this, there is no other way to do it.
At this farm one has to get his own meat done, including removing the skin.
Bossom:It may take some time for the Dot Net to get fixed
What happened on the forum?

Sir, use Firefox.

For no reason, we thought that the Taliban group from Sawat was non religious, and against education for women.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
Like the majority of the ideas, this was not proven right. According to CNN news, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a boys school with gunpowder.
Swat,claims The Taliban has destroyed a boys school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying ""Ladies First"". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Amen, then Amen.
Masha Allah, till now, 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom of fixing marriages before birth among Muslims, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight wasn't less, that there was news from India, that a girl was married to a frog.
See the picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
Some days go, a girl's marriage with a dog become fresh.
I can see that now.
Humanity is rare in the 21st century.
It is the age of computer. The computer has claimed it's place in every walk of life.
Many people have objections over using a computer to keep track of financial records.
Although credit card users have facility but their personal life is under more control of law enforcement agencies.
Now financial records can easily be tracked when someone uses their credit card.
In the future, when currency will not be used as often, it's importance will increase.
Criminals no longer risk robbing banks, when all they have to do is steal credit card information.
Additionally, there are times when friendships are created via computer.
Social networking sites such as Orkut, Facebook and Myspace have achieved an initial level of acceptance.
Yet, do you think it's possible that the more we use these social networking sites, the further we distance ourselves from people in real life?
Also consider match-making websites, where your preferences are matched to a list of people with similar desires as you.
But do you want to live with a person who is just like you?
I know that I would not want to.  Why else would a spouse be called the better half
unless they can get rid of the faults within me?
Perhaps I have some good sense.
I used to believe that anything that someone older than me said was true.
In the same way, I thought my father knew the answer to every question on earth.
I even used to get laughed at a lot for this.
But only that saying seemed true which could be possible.
The lie caused such an irritation but what was the reason to lie.
Bore loss on that saying even at this age
At the very least in my opinion you should lie.
If you misguide and be untruthful Allah knows.
Work will finish when we pray to Allah.
Allah knows the states intention.
The distance from religion causes disgust.
A minor child should also stay with parent or guardian according to Muslim and Pakistani law.
Their expense is due to their father and father can meet with children.
Then when the child comes of age he can stay with whomever he wishes.
You rightly mentioned that the actual problem is that of the relatives who mislead.
Possessiveness is present in all our actions.
That there will be new shareholders in the father's property is the very factor in effect over here because they will go against him.  Otherwise his father's action is commendable.
These restrictions have caused social evils, even in our marriages.
The concept of the marriage of a divorced woman or a widow has become obscure.
Wasteful ideologies and baseless traditions have made the family structure a mess.
When the the spouse of a 50-55 year old man or woman passes away, why are they not looked at in a nice manner in our society?
There is a Pakistani uncle whose wife passed away 10-12 years ago near us.  Now after marrying off all his children he has married a widow, so even his children have gone against him.
I believe this is his legitimate right. What do you say?
What type of mentality is the "while we are there, no one can take our mother's place" kind of mentality?
I believe that this person's children should have thought what is wrong if he married a widow, after he married off all his children?
Therefore, this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
The children would definitely have gotten busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow, if their wives refuse to look after them when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, the children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face those who taunt them and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society, which have been facing for the last 40-50 years.
A wife can accept that her husband has illicit relations, but she cannot stand him having a second wife.
If possible, stop him from doing so even after you die.
She destroys her husband and her own hereafter, and becomes a cause for spreading filth in society.
When chanting Islam, it does not mean anything. In reality, we only like our culture and traditions.
For instance, we try to keep girls from gaining education and are fearful of allowing a girl to marry someone of her choice.
As for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house, it was so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax, (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt).
In the Indo Pak subcontinent, Islam was accepted centuries ago, but it could not leave its ignorant mentality and has always kept culture and tradition above Islam.
Think of a man's second marriage as an innovation, divorce as a clinical rest, and divorced woman as untouchable. You must love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife. It is all a part of this mentality.
What's more, in mimicry of the western countries, we have started to consider piety and veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam is easy, but leaving this mentality is very difficult.
Allah, please grant us the spirit and courage needed for this.
Amen
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.
Centuries passed with very little written

Ameer Taimoor, in his book "I am Taimoor," writes how he discovered the secret that if the leader of any army offers himself up for the front line, that army will never lose.
But here, the situation is different.
Though it's said that the common people are there to die for us, if we die, it's considered martyrdom.
Yet, if a common person dies it should be considered murder.
AsSalaamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu (greeting)
Today, as I was returning to my shop after Isha prayer, a man sitting in a car at the circle raised his hand and drew my attention towards him.
I thought this man might have lost his way, or he might want to ask something, so I stopped, and saw his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked whether I could understand Arabic or not. I said no problem, tell me what you want.
He started to say that "I have come from Riyadh, to Madinah, but someone has pick-pocketed me, so please help me out." I asked him to excuse me, as such an incident had taken place with me previously, that I had given the person 20 Riyals to buy petrol to reach Riyadh, but he went a little ahead and started to ask somebody else.
I got very angry and scolded him and warned him that I would call the soldiers, he got very frightened.
Now the situation  has become, that we Muslims come in cars, with our families to beg throughout the day and gain at least two or three thousand Riyars illegally.
Whereas there is a clear Hadith of the Prophet that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand; the lower hand being the begging hand and the upper hand being the giving one.
May Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims (Amen, Amen).

Famous singer Adnan Sami's wife reached a police station in Mumbai, accusing him of torturing her.
The Police station advised her to contact a court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Giladari gave a complaint against her husband saying that he continuously tortures her.
and that he treats her in a non-human manner.
Now, it has become difficult for her to bear, and that is why she has filed a case against him.
The police, instead of filing a case, told her to contact a court, saying that this matter was not one which the police could touch.
In your opinion, is the accusation against Adnan Sami, by his wife proper?
This is not an Indian effort to disgrace Adnan Sami, is it?
Let us know about your opinion on this issue.
Adam, Sanghad, Mehr
As far as accusations go, any person can accuse another.
To become enraged in the name of honor is not sensible.
Whatever be the case between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he left his honorable life and went to India to earn money. Now that fame has fallen around his neck.
This is a result of his own actions.
Washington...
High ambassadors from America say that President Obama will take a strong stand against Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
In America's new policy for Afghanistan war has been given more importance than development.
The envoys say that Hamid Karzai is being considered a barrier in the achievement of American goals in Afghanistan, as there is corruption in government and the business of middlemen has increased while the Taliban are once more gathering strength.
The American envoys say that Vice President Joseph Biden and President Obama's representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Hallbrooke, are among the people in the American government who are stressing upon Hamid Karzai to do something more.
He said that this good administration was noticed after the President Bush left, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai after every 2 weeks and used to emphasize on the role of America in Afghanistan and the development of its city departments.
Officials say that the Obama management will work with the state leaders as a backup with the main government.
Officials say that they will emphasize Hamid Karzai on fighting against corruption.
Hamid Karzai faces new elections this year. And it is not clear as yet that Obama and his companions will favor his presidency or not.
Is this statement, of the American officials, a forecast of change in American policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is this era of Hamid Karzai ending?
What are your thoughts in this matter?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and SriLanka, Srilanka defeated Pakistan with 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Srilanka in the first one-day match although Srilanka won in the next two matches.
In this third one-day match, the nation's team performance was very poor. They worn out in only 75 runs in 23 overs against 309 runs made by the national team of Srilanka. And this is how we faced a lesson learning defeat.
The result of the series proves that the national team has no consistency in its performance.
Besides having the home ground and all other claims, the national team was defeated. What are the reasons of this in your opinion?
Which departments of the game should be addressed more by the authorities?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
Which department will you hold responsible for the defeat - fielding, batting or bowling?
Please provide your feedback.
It is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish traditions continue. These feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule, so who would call them Muslims?
A Sardar should walk himself over these embers. Why doesn't the present government act against them?
That is when the judicial justice will come in handy.
The Srilankan cricket team has now arrived in Karachi to play One Day internationals.
Despite the tensions between Pakistan and India, it is nice to see a foreign team visit Pakistan.
On reaching the Karachi Airport, the Sirilankan team was given a warm welcome.
There will be two one-day matches in Karachi, and one in Lahore between Pakistan and Sirilanka.
There have been bold statements from both sides regarding their bowling, batting, and fielding.
If the Sirilankans are proud of their spinners, then Pakistan has its fast bowlers.
The Sirilankan Captain, Mahela Jayawardene, has said that no one player of the Pakistan team can be singled out as a threat - the whole team is dangerous.
Muralitharan and Mendis are said to be trump cards while the Pakistani Captain has said that the competition will be a tough one.
Shoaib Malik said that they've already played Muralitharan and that they'll see off Mendis as well. He also said that they've got a secret game plan that they'll reveal on the pitch.
Can it really be that according to the Pakistani and Sirilankan claims the contest will be a gripping one?
Who will have the upper hand when the series between Pakistan and Sirilanka gets underway?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Give your opinion.
Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.

The Kashmiri people have been fighting for independence for the last 60 years.
Since no one asked, they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism. So, they start talking about making up.
First, they openly killed the Muslims. Now, they are in the efforts of setting things right.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies.

India is creating such a situation so that the world's attention can be diverted from Kashmir.
but Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
The British Government is now also beginning to understand that the Indians are diverting attention from their occupation of Kashmir by accusing Pakistan of terrorism,
and they hesitate to enter into talks with Pakistan over this issue.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that resolving the Kashmiri issue will bring an end to extremism, and allow the government of Pakistan effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
Newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister, while talking to media in Mumbai, states that the premise of the War Against Terror is wrong and that killing people just for the threats to one's self was president Bush's policy.
David Milliband has also stated that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Is India using terrorism as a basis to escape from comprehensive dialog?
Let us know your opinion.
Usman Aftab,
I think the big powers do not want conflict with Pakistan.
Rather, it wants to keep it in check, and hence is thinking of taking steps that will not provoke them. They know that Pakistan is a nuclear state.
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries are only thinking that if they corner Pakistan, they would face political and geographic problems of an unknown scale. They want to help Pakistan, but also want to be successful in their goal.
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is a Ram.
I think that they get nervous over small issues and then warn Pakistan.
We are ready by all means. The Indian Army chief should keep his mouth shut.

Political statements are mischievously being supported by America. America is crazy and now Indians are following in their footsteps. If India has the courage to attack, it should be aware of reality on the ground.
Israel is attacking Hamas and no one has the courage to stop them. Mimicking Israel, India also wants to have an adventure.
The Prime Minister said that Byden had a pivotal role in removing Musharraf and restoring the democracy. That is why he was awarded the SI.
No political party can claim the credit of removing him and the restoring democracy. Parliament does not give out rubber stamps.
All decisions will be made in Parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Dr. Qadir's chapter had been closed.
Does public protest against dictatorship have no significance to you?
Did the lawyers movement did not play any role?
What are you going to do at Prime Minister's statement?
Please give us your opinion.
American President George W. Bush, in his last Press conference advises newly elected President that he had many mistakes in his tenure and Barack Obama should do what he think is right.
I, as the President and according with the constitution of USA and law, I did the developments, I put forward American interest against my own popularity.
He said that America's enemies are still planning to attack America. The biggest challenge for Barack Obama is to prevent these attacks.
He said that, unable to find the weapon of mass destruction from Iraq was his major dissapointment and to announce the mission completed in Iraq was his big mistake.
In the last press conference from white house, American president has said that this is my last press conference I thank you all, news reporters and my colleagues who attended this conference.
Do you think Obama will not make the same mistakes as Bush did?
Don't you think Bush was late in accepting his mistakes?
Will Obama be able to follow the advice of Bush?

Manmohan Singh once again accused Pakistan of creating a war-like atmosphere.
Pakistan is using terrorism as a policy of state.
Speaking to a meeting of the cabinet of ministers, Manmohan Singh said that terrorist factions are being supported by neighboring countries, especially Pakistan.
And the terrorists who attacked Mumbai used the seaway and remained safe from the coastal guard.
The Indian Prime Minister said that the Mumbai attacks of November were carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba.
He said that the terrorists were using new techniques and modern communication systems. We will have to step up the forces at the line of control as well, from where there is infiltration. He said that terrorism will not be accepted in any form, and this is our policy.
How do you view this accusation of the Indian prime minister?
Do the internally opposed and separatist movements of India show the disturbed situation n India?
On whose orders is India taking this warning stance?
Give us your views.

This is a sad calamity that Israeli is massacring the Palestinians and the same situation is prevalent in Kashmir, but there is no effect on the Security Council.
All factions in Palestine and Kashmir should keep their war going until they gain independence, and they should form unity among themselves and keep facing any type of harm, and one day or the other their martyrdom will give fruit, God Willing.
The air attacks by Israel on Gaza are continuing, just the same. To date, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
Important Hamas leader Nazariyan was killed along with his wife and children.
The UN Security Council meeting concluded without any decision.
The meeting saw American opposition to the resolutions passed criticizing Israel by Libya and other Arab countries.
Israel's jet planes have been bombarding residential areas of Palestine for the last few days.
Many countries around the world have begun protesting against the Mumbai attacks. Why can't others, including Americans and Britains see this brutality?
Why have major Muslim countries been silent?
What is your opinion of these double standards in the world?
Saeed, New York.
In my opinion, the basic fact is that most of our people are uneducated, and they don't even know where their money is actually going. The shortfall of electricity and gas will continue in the same manner. The government feels it is doing its job properly by applying and collecting taxes.
Because everyone knows the character of those who have been elected in our own nation.
Electricity and gas all over Pakistan has is in a critical state.
On the other hand, the GAS tariff has been raised to 8%. In some cities unavailability of petrol is increasing the difficulties and miseries of the masses.
Severe reaction to the electricity and gas crisis in Pakistan's industrial and business sector is occuring. Riots and violent protests are taking place.
Industry holders gave an ultimatum to stop the mills.
Here there is unbelievable situation in cities by the load shedding of light in Karachi from 8 to 10 hours.
The industrial became approximately hand less and feet less.
Government institutes are blaming each other.
The nation will not accept an increase in the price of either electric or gas.
We did not pay attention and now must solve these problems.
The government is not going to work for upwards.
What will you suggest to control this big problem.
I am aware of your opionion.
After the loss of Imram there are as many people as there are commanders.
I wonder those who shout slogans for an administration of the public create nuisance to the public.
It is torture not to get jelly, petroleum and gas.
Government departments have lost control.
Law and order has degenerated. May Allah show his mercy  on this country of ours.
A new year has begun.
Last year was a year of political turmoil and chaos. The year will be remembered for terrorism too.
President Musharaf's stepping down from power, the end of President Bush's eight years' reign, the slinging of chappals to Bush, the rethroning of democracy in Pakistan,the unexpected disasters, the earthquake in Baloochistan, the financial melt down all over the world,the depression in the market
The new year has set in. How do you feel now at the new year's arrival?
In your opinion, What shape will the political and geographical situations in the country take? What policies will Obama adopt?
Is it possible to predict an end to the threatening terrorism?
Will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?
What turn will the Indo-Pakistani relations take?
Is there any chance of a surgical strike, or maybe a full-fledged war?
What are your expectations for the new year?

It is the first anniversary of the death of Benazir Bhutto. She was slain after an election rally in Liaqat Bagh, Rawalpindi on December 27th, 2007.
Unfortunately, Benazir is not among us today. She was a thoughtful politician and a world renowned figure. She held a special status in national politics.
It's been a full year now, yet the enigma of her death still remains unsolved.
Benazir's efforts to bring democracy to Pakistan were not in vain.
Today a democratic government exists in Pakistan and her husband, Asif Zardari, currently holds the position of Pakistan President.
What role does the martyr Benazir Bhutto have in Pakistani politics?
Who can be behind murdering her?
Recently she was given the Global Human Rights award. What would you like to say about her democratic and political services?
After ruling over America for eight years, President Bush left for Camp David, a presidential retreat, to allow the White House to be decorated according to the wishes of his successor, president-elect Barack Obama.
Some of the memorable events of the Bush presidency include the 9/11 attacks, the subsequent wars against terrorism in Afghanistan and Iraq, and their effects on American and other countries' resources.
As a result of these wars, America had to face the worst economic and financial crisis in its history.
What do you think the world gained and lost as a result of these wars?
Were the policies of President Bush successful?
What are your views of the Bush era?
The Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from touring Pakistan.
The Indian Cricket Team had to play three tests, five one day matches and one twenty on Pakistan Tour.
Vice president of the Indian Cricket Board, Rajeev Shukla, said that the board has asked the government to allow the Pakistan Tour but because of the serious matters between the two countries this tour is not possible.
Is it right to use available political issue of the Indian government as the passport to cancel the cricket tour, the games must not be kept away from politics?
Isn't the decision of the Indian Government about cricket a loss?
Even though the security in India was poor, the English Cricket Team tour was going on, so why don't the Indian team do the Pakistan Tour?
What is your opinion in this regard?
Salman, Karachi.
People feel proud about going to India.
And their films and videos are made there; now their eyes must open to see that how much the Indian people respect you.
I remember one interview of Adnan Samee where he said "I am not a Pakistani, my popularity is British."
Adnan Sami knows that he should come to Pakistan at the first opportunity because respect was not given to him even there.
Fareed Ahmad
Karachi
Indian's attitudes have changed after the Mumbai attack.
Jagjit showed his reaction to this by hating Pakistan and the Pakistani people.
It should be known that Adnan Sami sung seven songs of Asha Bhosla, and now how can he be out of tune? Adnan Sami should stay in India. There is no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam
I will only say this about the statement of Jagjit Singh - he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements suitable to the situation? Pakistanis - open your eyes. How much are you given worth in India? Try to understand the thinking of Hindu.
After the Mumbai incident, their hateful statements have increased, and now they are spitting poison against popular singer Adnan Sami.
Without my permission at all, a dream takes place in my mind. I must have a house in a beautiful evergreen valley. There must be flowering trees on top of the hill.
Each morning at least one among the flowers that fall from the trees should reach the valley, where my small nest-like house is situated.
The second thing was that about your future.
At night, while sleeping on the terrace, I must be able to view the whole star-bloomed sky.
Seeing the melting mist in the valley, seeing the gold- bangled hands working in the tiled kitchen, watching my hard work blooming up in the compound.
Looking at the twinkling stars, feeling the softness of fondling fingers, inhaling the fragrance of night jasmine.
What is your opinion about this?
By wearing a mask repeatedly, you have lost your face. You have developed the art of having the brightness of truth even while uttering point-blank lies.
I was always dominated by an uncontrollable thirst for affection.
When my problem is something concerned with money.
There are many problems facing the people of the world. Many things are not under the control of human beings.
I think it's mainly caused by people not thinking properly, that's the real cause.
It's hard to face the problems that may arise in the world's future.
Today we should start working for the well being of everyone.
What do you think of that idea, really?
Poverty, financial crisis, diseases are the main challenges that people are going to face in the world in the future.
What were people thinking?
Start today. Are you ready?
We firmly decide today how to solve the problems. It won't be easy. There are risks. But first we should think carefully, and have an attitude toward improvement.
The world has faced many calamities such as earthquakes, floods and tsunami among others. But we still don't prepare well enough for such disasters.  We're good at clean up after disasters but our scientist need to find ways of prediction.

While it is is true that she was martyred, we must also remember that she killed many innocents in Karachi.  Additionally, she was proud of the job done by Naiseer Ullah Baber.
Now, she has totally changed.
It is also true that he neglects the senior people in his party and instead chose his son as the party leader.  What kind of Democracy is this?
Jimmy Noor, Karachi, this news supported what Quran said -that Non-believers will support only Non-Believers.
An axe cannot cut wood until it does not have a wooden handle.
Our rulers are responsible for the hardships and problems that our country is currently facing.
May God bless our rulers with rightness.

They have to face the cases.
Are these sanctions not  made under the influence of Indian propaganda?
Why is India blaming these parties for the Bombay attacks without any proof?
Aren't there any terrorist groups in India?
Are international groups not aware of the tortures being done upon the minorities in India?
