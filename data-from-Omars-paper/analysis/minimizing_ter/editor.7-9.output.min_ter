First Nuclear Test Done in 1990.
Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer, had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.
In this book called 'Nuclear Express,' the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.
Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990 during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Thomas Reid said that, due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Among the factors are the design of the bomb and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.
He further added this was the reason that Pakistan was able to respond to India's Nuclear test with a nuclear test in just 2 weeks and 3 days.
Thomas Reid reminded us that in 1961 Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test, in response to which America took 17 days to perform a test, despite having had this bomb for a long time.
He added that the atom bomb that was tested on May 19th 1998 by Pakistan was made very carefully, and that Pakistani scientists had complete faith in it.
When Thomas Reid was asked whether China had provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.
He said that there was proof that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and that the documents received from Libya will verify this fact.
Upon further questioning as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.
He said that we also believe that Israel has access to the results of this testing.
Thomas Reid was also asked about China's nuclear distribution program which is ongoing.
In answer, Thomas Reid said that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Esfahan, Iran since 1991.
In conjunction with this, China provided Iran with the nuclear enrichment plant in Kheraj.
He said that China has been providing Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, and Libya with nuclear technology through North Korea.

The law minister of Punjab, Rana Sanaullah Khan, says that supervisors were appointed in the center of Jamaa'athud Da'wah so that the work of social institutes there can go on unaffected.
According to Khalid Waleed, son in law of the Jamaa'athud Da'wah chief Hafiz Saeed, a high ranking government officer, Khaqan Babar, was appointed to supervise the hospital, school and other social institutions based in the center as the administrator.  According to Saeed, the police presence at the center was also increased.
The Security Council has passed a ban on Jamaa'athud Da'wah, after which the Pakistani government has started taking action against Jamaa'athud Da'wah across the country, and has put the chief of the Jamaa'ath, Hafiz Saeed, along with other leaders under house arrest. The appointment of the administrator in the Taibah center by the Punjab government was also a part of the action being taken against Jamaa'athud Da'wah by the joint government.
Khaqan Babar belongs to the DMG (District Management Group).
Hafiz Khalid Waleed said that the Commissioner of Lahore division, Khusroe Pervez Khan, along with police and the civil government, came on Sunday and inspected the Taibah center. Khalid Waleed criticized the appointment of an administrator by the government in Jamaa'athud Da'wah, and said that the number of patients in the hospital and children in the school had already dropped due to government actions.
According to a press release by Jamat-ud-Dawa, party chief Hafiz Saeed has written a letter for the General Secretary of United Nations, Ban Ki Mon, and Committee for Taliban, in which a request is made to cancel the restrictions on the party made by the Security Council.
It says in the letter that the one sided decision of the Security Council on banning Jamat-ud-Dawa is unfair. And Jamat-ud-Dawa has no relation with terrorism but it is busy in charitable activities.

Bitterness between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Israeli president, almost screaming, that the blood of many humans were spilled in Gaza, and it saddened him to see that people could watch and applaud this armed killing from Israel.
Mr. Erdogan said, "I believe that you are using such words to erase your guilty feeling, and out loud, as well. But you killed those people, and I am remembering those children who were killed near the shore."
Simon said that Gaza's calamity is not Israel, but Hamas, who have established a dangerous dictatorship over there.
A BBC journalist from Davos said that he had never seen such a scene in an global economic forum before.
However, Erdogan later stated that he respected the Israeli president and his age, which is why he did not scream at him, but whatever he was saying was very far from the truth.
Turkey is one of the few Muslim countries which has a diplomatic relationship with Israel, but displeasure has been materializing between the two recently.

These are the two places (Pakistan and Britain) about which I was worried.
India and the international community have created a lot of pressure on Pakistan to take action against the culprits of the Mumbai attacks.
Wajid Shamsul Haq said: "We are not trying to cover it up."
We believe in taking action based on facts.
the world will accept our investigations.
We will try to satisfy India as to the results (of the investigation).

Role of EU for Peace in the Middle East.
From the official point of view, the role of the European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
According to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
European Union's spokesman Amadeu Altafaj has said that every such effort is admirable which is helpful in sending the European Union's message to the opponents of the war.
Everything seems fine, as far as the official statement is concerned.
But in reality the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
As the head of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is even weaker than before.
And on top of that the internal issues have made it helpless.
On the other hand, the French President, Sarkozy, is behaving as if he is still the President of the European Union.
France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role, and he is capable of it, but he does not have the permission to do so.
The most comedic situation is for the Ambassdor of France Mr. Bernard Kouchner.
He is also involved in this, with guidance from the Ambassador of the Czech Republic, Mr. Schwarzenberg.
Not only do their opinions differ, they also might have to face a battle with the western world.
They announced that for the defense of Israel they might have to face the war, even though there doesn't appear to be any need for this. Germany also posted a person towards the East's defense. Until the European Union come to an agreement, they won't win the battle.
This is the proof of Israel, which is doesn't provide any response to the European Countries.
This is the best time for the European Union to perform because America has failed on the western side due to the policies of George W. Bush.

The aim of advertising is always to sell the product or let the people know the various facilities made available to them either at the market or at their doorstep.
When a product is being advertised we are able to gather more information such as its name, price, benefits and availability.
But sometime the drafted messages tends to be fictional, owing to either exaggeration or to false claims made by the advertiser. Viewed objectively, the advertising message must act as a salesperson and do its best to convince the consumer of the merits of the product.
The words used in advertisements are typical of a salespersons' language and this is how he would like to convince his prospective buyer, should they come face-to-face.
The name of this advertisement is Ratiopharm. The words used by the salesperson definitely praise the product or service that is available.
More often, they are colorful and catchy words as they persuade the customer to respond favorably and force him to purchase the product. Unless cosmetics and other like Kassbohrer products are heavily promoted, they will languish unsold on the shelves of this stores for a long time.
So, advertising always puts forward the best points of the product. Advertisement can be educational, entertaining, informative, handy and surely interesting.
At times, however, they tend to be boring, irritating, incredible and embarrassing.
Another category of advertisements tends to brag so as to tempt the buyers.
But whatever it may be, advertisements have a two-fold purpose to serve. They have a message to convey and they attempt to evoke a desirable response in the buyer. As a result 400 VEM product become popular ones and the demand increases.
this way Merchlay group will stay as it used to be after the death of Adolph Merchley

According to latest statistics the crime rate among immigrants from 2004 till 2007 is 22%.
Decline from 9 to 0.21%
has reached 4 percent
According to Interior minister Joachim Herrmann of the province Bavaria, this is a superficial positive change.
He said "It should be noted that that the number of outsiders seeking immigration to Germany is increasing."
Hence, this should also be stated in statistics that the criminal is a German citizen but his background is non-immigrant.
He said that his province will also consider this while collecting statistics.
A part from Bavaria the same is being planned in Hamburg.
A senator for foreign affairs from CDU, Christoph Ahlhaus, has said: "When research is done in a scientific manner, man can not pre-decide its results but it is based on the facts and figures that come out as a result of the research."
Ahlhaus diverted the attention to a research report from the anti crime's provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamberg, it was investigated that out of all crimes happening there what percentage have the involvement of foreigners.
results showed that the foreigners here have
Tthe crime rate was less as compared to crime all over the province.
By contrast, when a survey was done in 2006 on crimes in youth in Berlin, it was determined that young people having foreign background had a percentage of 44%.
was 7 percent
However, other political parties of Germany for example, SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei,were against this proposal that while collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired which German citizens have foreign backgrounds.

For the last few years, AL-Qaeda has been distributing messages over the internet and there have been attacks after such messages.
The militant group the Taliban has taken responsibility for the terrorist attack outside the German Embassy this weekend.
Most German papers and analysts are linking this attack with the message of Al Qaeda.
They are targeting Germany.
Muslim hard liners see Germany's Afghan policy in a negative and questionable light.
They blame the German government for adopting biased policies not just towards Afghanistan, but also toward the Middle East.
And for this reason they are increasingly finding Germany as their enemy.
The German government stated that undercover agencies knew about the video even before it came out publicly.

In this regard, the German Chancellor Angela Merckle has expressed confidence in the American president.

"In this regard, I am sure that in the coming weeks and months, Obama and his team of economists will put immense pressure on China to have a more flexible and competitive market exchange rate for the Chinese currency."
The former American regime has also improved its relations with India.
As to how far Obama can take these relations, Christopher Raj, professor of American Studies in New Delhi says, "Now we have come closer in strategic partnership. However, Obama can not bring an overnight change."
Pope Benedict's message to President Obama stressed the need to create an environment of peace and mutual help in the world.
State Elections in Israel
This is the first important election in this war-torn country since 2005.
More than 14,400 people entered the race for 440 seats in the state elections.
To maintain peace and safety during the elections, 800,000 police and soldiers were posted in Iraq.
Fearing that some bomb blast or terrorist attack might take place on this important day, all the borders of Iraq were sealed one day in advance, i.e. on Friday.
Also, airports were closed and restrictions were placed on public transportation.
According to reports, due to the restrictions on public transport, there was no traffic on the roads of Baghdad, and children were seen playing football on the roads.

The state elections are being held with help from the United Nations and almost 800 international supervisors are overlooking the elections.

Israeli Troops' Retreat from Gaza Corridor and a Stern Defense Put up by Palestine Fighters.
According to Mahar news reports of the Urdu service, even on the 16th day of the battle between good and evil, the Israeli troops showered bombs on city dwellers. 880 people have so far been martyred in the land-sky-sea attack by Israeli troops and 3700 Palestinians have been severely injured.
The martyrs include 275 innocent children. They embraced death smiling at the faces of deceitful Arab leaders and the organizations pretending to be working for international human rights.
The Israeli troops were forced to leave Ujain in Gaza today because of the strong resistance of the masked Palestine soldiers. They exhibited magnificent defense with the help of their strong faith and desire for sacrifice. They engaged in a do or die battle against the Zionist enemies.
But for the treacherous stand of the Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, the brave and solid fighters of Hamas would have thrown the Israeli troops into the pit of shameful defeat. Unfortunately, the Egyptian Muslims also kept the Palestinians under siege along with the Israeli troops. It is the most tragic incident in the history of Arabia.
It can be seen that Saudi Arabia and the Udar government extend political as well as financial assistance to Israel. Similarly, they join hands with Israel to deceive the Musalmans of Gaza who endure unending miseries.
Barak Obama and America weave new evil strategies against Iran.
According to the Mahar news agency, the elected President of America, Barak Obama, while talking to the ABC news channel, said that new and modern strategies would be adopted in dealing with the Iran affairs.

President Bush said that he did everything for the protection of America.
In response to several questions asked about Israeli aggression in Gaza, President Bush replied that Israel has the right to protect herself but Hamas does not. Hamas should not attack Israel, and like America, the whole world should strangle the oppressed instead of the oppressor.
America's most incompetent and ineligible president said that Hamas should not be provided arms. However, America is giving the most devastating weapons to Israel, who are using these weapons in the genocide of Palestinians. Also criticized pro Israeli Arabs and declared them friends of Israel.
Bush was embarrassed about the crimes committed in Abu Garib and Guantanamo bay prisons.
Experts say that Bush should be put on trial for war crimes and the organizations who will do this will do great benefit to mankind.
Iranian President Ahmedi Nizad Regrets Silence of Arab Countries.
According to all news agencies, Iranian president Doctor Ahmedi Nizad has strongly criticized the silence of Arab leaders on the Israeli aggression and oppression.

President Ahmede Nejad has said in his message: "You know that for the last 19 days Israel has been bent upon human genocide, murdering innocent children, and subjecting homes, mosques, schools and hospitals to barbaric bombing. The Zonist Regime is brutally murdering the unarmed Muslims in Gaza. In situations like these, silence on the part of leaders like you is only encouraging Israel."
President Ahmede Nejad has told Malik Abdullah that even non- Muslim countries like Venezuela and Bolivia have taken concrete steps against Israel and that he is expected to take better steps.
President Ahmede Nejad told the Palestinians that success will be at their feet in Gaza.
and the oppressed will win over the oppressors and that's Allah's promise.
President George Bush: Terrorism is Still a Threat to USA
MEHER/MAHAR news agency has copied from the German news agency that the US President, while addressing his successor Barak Obama and the nation in his farewell speech, said that though the US is safer than it was seven years ago, the threat of terrorism still looms over USA.
Bush said that the enemy terrorists are waiting patiently to attack America, and they have a strong determination to attack America so America should never be unaware about its security.
The American President ignored the hurt and suffering of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, and defended his policies saying that America is still the biggest supporter country of independence. However, commentators do not accept the reality of the unpopular president's remarks, as America is neither a supporter of freedom, nor a supporter of human rights, but rather it is the most mischievous country in the world, which not only supports a bloodthirsty country like Israel, but is also directly involved in its crimes.
Israel openly kills children, women and civilians and the American president is congratulating them. This is the American humanity and freedom which the world is seeing in Gaza and other places.
Usama Hamdan: Presence of army in Palestine continues
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, Usamah Hamdan,  the Hamas leader in Lebanon, told French News Agency during an interview that a one-sided ceasefire from the Israeli side is against the comprehensive international efforts for a ceasefire. He said that as long as Israel is present in Gaza, a one-sided ceasefire is meaningless.
He said that the one-sided ceasefire was an unsuccessful effort of Israel to escape defeat. Hamdan said that if Israel wants long-term peace, it will have to accept Hamas's conditions as well as end this siege.
The Hamas leader in Lebanon made it clear that if Israel tries a one-sided ceasefire with its army remaining in the Gaza belt, there will be resistance against it.
Addressing a one-way conference from Beirut, Usamah Hamdan called for European nations to break ties with Israel.
The Hamas leader said that the increasing numbers of the martyred and injured will only increase our determination.
He told the Palestinian public to stay firmly rooted and resist the enemy like a boulder.
Taliban Killed 6 in Pakistan's Tribal Area North of Wazirastan.
Meher Reporting Agency copied references from Rueters that the Taliban killed 2 Afghans and 4 Pakistanis over accusation of espionage in Pakistan's tribal area of north Wazirastan.
According to reports, on Tuesday morning locals found four dead bodies from Tehsil Chowk in Tehsil Mir Ali, who were shot dead.
Whereas two dead bodies were found in capital Miranshah; who were thrown in the market of a Bazaar.
Letters written in Urdu have also been found near the dead bodies in which it is claimed that the dead were involved in espionage.
Also, two weeks earlier, in Miranshah, the capital of north Wazirastan, two Afghanis were killed over accusations of espionage.
Over the last twelve days, fifteen people have been killed over charges of espionage for America.
It should be noted that during last six years, more than a hundred people have been killed in South and North Wazirastan on accusations of espionage. Taliban members are accused of being involved in these murder cases.
Obama Expected to Undersign Closure Orders of the Infamous Guantanamo Bay Prison.
Mehr Reporting Agency has cited sources that say the American president will sign off on the closure of the infamous Guantanamo Bay prison.
The new American president, Barack Obama, started working on his campaign promises at the surface level.
In this regard, President Obama called for making a plan for recalling the army from Iraq, while the American president will sign an order today to close the notorious Guantanamo Bay prison.
It is expected that President Barack Obama will probably sign the order today by which the Guantanamo prison will be closed within one year.
Apart from this, the White House is expected to revise suspected terrorism investigation methods and ban ill treatment of prisoners during interrogation.
President Barack Obama started to fulfill his election campaign promises from his first day in office, and first of all started by taking steps toward making the actions and workings of the government transparent.
Experts say that the American president has begun efforts to save the falling image of America throughout the world. That will be difficult, because as long as it keeps supporting the bloodthirsty Israeli government, it can not be expected to do anything good. Therefore, if America wants to save its image, it will have to stop its support of Israel and disassociate itself from Israel's crimes.
Tony Blair stresses need to include Islamic organization, Hamas in talks
Mehr news agency quoted from British newspaper The Times that former Prime Minister Tony Blair stressed the need to include Hamas in the talks to bring about peace in the Middle East.
According to the newspaper, Tony Blair said that it is important that a path be found for bringing Hamas into the Middle East peace process. Blair criticized the Bush administration for speaking only to Mahmood Abbas and ignoring Hamas. It should be clear that the western countries have realized the democratic and organizational powers of Hamas and are calling for bringing them into the talks, whereas previously they used to consider it a terrorist organization. A terrorist organization which is trying to defend its country and struggling to save its own house from the clutches of others. Whose house and country have been in the hand of the occupying Israeli government for 60 years.

In his words, "These people try to secretly blow up schools and frighten the boys and girls".
Talking about the environment of fear and insecurity, he said that the local government knows well and wants it to be known that no force can stop the spread of education in the land of the Pukhtons.
One day ago, the Taliban soldiers, led by Moulana Fazlullah demanded the banning of girls from studying in Swat's educational institutions from the 15th of January.
Despite the military activity going on in Swat during the last one and a half years, about 150 educational institutions were destroyed by the militants by the use of explosives and arson.
Due to the destruction of these educational institutions; thousands of girls and boys were deprived of the facility of education.

Tea: A good cure for breast cancer
According to a new research, drinking three cups of tea every day
reduced the chances of breast cancer by more than one third  in women less than 50 years old.
In research conducted by the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida in the United States, it has been found that women less than 50 years old that have the breast cancer oncogene
reduced their chances of breast cancer by 37 percent among those who drank three cups of tea a day.
The research shows that the aged women don't get any effect from drinking three or more cups of tea a day.
The researchers think that the tea contains elements that are effective against the special type of onco in the breast cancer (that effect the women younger then 50 years age)
In Moffitt Cancer Center, in the city of Tampa, Florida state, a research was conducted on over 5000 women, who had undergone treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles with women who were safe from breast cancer.
The experts found that the drinking of tea showed a definite relationship to a specific form of cancer called lobular cancer, decreasing its occurrence by 66 percent.
A tenth of every breast cancer patient suffers this type of cancer.
This type of cancer is more dangerous because it is deeper and is usually only known after it spreads quite a bit.
Experts say that regular tea consumption, at least three cups a day, can drastically reduce the occurrence of breast cancer in young women.
They add that having tea on a daily basis is an excellent defense against this cancer.
In Britain, approximately 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year.
Biggest Military Challenge Facing Americans in The War in Afghanistan is Gas!
American Defence Minister Robert Gates has said that the biggest Military challenge to America is the war in Afghanistan

Why reduction in exercise with increase in the age
New Research
Exercise is good for health in every age
Exercize keeps the heart healthy,reduces the level of cholesterol, helps in keeping the weight low, helps in reduction of blood sugar, and decreases the progress of dementia.
Unfortunately, in many older people, the capability to carry out exercise is low.
Medical specialists say that with exercise, our body and brain remain active, but age can have an effect.
The American Medical Association says that Many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out.
Doctor Patricia Pellikka of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says that the reason for the increase in age is due to lack of exercise and less bodily functionality.
Dr. Pellikka teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.
She researched heart illnesses in elderly people and the benefits of exercise.
A team of doctors used high frequency layers of sound to test the functioning of the heart.
in which they studied the work the heart, the compressing, and the resting of the heart.
The experts had given full attention on the left side of the heart which is the important part where the blood is pumped.
They came to know that with the growing age the grievousness is added in the respiration work of the heart.
Dr. Patrisha says that as people age, the heart's job in assisting respiration becomes harder, and the effect becomes more obvious with the inclusion of exercise.
Dr. Garven Ken also participated in this research.
They say that we were surprised to see that the heart is effected and it is now clear that without proper exercise the heart won't respirate properly..
High blood pressure can cause cardiovascular diseases and certain dysfunctions.
If doctor and patient cooperate with each other then exercise can be beneficial even in old age.
A detailed report has been published in the Journal of the  American Medical Association.
Indian Army Chief Declares Peace with Pakistan
The Indian Army chief, Gen. Depak Kapoor, said that there is very little chance of war with Pakistan. "However, we are ready to protect our national interests at any cost," he said.
General Kapoor feels that despite international pressure, terrorist networks still exist and are active on Pakistani soil.
He was talking with journalists in Sri Nagar.
The Indian Army chief is on a one-day visit to the Kashmir Valley to observe the activities of the armed forces on the borders.
He was asked to comment about Pakistan's rejection of Indian evidence about Mumbai Attacks.
Gen. Kapoor said that political leadership is responsible for dealing with issues relevant to peace or war.
There are many types of common riots and protests in Pakistan.  He also reported there would be a tremendous battle between India and Pakistan.  Pakistan has aimed to weaken the Indian Army.
It is also reported that there are about 700-800 militants within Kashmir, of which about 50% are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor has reported that there is some improvement in the K.I.K. atmosphere. He has also said that Pakistan has increased their military efforts in the Pakistan-dependent region of Kashmir. They have also strengthened their army camps at the borders.
He has also reported that he has increased the number of army troups in Indian Dependent Kashmir. He has clearly notice from their actions that there cannot be any compromise with regard to the protection of the country.
Oh God, please accept our prayers.  Please prove Barack Obama to be good for this world.
It is evident from the present situation that there are slight chances of getting a positive response. Still we will wait and see to what extent the Pakistan-American Relationship changes and what benefit it can give to us.
What inspiration does Obama give to this world with regard to Martin Luther king's dreams and ambitions?
Obama, whose name is partially Hussein, is going to take the Oath as an American Leader.  He is going to be a protector of the country and of it's history.
Not only for the sake of their community, but also for all of those who have supported him with their heart and soul.
This test will happen on the extreme white paper.it is not easy for him to write on the blue paper whole-heartedly that he would rule the country with justice.
Here, South Asia, especially Muslims who have expectations from them, should remember that he has been elected as the president of America. And Obama should remember that the American president is actually the president of the entire world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th president of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have to have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, so this will be a victory for people who support him.
What will be its effect on South Asia, and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change affect the relationship between America and Pakistan?

Dear, whether it is Obama or someone else, the decision of the policy of the entire world is done by the Jewish lobby of  billionaires, influencing powerful people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts, the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is obvious to everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat that had a regular Army and Law.
He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a  pact.
However, it is matter of sorrow that our government treated Swat like a step-mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government by the ruler of Swat.
No interest was taken in the building and development works.
The girls who are getting educations today are much fewer than those who used to get educated in the previous era.
In the Frontier Province there is a continuous targeting of educational institutions by the Taliban.
The largest number of schools destroyed has been in the district of Swat, and the majority of those are girls schools.
In addition to this, the Taliban has imposed a ban on girls' education.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.
What do you think the goal of the Taliban is by wanting to end the education of women?
Why can the Government not stop these unlawful acts?
What efforts to you think the Government should make?
The question is, what are the benefits for ISI and Pakistani agencies?
Now, the people of Swat understand the game:  The military is there to support the Taliban, not to kill them, for how is it possible that 5 schools can be blown up in Karfuo, and people slaughtered and hanged in the street?
When there is no government authority left, how can the government stop these unlawful acts?
Next the question arises that with all the advance technology, destructive weapons, and an effective spy system, why is the Taliban still not in control?
The answer is they have the hand of some secret power, which is why their weapons never run out and they are never arrested.
The conclusion is that the Taliban, with their deeds, are making the work easier for world control.
The war in Afghanistan has been ongoing for the past 15 years.
ISI was controlling Taliban while it's opponent, the North Coalition, was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Suddenly, the situation changed and the Taliban began to act.
ISI was also offered American fundsing, so past friends became enemies.
Now the situation is that this war continues, but still helping in Pakistan are Iran, India and Russia.
Human will keep making mistakes until a feeling of what is right and wrong emerges.
For example, a thief will still steal until he believes stealing is a curse and there is punishment for it; until he fears from God, then that Human will steal.
Likewise, unless Israel inderstand it is wrong for it to drain the blood of innocents, and that there will be  punishment for this, it will keep playing Holi with the innocent blood of Gaza.
Respects!
The question is whether war and terrorism are solutions to the problem?
If not, then what is the solution of the problems?
The truth is that war does not solve the problem, but instead makes it more difficult.
Falastin, Afghanistan and Iraq should learn from the efforts of Nelson Mandela in South Africa to make their movements success.
That mean there should be behaver and politics efforts in more then force.
The participating of Kashmirian public in election tells that they accepted this view.
This is the third week of Israel's attacks on Gaza, and the dead total about 1000.
The war could not be stopped with the efforts of ambassadors until this time.
And according to a guess 9000 Falatinis have been left their homes and gone to save places after the attacks  starting in December.
Charitable organizations blame Israel for failing to care for the mental and emotional problems caused to Palistinian children.
What do you say?
Is this the way it should be?
How is long term peace possible in Gaza?

Give a chance to the Taliban.
Basit, Peshawar.
Wake up! If the Taliban will perform a real Jihad, then who will sacrifice innocent people?
who burnt out girls schools?
If kidnap for ransom, or not getting ransom so who will hang people on the pole by called them American spy?
The Taliban has done more damage to Islam than any other nation or religio.
Pashtoon Roar
Kohat, Pakistan.
If the Muslim world were to threaten or even actually attack Israel, there would be consequences from America, Israel's long-term world partner.
Then, a true cease-fire would be observed.
But what should we do about the cowardice of the Muslim rulers?
Someone should ask the Ahmadi Nejad to be the first to attack as he is popular for his bravery.
The struggle for peace and human rights is not the sole responsibility of Arabs or the Muslim world. It is the duty of the whole world to raise their voices against cruelty.
This sad incident is the worst crime committed by Bush.
In India and Pakistan, the financial corruption increases at the end of fiscal year. Similarly, the Bush administration has permitted Israel to do what it wants.
On one hand, America demands the cease-fire.
On the other hand, the United Nations is passing resolution after resolution but action-wise neither have done anything. There is only one meaning of this, and that is that even the United Nations is openly in favor of destroying the Muslims.
All Muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the United Nations, and should establish their own global organization.
We have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations are seen, but the harm is only done to the Muslims.
What is the use of these vain efforts if the BBC does not want to publish anything?
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically of Muslims, is spilled, the monster of unbiasedness gets onto BBC's back.
It considers itself the standard bearer of truth.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments.
from Muslims
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, while you stay among Muslims, call yourselves Muslims and cause Muslims..
[syja786]
For a long time on BBC forums, sometimes suicide bombing and terrorism in India was used to target a certain sect.
The favorite word of these Anti-Islamic discussions was Extremism.
You can get a very good idea about who an extremist is from the above discussion in which writing against Iran was almost considered blasphemy.
When will our muslims understand that the Anti-Christ can not be fought with swords.
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what can one do other than cry?
But the basic fault is that by naming the source of this turmoil and massacre Jihad, we try to blacken the beautiful face of Islam.
When the majority of Palestinians accepted the existence of Israel, then why did Hammas need to fire those rockets on Israel and conduct suicide attacks?
The attitude of both sides is against humanity.
The role of the UN and the USA was again seen as favoring the injustice of Israel.
May Allah give the muslim nation the understanding of becoming  united. Amen!
As a matter of fact,think about giving Noble Prise to terrorists for carrying out this painful terrorist activity, as a campaign against terrorism, eventually the actual work is being done by them.
Otherwise, is it possible to carry out terrorist activity on such a massive scale without the assistance of Chiefs,when everyone knows who are pulling their strings.
In such a situation it can be termed as high handedness "Do what ever you can".
The strong men first, it beats over the head but do not let one cry.
The Arab rulers are giving medicines for the injured, funeral clothings for the dead and money and they are asking
Should the Israelis continue the attacks?
The actual problem is that the rulers of Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia are dreaming, undutiful, and unaware. They have neither the army nor defense plans. They just think that by providing aid they have fulfilled their duty.
They should immediately take practical steps against Israel.
such as cutting the oil supply to European countries and America.
Regards to all brothers and sisters.
I think asking Hamas to give up their struggle for the sake of peace is unfair to millions of widows and orphans. It negates their struggle entirely.
If the  Pharaoh-ism of US and Israel is on the rise then Moses will come to counter them because every Pharaoh has a Moses.  The American and Israeli actions are producing suicide bombers among Muslims.
Power has affected their ability to think and understand.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Now Hamas and Israel should cease fire to stop bloodshed.
Mohammad Sarfraz, Paris, France
Rightly said.
Suppose Hamas is on the right path and struggling against cruelty for the sake of God's will, they should know that an act of goodness does not remain good if it causes harm to others.
Love for humanity is the precondition for earning God's and his prophet's love.
It would seem God has said to annihilate all people other than Muslims.
Najeeb-ur-Rahman Psycho *Lahore* [Pakian]
No! It is not decreed to annihilate, but it is decreed to invite people to Islam.
But for people who conspire against the religion, it is decreed to do Jihad against them.
One should fight with them until they finish their conspiracies, but this certainly does not mean that they can wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the consequence of a murder of children is disaster.
But I say to my friends that yesterday Israelis did not have a roof over their heads and today they are so strong that they do not listen to anyone because all Jews are one.
They do not have Shiite nor Sunni, all are just Jews, and they have succeeded in every field and made everything.
Contrary to this, what is the condition of 55 Islamic Countries?
They are lagging in every field, and now the condition is such that they are so helpless that enemies are killing them and they are waiting for their death.
The point is that all Muslim countries should get together and should make a plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better action plan than this, to accept Israel and to learn modern science and developmental ways from it, and allow the world to live in peace and serenity.
Muslims have a lot of land and resources.
The need is for proper utilisation.
First, the part that hurts the most is there could not be unity between Hamas and Al-Fath.
Great leader like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were systematically killed to weaken the brave nation of the only region which is still fighting for Masjid Aqsa, and this was not possible as long as Yasin and Arafat were in the way.
The world is watching how Palestine is getting scattered, second by second, after the death of these two leaders.
And how the Jewish lobby is increasing its reach, second by second.
In 1974, Pakistan had a Prime Minister of such global credentials that for the first time in the history of the country, he gathered all the Muslims leaders, with a 100% attendance, under a single roof.
Today, on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task for the people to pledge to keep unity within their ranks.
Also, while eradicating the differences between other Muslims,  its (The formation of Islamic common wealth) mission will be carried forward
It is a monster that has gripped Palestine for half a century.
This monster has many faces.
Many times this monster criticizes itself from a different mouth, to divert the attention of the world.
Its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This monster is most unhappy with Islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through Islam, and the history of Practical Islam that Islam has put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
Bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since the 27th of December.
More than 300 Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
After the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
Through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
However, Israeli officials claim that they will continue their action in Gaza until they are convinced that Israel will be safe from rocket attacks.
In your opinion, is the statement by Israel, that this is an Israeli struggle for safety acceptable?
In this situation, is the global brotherhood doing its job?
Can this inhumane action have a direct relation with the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can there be any expectation of improvement in the Middle East situation, after the newly elected president Barack Obama takes office?

Zaheer Chughtai
In this art now a days; the Pakistani electronic and print media, especially some Urdu newspapers and columnists, are no more behind anyone who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism, or in the ""grudge of Muavia"" written on them.
Has said that the United Nations, which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of it's mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. How long will this hypocrisy continue?
Why is so much oppression being done on the Muslims? If country like America stop supporting these Jews, then Allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support, and then see what kind of life they get.
The just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.
In the words of a poet
Oppression is oppression, the more it's done the more it is erased.
Blood is blood, the more it falls, the more it gathers.
Now who can tell who did terrorism?
Is all this not included in terrorism? Why does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocents not red?
And why is there no one to send a mourning message from anywhere?
I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.
I see dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood. How shall we condemn? I can not find words!
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims. On one side people are being killed in India so the rest of the world comes over to Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations that we will do it ourselves!
On the other side, Israel is killing generations of Muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent. This is unbearable!
There is delay but not ever in the house of God. Only then will this darkness shed.
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Concerning elections, the rulers should do such things to gain people's support. There is no doubt about this especially when countries like Israel exist. Stop talking about Barrack Obama. History is a witness that no American leader has gone against this policy. They will not do it. A regime, whether black or white, is a regime.
The debate going on in the forum makes it clear that every one is sad on Benazir's death. As a politician, one can not ignore her mistakes.
This talk requires debate on whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was so dear, then  why was it left in 10 year dictatorship of Musharaf until American clearance and the deal?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when people affected by dictatorship needed her. Unfortunately she came to Pakistan when she was assured by the government that she will be freed from trails.
There is no one remaining to say about the criticism and accusations of a historical personality.
Sana Khan
Some things should be ignored because nothing can be done about them.

Ladies and gentlemen probably you will understand My ideas because you have not only read history of Pakistan  but you have also read about Sir in four friendly countries and seven others.

How bloody is our Nation and in our parties excitement while writing the Epode they will be blind but now every historic people is trying to pinpoint an accusation and criticize the judious, but on this there is no one is tell any thing
We have achieved lot of success.
Sana Khan
Few things can be avoided by thinking that nothing can be done. For this in the same  as if we put books on a donkey. He will not become a professor.
If after the attack on Mumbai there is a problem between Pakistan and India, they still have to continue their regular activities.
If we talk about war then on both sides there will be a loss of human life.
India is saying that the person arrested at the time of the Mumbai attack is a Pakistan citizen and he has written a letter in Urdu and sent it to Pakistan. But India has said after arresting him that he is an engineer, but after that they have proved that he is just a fourth standard pass, a point to be observed.
First of all, to Mr bhana and all western friends of this forum, a happy Christmas.
Colleagues of the forum: Mr. Psycho, A Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahedah Akram and to all Adaab (Salaam, Greeting)
We do not want the flames of war, we want the flowers of peace.
War in itself is a problem.
What problems can war solve?
It will give fire and blood today.
It will give hunger and need tomorrow.
Therefore, O intelligent people,
If war keeps getting postponed, it's better.
In your and our porch,
If the candle keeps burning, it's better.
Indo-American relations have now gotten quite deep, and India knows with certainty, that America will openly betray Pakistan when the time comes.
This is also the old history of America.
In case of an Indian attack, America would make its goals and the expense would be on India as well.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation or ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied, even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
This is the Islamic history.
Even before this resolution, the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it more clever than effective and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction, the world community has relaxed its' pressure now.
While ignoring India's unnecessary bobbery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a "Side Effect" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
There are no two opinions over this that it is a heinous act.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past year?
How many Taliban are killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday?
I appeal to the I.S.I, that for God's sake, stop monitoring the Taliban and let us live in peace in our heavenly hometown Sawat.
And stop this phony operation.
The day is not far when a resolution about Pakistan's military intervention will be passed by United Nations, just like the bill which was passed against Jamat-ud-Dawah.
Riaz Ahmad Farooqi
The extremists of our country and their supporters are constantly providing all the evidence and justification required for the instigation of action against them.  God forbid that the day when such a resolution is passed, in all likelihood not a single voice will be raised in the United Nations in our favor.
And supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.
We are not aware and familiar with the character and achievements of Pir Sami-ullah and what his activities were.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
Like the dead bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, Doctor Najeebullah and thousands of other revolutionists have been subjected to dishonor at the hands of the enemy.
They are immortal even after they die.
There is an international game being played here, in which the public is ruled by fear through barbarism and ferociousness.
So that license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will clutch the government.
These acts of so-called Islamic activists in the name of religion should be utterly condemned.
The supporters of extremists can see the injustice of America, but instead of expressing grieve on those dishonest acts they clearly shun them by giving them the name of tribal traditions.
Sometimes by cloaking in tribal traditions, sometimes in the name of Islam, no pious man can give reason for such dishonest acts.
In my view, our Army is associated with theses people.
When these people move from a place, it takes so much time that they can be caught.  There should be time for that, but it's a stretch that they get there on time, even if they are there, they are long gone.
Are they so merciless that they kidnap fifty seventy men?  And our Army stands by like a spectator.
They are servants of Allah and so is our Army.
There is something wrong at the bottom.
Malaiat, in the period of the dictator of the time Zia-u-Lhaq, did not show good characteristics of sympathies of Allah, but there is various tortures in the name of religion and more in his writing: "What will be done after death."
And such persons use this fear as a way to get the world's respect.
Speakers                                                                                                                                                              ""preachers""
You frighten the world with the fires of Hell.
You became the image of fright.
It is wondered then where it is said that this cannot be a Muslim action.
We ourselves do not know this history or cover it for any purpose.


Was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
Without accepting reality, neither can their motives be understood nor can corrections be made.
O' BBC please stop this dual-headed policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
Please show some modesty. A human was pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office?
the success of Operation Sherdil and Operation Lion Heart across the border depends on who is in the favor of public opinion.
This is an act of American and Pakistani agencies and Peer.  Sahab is a victim of this conspiracy.
All discussions on this forum will now be anti-Taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined Taliban and they are doing what they can to change the public opinion.
I would like to ask only this. What were the soldiers doing when the corpse was kept hanging throughout the day? Were they sitting there to aim only at the common people? It is said that Taliban hideouts were bombed and a woman and two kids were killed when a house was attacked.
Why? Didn't they know about this tragedy?
Were they leisurely having fun?
Let me make a request to you. For God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler who watches over all of us.
The question raised by the BBC is substandard; I could only feel pity for the writers. For instance, nobody asked this: What were the 3000 soldiers camping at Swat doing?
The army's assistants were hanging the bodies of those who resisted the Taliban on poles.
The crimes committed against the commoners by the Pakistani soldiers have been done. But it is not right that the media, including the BBC, has concealed that fact from the world.
The Pakistani soldiers are playing drama.
Every child in Swat whispers that it is a bloody drama.
Stop this drama for God's sake!
These Taliban members have destroyed the image of Muslims.
If the real Muslims do not accept Taliban as Muslims, then why do they get a refuge in thier places?
The ones who are shameless and don't do hard work and labor take arms in their hands and join their group.
Islam doesn't spread through swords and guns.
Have shame.
It's baseless has no roots in any religion nor in family customs.
All media including the BBC show different views on Taliban and tribals.
Infact nobody knows the actual situation except us, becuase we are the natives.
(  sorry was pretty hard to translate)
This move has shamed all Muslims.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is the Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that the current leadership will remove this cancer.
After the Mumbai incident, India said that extremists were behind the attacks.
Pakistan rejected the accusations and said that it will help India in investigating the attacks in every possible way.
India said that it has given a list to Pakistan of 20 suspected extremists wanted by India.
Now Pakistan has said that included in the list is Jaish-e-Muhammad's Molana Azhar Masood, who is not in custody and the government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before that the president of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari rejected the view that western spy agencies and the Indian government had provided evidence related to the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari has said that it has not been proven that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani.
At that time, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that relations with India would not improve as long as its land was being used to harbor terrorists.
And in the latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should sports be affected due to these political events?
What future do you see for the relationship between India and Pakistan?
Neither America nor India could break Pakistan.
Pakistan could only be broken by the Pakistanis themselves.
What do you expect after such regionalism, communalism. and vandalism?
Even Jinnah did not do good for the Muslims of India. Time has proved this.
Yasmin, Chicago
If we had kept working on the vision of Jinnah, destroying the cancer of communalism, then regionalism and vandalism would not have spread in Pakistan, and the Muslims of India would not have been treated poorly.
It is our mistake that we have not produced a leader of his caliber.
If only we could pay respect to our heroes.
This region has great potential.
God knows when this region will learn its lesson. Its unity will bring prosperity.
Both countries have extremist forces like Taliban, Shiv Sena and RSS etc... These extremist forces are enemies of regional peace.
The imperial powers do not want peace and stability in this region. They are controlling these countries like puppets.
Can you imagine the international influence of Pakistan, China and India, if they were united?
Pakistan is under the occupation of corrupt and opportunist leaders.
May God protect our country, Pakistan.
But being Pakistanians we should not neglect the realities on the ground. American forces have been deployed very near to our border with Afghanistan.
Besides this, the situation in the country doesnt seem to be stable, like in the NWFP, Baluchistan and Sindh, and the problems in Karachi are also evident.
In this atmosphere, we need a leader that can unite the people of this country.
O God please show us some mercy.
I believe we have no other option but to go to war one last time.
Enough is enough.
It's now or never.
These fraudulent dialogues and pointless meetings are not the solution to the problem.
Neither is committing small scale terrorist acts in each others territories.
After all, it was only after waging the Second World War that Europe managed to sort its problems out.
Were it not for this World War, they'd still be arguing and nagging at each other over small things.
Almost all of our political parties are unified in the idea that terrorism and sectarian violence shall be eradicated from the country.
However, our own military leadership does not seem to be sincere in this assertion. On one side, Europe and America are assured that the military is sincere in achieving a terror-free state, but on the other hand, the military aids the Taliban covertly.
Now we have to think and define our path and select one to focus on. Thank you.
There is no doubt that the elements of Jamat-ud-dawa include a majority which belongs to Lashkar-e-Taiba, a banned organization which is now established and operating with a new name: Jamat-ud-dawa Pakistan.
However, after more focus was diverted towards humanitarian activities on India's strong request, the United Nations has also banned it. The government of Pakistan has also implemented a crackdown on this organization.
In my opinion, if these Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and focus on religion and humanitarian assistance, then it is much better.
The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan which have used the name of Jihad to induct and nurture professional killers, criminals and their molana's, are the same people who called Pakistan 'Plaeedistan' meaning un clean land. These are the people who make a bad name for Pakistan.
Now, they are trying their best to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they aren't even close to being a Muslim. In fact, they deserve to be called animals or barbarians.
Pakistani security will remain at risk until these extremists are eradicated from the country.
Should we still believe that the innocent people will be charged with rules and regulation?
In this furious world the job is war, their work is only to kill.
With this news my heart is broken.
What type of world is this in which it is very difficult to follow the preachings of Allah's Islam.
Non-Muslim can kill Muslims, but when Muslims try to take revenge then all non-Muslims along with the whole world think that Islamic preaching is done with Hafiz Sayeed.
India is very upset about the attack on Mumbai.
Citizens of Pakistan have created the misunderstanding between the two countries and in the coming days the situation will worsen.
India always blames the Pakistani terror group.
The up coming problems on the taluk ,has  been stoped.
The Indian security centers have blamed them for the attack on Mumbai, saying the Lashkar-e-tayab is responsible.
In this case, the name Jamat-ud-Dawa has popped up many times.
This is the first time that relationship between both the countries has worsened due to terrorist activity in India.
In December 2001, after the attacks on the Indian Parliament, these two neighbors were on the brink of war.
After that, in 2002, Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
Now Security analysts say Jamat-ud-Dawais is, in reality, the new face of Lashker-e-Tayyaba. Restrictions on the party are being requested.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan conduct decisive operations against extreme activists on its land?
By banning Jamat-ud-Dawa, can  current Pak-India crisis be over?
And how important is it to close down the armed groups to keep constant peace between both countries?
The Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all, what proof does the Security Council have to decide this so quickly?
Will the Peace Council ever show any alertness against the Muslims?
When the accuser is lazy the witness is active.
If see; India itself has become one useless realm.
Whose intelligence, army and other security officials have become useless, who for 72 hours has danced the dance of mole with terrorists and India is cheating the world by blaming Pakistan over its uselessness.
If one disbeliever dies then the whole world knows about it- why is this double accuracy?
To the dear nation of one nonpolitical, religious, farming organization
Farqaan Farooq, Faisalabad
Until our Prophet(Peace be upon Him), great ancestors and Sufism gave the human beings the love and respect, the Islamic religion was more vast growing and ripening from peace and sparkle.
The Muslims also got promoted in every field.
But when this beautiful Religion rose to the hands of distillation then within the human beings began the difference of religious and disbeliever and the new gateways of pride and prejudice began to open by which the world was unknown before.
Salute, sir, salute happily, but get your work done on your own.
Do not do it because of American pressure.
If India is in difficulty, let them prove it, no?
Why does it not give?
And why do they accuse us of everything?
There are fundamentalist groups and organisations even in India. Why does no one put any restrictions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the whole world?
What is it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What is it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the first Islamic Nuclear State. Is this what the fight is about?
Pakistan is on the verge of breaking up.
Kamranhassan, ABU DHABI
You are right, and circumstances are supporting your argument.
Now even American magazines are publishing new maps of Pakistan. These sanctions are the part of greater game plan.
Gradually, the United States is strengthening its grip on Pakistan.
In this situation, if we don't become a united nation, then the history of Bangladesh's creation will be repeated.
Terrorists attacks should be condemned, whether these are committed in Mumbai, Islamabad or in Philistine.
Terrorists should be uprooted without any discrimination with regard to nationality.
The question arises, why is Pakistan and the rest of world silent on the terror attacks in Pakistan, which killed hundreds of innocent people?
Was the attack on the Marriott not an act of terror?
Then why?
Hale to the adviser for interior Rehman Malik, how brave and bold the gentleman has become.
No image.
not only this, but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under 'someones's pressure'.
Wow, praise to the Almighty!
whether having the ability or not or to say that I don't want.
We, Pakistanis are fighting whose war.
We have our own interests that we shall do our best to protect.
No one has a right to interfere anyone's national affairs.
The colonial system is apparently not there.
If people are sure to have justice or Allies support the importance of free judiciary and give respect to democratic institutes and dont support the dictatorial governments; peace can be achieved in third world countries including Pakistan. But this is not acceptable for allies
Pakistan is always in line with European and American interests.
Pakistan is forced to be so, despite the opposition from the majority of its populace.
This enhances the opposition viewpoint and anti-American sentiment.
If America and its Allies believe in Democracy, they should give up their colonial behavior and leave this region
Pakistan has the ability to arm or disarm.
Security forces searched a camp of Lashkar-i-tayba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
After Mumbai attacks, pressure is being increased on Pakistan to take actions against extreme outfits
India has claimed that the group based in Lashar-i-tayba had a role in the Mumbai attacks.
Condoleezza Rice, American foreign minister asked Pakistani leadership to take practical and transparent actions against those responsible for Mumbai attacks.
He believed the terrorists involved in the Mumbai Attacks were from Pakistan.
Meanwhile, the officials in Peshawar stated that more than fifty trucks have been burned by some unknown armed personnel. These trucks were going to Afghanistan with goods for NATO forces.
This was the second attack on American supplies during the last forty-eight hours.
Meanwhile Pakistani police cracked down a camp of Lashkar i Taiba, a banned outfit. Already many efforts have been made to disarmed the extremists, even money and indemnity was offered.
It is clear from the circumstances that efforts remain unsuccessful to dislodge the armed groups funded by Americans and Saudis during afghan war. It means efforts to restore Pre-80's Pakistan are fruitless.
Question arises, whether Pakistan wants to do so?
Does Pakistan have an ability to do this?
What is your opinion?

I have only one question for the standard-bearers of the world-
If you kill their children, will they come to praise you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill innocent public, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in the negative, then you really need to examine your point of view.
The people were armed when there was the fear that Russia would head towards Pakistan after finishing Afghanistan, and that is why they were supplied arms.
Now, when there is the fear that America will capture Pakistan via Afghanistan,as the American president  mentioned in his presidential address, why should we disarm them now?
Only so that after defeating the American or Indian army, it does not have to face any resistance from the public?
Yes, if any of them are guilty of being involved in any destructive work, Pakistan can take action against them alone.
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
Another question is that were these terrorists supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the present terrorism is in no way connected to it.
It must be remembered that Hafiz Saeed is the first 'Jehadi leader' who called the Taliban actions 'mischief'.
I am sure that the Taliban effect is an inseparable result of American plans. Hence, every person who can stand in the way of the Taliban must be removed.
Despite the support of the whole nation, the fact that Zardari took action against the Lashkar is a clear sign of frigid and sycophant nature.
To stop the project that is running on Saudi-American funding, they must be requested themselves to regather, for God's sake, the filth that has polluted our society.
we will protest against them that in which ethical way America and Saudia has distributed dangerous weapons and so called Jihad but actually they have distributed hatred literature and cultural virus which has created a human slaughter houses.
After the threat from India to attack Pakistan, the Pakistan military announces that it will pull its forces from the Afghan border and put them towards India. The Taliban also announced that they will take care of the Afghan border, which resulted in chaos in America and it forced India not to go to war with Pakistan.
In this letter all the firepower of American was exposed.
in contrast India has never threatened nor it has the power to attack
The remaining damage is done by the Taliban attacking the American convoy.
This proved that, without the Pakistan military and government support, America is nothing.
Karachi, Pakistan's Main Business and Finance City which is Dubai of all the rural areas
Millions never returned from here, but when the law and order situation in western areas worsens then all the attention is directed towards Karachi.
Now they want to hijack this city.
For the first time, Pathans are called by Pakhtuns, which is making the city's people act like strangers and fight among each other. To be united is a necessity of the time.
One solution to this problem is that either the Urdu speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun speaking people learn Urdu, or better yet, both learn English.
You might think that this is a funny proposal, but does the cause of the conflict not seem funny?
That the cause of extremism be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, I actually shared this proposal many times in my childhood with my friends, which included people from all religious and linguistic groups, but these people used to laugh at me.
At that time, the religious and linguistic hate which was not as lively and strong as they are today were still developing within.
I can never understand what is happening and why.
Are these the signs of the Day of Judgement?
For what crime are innocent people being killed?
The reasons are in front of everybody, those who want to break up Pakistan are the active ones and those who do such things have neither religion nor country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns.
Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir mean that is what is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
At the height of the Mumbai attacks, the fact that the efforts to cause mischief on linguistic and racial lines in Karachi failed is proof that those politicians working on racial parole have resigned from their jobs.
The taking of the lives of innocent Pushtu speaking laborers, and the Indian warnings have awakened the sleeping Pakistani feelings from Karachi to Khyber.
The identical country loving reaction of all the political, religious, linguistic and national parties has not only taught India the manners of diplomacy, but it has also given the American policy makers a chance to think again.
The responsible parties for the worsening situation in Karachi are the United and the ANP. The government is taking sides.
The government can control the situation in one hour, but it is purposely allowing it to grow.
The police and rangers are avoiding action because of the pressure on them by political parties.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
These kinds of situations will happen until political pressure stays on the management. Allah keep Pakistan safe.
In my opinion, they are the biggest terrorists.
Of course there are external powers active in this, but no one knows who they are.
The saddest part is if this kind of situation occurred in some city in Sarhad, the government would have done something, but if it is not in Sarhad, the government would be so helpless.
The government should intervene here and save one of the country's largest and most important cities.
Otherwise, Pakistan will face a serious economic setback.
Even BBC Urdu is too scared to write the truth, although the state of the Pakistani media is even worse.
The complete truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is this that Urdu speaking people should learn Pashto or Pashto speaking people should learn Urdu. It would be even better if everyone learned English.
You will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but don't you think the reason for collision is ridiculous?
Language may be the reason for persecution.
Another story of murder has finally been published in Karachi, which was being dreaded by all the citizens for a long time.
The criminals seize any opportunity to commit a crime. The media are only telling 50% of what actually happened here in 4 days.
I have spent the last three nights sleepless and the fear is still there.
Those who make the people evacuate hotels, those who kill the shoe-makers and the peanut-sellers.
Those who rob and kill at the Super Highway, and cut off the ears of innocent citizens, they are ignorant of the wrath of Allah which will eventually entrap them.
In your opinion, what could be the reasons for this sudden turmoil?
(B.B.C)
Keeping in mind the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in Karachi. It is simple and easy to guess that the turmoil is just due to an unconscious trade of blood.
Obviously if someone infuriates the father, it would not be surprising for the son to react violently.
The blood of the loyalists of Liaqat Ali Khan also belonged to the same place. To eliminate Mr. Psycho's misunderstanding I am writing this verse.
We shall also continue the traditions of our elders.
We made it by sacrificing lives, and will save it by doing the same.
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
It is very disappointing that the whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
See Liaqat Ali Khan, you will find out that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family from Karnal, in Punjab.
Due to his steps for the migrants, today the migrants consider him as one of them.
There is always a reaction to every action.
One can afford on oneself but.
Ejaz Aiwan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the graffiti of real gangsters these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan. They did not face any reaction.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
One Muslim League N was left. Even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to the People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment to the National Assembly and the Senate.
Until now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment are a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why  no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part. They will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft and that the government speaker did not take any action.
MQM the government, Muslim League N in the opposition and Muslim League Q was the party who passed 17th amendment so how is it possible that these parties will be sincere in finishing the 17th amendment.
This is called getting credit for nothing.
The People's party is not in a hurry about finishing the 17th Amendment.
How can someone think of cutting their own hands?
The 17th Amendment will not be canceled until Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of the majority in our survey and it is also true.
If the 17th Amendment was discarded then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf. Because with being the president, he is also the chairman of the People's Party.
The 17th Amendment will not be valid until he is the president.
In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to bid Zardari farewell from the presidential house.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
Most of the elders in our family belonged to the working class.
During our childhood when our uncles did their work, we prayed to Allah to protect us from physical labor.
To avoid this, we wrote to the editor of monthly Amroz to ask him what to do after matriculation so that we would not have to do physical labor.
The editor wrote in reply that we should become a doctor or engineer and study these courses.
We were inclined towards engineering and in matriculation we studied Technical drawing instead of Biology.
But at the time of admissions in FSc, the elder brother forced us to study medical in FSc.
We hardly studied biology for a month before we started studying math.
In order to avoid physical labor, we became engineers and we are in a better position than many friends in our family. We thank Allah for it.
We remembered this when with our two young sons we were trying to tear out old carpets.
It had been not even half an hour that we were working when the small son said, "Daddy, it seems that I am not born for this job."
We said, "If so, study well like us and build up your body".
The son started saying, "I am studying already and will study more but this work is not done by me".
Anyhow, us three managed to complete the work within three hours and returned home.
The meaning of saying this is that if a man decides on one destiny then whatever comes afterward will not stop him to accomplish his destination.
Yes and if you don't really know what you have to do, then Allah is the only protector for you.
There is a saying that we should never speak ill of the dead, but what to do, when at the first anniversary of Benazir's death, we only see bad in her.
Benazeer for her own benefit forwarded to India the Sikhs' army, who were going to fight the war of independence. On one side the independent movement of the Sikhs collapsed and on the other side gave chance for India to concentrate on Kashmir after pushing down the Punjab movement.
Distraction from the leadership of Benazeer and Nawaz Sharif have pushed the country to many years backwards.
During exile, Benazir continued on keeping the series beneficiary information of Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
During the rule of Benazir, she gave her husband the freedom to make as much money as possible, which is why he is known as Mr. Ten Percent.
During Benazirs' rule, her brother was killed, but the murderers are still safe from any punishment.
Besides being a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for womens' rights.
Just as Benazir did her politics over her father's dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came into power twice, but she could not punish the culprits of her father's political murder, as even she couldn't register a case against them.
It has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us, but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
What should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated December 16 as a day for education and take such measures that this kind of incident doesn't take place again.
On this day we could send greetings to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to us again.
The rulers should reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Biharis trapped in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines.
If only East and West Pakistan could be one together just as East and West Germany were united once again.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem likely to be granted in the near future.
It was announced in the news today that the Governor of the American State Illinois had been arrested on corruption charges.
When the State Congress started getting ready to remove him from the position of governor as soon as possible, there was one American companion of ours who keeps a close watch on the circumstances of Pakistan, who boastfully claimed to us that this is what we call democracy.
In America, even the higher level people are not above the law.
And the other is your country, Pakistan, where even the president was chosen after the corruption charges against him were dropped.
My vein of loyalty throbbed and I said what is the big deal if a governor was arrested in America? In Pakistan, once the prime minister was arrested and hanged overnight, and another time sent into exile.
Tell me, when did this happen in America?
In Pakistan, those who broke the law were sent out of the presidential palace with a guard of honor. Tell me when this happened in America.
The Chief Justice of Pakistan was removed in such a manner, that despite having public support, he could not be replaced until now. Has this happened in America?
In Pakistan, a fake-degree holder was made the Minister of Health. Did this happen in America?
Hearing this, the American laughed until he was tired and accepted defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded on all four sides by Americans.
It seems from his smile that
He thinks that America is with his government. He is forgetting that one year ago, they were with Pervez Musharraf.
Thus psychotherapy gained popularity.
Whether there is madness in method, or method in madness, there is certainly a method in dealing with madness.
That said, mental health care has come a long way from merely addressing dementia to dealing with problems such as stress, depression, anxiety and relationship problems.
When she finished her MA in counseling psychology from Columbia university.
The center offers support services for depression, anxiety, stress, learning problems, and personality deficiencies.
Material problems and workplace issues.
It also offers employee assistance programs for corporates.
There are enough opportunities in the fields of counseling and psychotherapy.
Traditionally both roles were played by psychiatrists, who not only counseled patients, but prescribed them drugs.
Research has revealed that there are conditions which can be cured without medication.
Instead of using power, the government should find out the real causes of the problem.
Fazalullah and the Taliban will dissolve into nothingness if the root causes are terminated.
The Shariat bill suggested by the ANP administration will, to a great extent, bring a solution for the problems in Swat.
In addition to the observance of the Shariat law, the administration will take care of the well being of the people.
The actions of General Musharaf led us to believe that we had been freed from the unqualified politicians of the land but, his ambition for more power changed everything.
How high expectations there were! He lost all hopes in ""war and terror"".
Hopes of taking actions were lost.
It seemed he understood that the end of his reign was imminent along with the end of Bush administration. As a result, thieves were recruited to power centers.
General Musharaf was in a position to control the army, but the present administration doesn't know what is happening.
The army could not put down the terror in Baajodoh and Swat. The commoners are subjected to "bombardments and enmity", creating great loss to lives and properties, and launching them into psychological disorder.
In Swat, the strongly affected part of Sarhad state, despite the continuity of military action for over one year, the situation is still going from bad to worse.
On one hand, the government is reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly. On the other hand, the Taliban's illegal radio FM channel is having much more influence in the region.
On the third side, the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region.
During the attacks by security forces there were claims the fundamentalists were destroyed bombing from gun ship helicopters and cannon houses. Despite this damage, the Taliban only became more powerful. According to one estimation, their control over Swat increased that much more.
On the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat, but on the other hand the Taliban is stronger.
Who are stuck in between? The poor civilians.
It is said in Swat, that someone asked what kind of people the Taliban were, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of Allah and the religion'.
Then he asked how the army was, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country'.
Finally, he asked who the enemies of the religion and the country were. He received the answer, "We civilians are."
I am wondering how the Pakistani Army will fight the Indian Army, when they couldn't control a small faction of the Taliban.
They could not track down Taliban's illegally operated FM channel, which in my opinion is very easy.
But still, FM was spreading hatred in full swing.
The boys schools are being destroyed after the girls schools.
A curfew is imposed so that Talibans can move around easily.
Tonight eight trucks entered the suburbs of Mingora during curfew and created bunkers.
The question is that how could they reach there during curfew?
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house and salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, someone tell this army to protect the helpless people of Sawat from the Taliban and prove that the Pakistan army can overcome any enemy.
He says that most of the blood is spilled in the name of religion. Tell me, if there was no religion, would blood not have spilled?
Punjabi, Pathan, White and Blank, Mehsood and other tribes, are these the products of religion?
No, not at all. A religion teaches that there is no white and no black, there is no Punjabi and no immigrants. If there was no religion, then humanity would have destroyed one another in the battle of black and white.
The religion only teaches the man how to be disciplined and mannered. Religion only shows the man that he has not come by himself instead he has been created by the Supreme Power God and He has sent you in this world to lead a life as per His orders.
Being a Muslim, I am very sure that Islam is a complete religion  and moreover it is a true religion.
Even after the time I acquired the luxuries in London, I continued to call up my relatives every morning to find out about their good and bad events. Even though my relatives never bothered to call me ever in my life, I still  continued to do so. But when I felt that my relatives didn't even like my calling them, I stopped making calls to them.
Even I have felt the same here since I have spent two years in France.
Why do people still only  expect us to call them Patna?
Regarding Iraq, within a few hours there would be an Army sent for the "peace" in Darfar. This is not a problem for them.
The action after the Mumbai Blasts and the security in the area are a matter of few hours.
There are discussions and opinions on the matter where there are more risk to death in the areas of Mumbai through any sources.
Hey you, the Protectors and leaders of the peaceful world, life is being ended here only in the discussions.
Is it really being waited to be diminished?
so that any again no aggrieved could even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights.
when a father is running, carrying his beloved son's dead body, even then, your hearts don't pinch you with pain?
If not, then you don't even deserve to be called a human being.
You become a black mottle over the name of humanity.
So at least this has been proven that this region has also been a homeland for Jews for centuries.
Ideally, these two nations should have lived in harmony, but since their strings are in Western and Arab hands, so without their will peace can not prevail in this region.
Now even Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
Even if the Israeli operation stops temporarily, it will start again any moment after any incident.
BBC's own country has its interests related to America and Israel and this is why while taking cover of enlightened moderation, it has started a series of blogs on Jewism and this creates biased propaganda.
BBC is only completing a formality, and its goal and intent is to gather well wishes.
I request the moderator to publish this comment from Fidwi, so that some truth may still remain on BBC.
Thank You.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How could I not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time, including Derah Gahzi Khan, summer showers are taking place throughout the country.
This is a poem about climate, enjoy the sweet rain as you read it.
It rains just because of you.
Whenever it rains it is Spring.
Whatever comes to a standstill is tranquility.
Sometimes it comes for no reason.
Often it spreads wide at night.
Often the rain comes noisily, and often it is silent
It rains because of you
Whatever memory, whatever night
A suppressed music!
Sometimes, he put it out.
Sometimes, he lit himself up.
Sometimes, every drop carries sorrow.
These rains are quite like you
All these leaders are about to run holding a very sensitive case. Little do they care if the country survives or not.
The people should be selling their possessions or wiping the temples clean with lemon peels.
Like our leaders, our media is corrupted as well.
Its sole purpose is to extract money from the government.
And the people are oblivious about this.
An odd incident took place yesterday at noon.
Police are running here and there, but don't ask about illegal parking.
What's more, NYPD traffic was not able to look at illegally parked vehicles.
Something like this happened, when a plane of US Air really became a ship and landed in the Hudson river.
We only know that terrorists are of the descendants of geese.
Yesterday was perhaps historically cold in New York.
The temperature does not fall this much.
Even my jaw started hurting from my half an hour walk outside.
Imagine how the people who jumped from the plane into the river would have felt.
There was so much happiness that all the people were safe.
And it was sad that the company's plane sunk during this financial crisis.
I went by West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, during my one-hour trip the way had opened at least a bit, so I was able to use the 56th street exit.
I had not taken the previous two exits, seeing the lines of traffic there.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, congratulations. Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women.

Sarah: I have slaughtered two chickens. How I did it, Jahanzeb has already mentioned.
Besides this, there is no other way.

For no reason, we thought that the Taliban group from Sawat was non-religious, who were only against female education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
Like the majority of the ideas, this was not proven right. According to CNN news, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a boys school with gunpowder.
Swat: The Taliban has destroyed a boys' school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First".  I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation of the Taliban being against girls education is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Amen, Amen.
Masha Allah, up until now 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom, among Muslims, of fixing marriages before birth, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement made by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See the picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
Some days go, a girl's marriage with a dog become fresh.
I see that now.
Humanity is rare in the 21st century.
It is the age of the computer. The computer occupies a place in every walk of life.
Many people have objections to the interference of computers in financial matters.
Although credit card users have facility but their personal life is under more control of law enforcement agencies.
Now the record of financial matters can easily be tracked by using credit cards.
In the future, when usage of currency decreases, its importance will increase.
In the crime world, the risk is not taken to rob banks. Now credit card information is stolen.
Similarly friends are also made through computers.
Social networking sites such as Orkut, Facebook and Myspace have achieved an initial level of acceptance.
But do you not think that the more we are following these social networking sites, the we interact with people in real life?
Also consider match-making websites, where your preferences are matched to a list of people with similar desires as you.
Can you lead a life with a person who is just like you?
I can not. That is why a spouse is called the better half.
He/she will help eliminate my faults.
Perhaps I have achieved some small degree of wisdom.
I used to believe everything my elders said.
Consequently, I thought that my father knew the answer to every question on earth.
I used to get laughed at a lot for this.
But only that saying seemed true which could be possible.
The lie caused such an irritation but what was the reason to lie.
Bore loss on that saying even at this age
So it is my effort to say lie the very least.
Do not misguide someone by lying and attaching Allah's name to said lie.
and Allah willing say only when there is pray to Allah that work completes.
Remaining Allah knows better the state of intention.
This is a disgusting problem that results from a distancing from religion.
According to law of both Pakistan and our religion, minor children should stay with their mother.
Their expense is due to their father and father can meet with children.
Then when the child comes of age he can stay with whomever he wishes.
You rightly mentioned that the actual problem is that of the relatives who mislead.
Possessiveness is present in all of our actions.
Because of this, there will be new shareholders in the father's property born, and they will go against him. Otherwise his fathers action is commendable.
These restrictions have caused social evils, even in our marriages.
The concept of the marriage of a divorced woman or a widow has become obscure.
Wasteful ideologies and baseless traditions have made the family structure a mess.
Why is it In our society, if the spouse of a 50-55 year person passes away,  they not looked at in a nice manner?
There is a Pakistani uncle whose wife passed away 10-12 years ago near us.  Now after marrying off all his children he has married a widow, so even his children have gone against him.
I believe this is his legitimate right. What do you say?
What kind of mentality believes 'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place?'
I believe that this person's children should have thought what is wrong if he married a widow, after he married off all his children?
This widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
The children would definitely have gotten busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
If tomorrow their wives refuse to look after them, when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society, which have been facing for the last 40-50 years.
A wife can accept her husband going around having illicit relations, but she can't stand him having a second wife.
If possible, stop him from doing so, even after death.
She destroys her husband and her own hereafter, and becomes a cause for spreading filthiness in society.
Islam doesn't mean anything; In reality, we like only our culture and traditions.
For instance, keeping girls from gaining an education and fearing marrying the girl of one's choice.
As for your question, the old man was going to the widow's house instead of bringing the widow to his house, so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax (though the stomach of the widow's children would hurt).
In the Indo-Pak subcontinent, Islam was accepted centuries ago, but it could not yet leave its' ignorant mentality and has always kept culture and tradition above Islam.
Thinking of a man's second marriage as an innovation, divorce as a clinical rest, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife, is all a part of this mentality.
What's more, in mimicry of the western countries, we have started to consider piety and veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam is easy, but leaving this mentality is very difficult.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.
Centuries passed with such little writing.

Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes, "I found this secret in my life that if the leader of any army is in the front line then that army will never lose."
But here, the situation is different.
They say that common people are there to die for us and they die as martyrs.
Yet, if a common person dies it should be considered murder.
As Salaamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu (greeting).
Today, as I was returning to my shop after Isha prayer, a man sitting in a car at the circle raised his hand and drew my attention towards him.
I thought this man might have lost his way, or he might want to ask something, so I stopped, and saw his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked whether I could understand Arabic well or not. I said, no problem, tell me what you want.
He started to say that "I have come from Riyadh, to Madinah, but someone has pick-pocketed me, so please help me out." I asked him to excuse me, as such an incident had taken place with me previously, that I had given the person 20 Riyals to buy petrol to reach Riyadh, but he went a little ahead and started to ask somebody else.
I got very angry and scolded him and warned him that I would call the soldiers, so he got very frightened.
Now the situation has become that we Muslims come in cars with our families to beg all day, and gain at least two or three thousand illegally.
Whereas there is a clear Hadith of the Prophet (SAWS) that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand; the lower hand being the begging hand and the upper hand being the giving one.
May Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims. (Amen, Amen.)

Famous singer Adnan Sami's wife reached a police station in Mumbai, accusing him of torturing her.
The police station advised her to contact a court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Giladari gave a complaint against her husband saying that he continuously tortured her.
He treats her in a non-human manner.
Now it has become difficult for her to bear. This is why she has filed a case against him.
The police, instead of filing a case, told her to contact a court, saying that this matter was not one which the police could touch.
In your opinion, is the accusation against Adnan Sami, by his wife proper?
This is not an Indian effort to disgrace Adnan Sami, is it?
Let us know your opinion on this issue.
Adam Sanghad Mehr.
As far as making accusations, anyone can accuse the other.
To become enraged due to defending honor is not sensible.
Whatever be the case between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he left his honorable life and went to India to earn money. Now that fame has fallen around his neck.
This is a result of his own actions.
Washington...
High ambassadors from America say that President Obama will take a strong stand against Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
In America's new policy for Afghanistan war has been given more importance than development.
The envoys say that Hamid Karzai is being considered a barrier in the achievement of American goals in Afghanistan, as there is corruption in government and the business of middlemen has increased while the Taliban are once more gathering strength.
The American envoy stated that among the people in the American government who are pressing President Hamid Karzai to do something more are, America's Vice President Joseph Biden and President Obama's representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Hallbrooke.
He said that this good administration was noticed after President Bush left, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai every 2 weeks, which used to emphasize the role of America in Afghanistan and the development of its city departments.
Officials say that the Obama administration will work with state leaders as a backup to the main government.
Officials say that they plan to join Hamid Karzai in the fight against corruption.
Hamid Karzai faces new elections this year. It is not yet clear whether Obama and his administration will favor his re-election or not.
Is this statement, of the American officials, a forecast of change in American policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is the reign of Hamid Karzai coming to an end?
What are your thoughts in this matter?
In a series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka in the first day's match, but Sri Lanka won the next two matches.
In the third one-day match, the national team's performance was very poor. They won out in only 75 runs in 23 overs against the 309 runs made by Sri Lanka. The national team should have learned a lesson from this defeat.
The result of the series proves that the national team has no consistency in its performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
Which departments of the game should be addressed more by the authorities?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
Which department will you blame for the defeat: fielding, batting or bowling?
Please provide your feedback.
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish traditions continue. These feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule, who would call them Muslims?
A Sardar, himself should walk over these embers. Why doesn't the present government act against them?
When will the judicial justice be of use?
The Sri Lankan cricket team has arrived in Karachi to play one day internationals.
Despite the tensions between Pakistan and India, it is nice to see a foreign team visit Pakistan.
On reaching the Karachi Airport, the Sirilankan team was given a warm welcome.
There will be two one-day matches in Karachi between Pakistan and Sri Lanka and one in Lahore.
Both sides have made strong claims regarding their bowling, batting and fielding.
While the Sri Lankans are proud of their spinners, Pakistan has its fast bowlers.
The Sirilankan captain Mahela Jayawardene has said that no one player of the Pakistan team can be singled out as a threat, the whole team is dangerous.
Muralitharan and Mendis are said to be trump cards while the Pakistani captain has said that the competition will be a tough one.
Shoaib Malik said they've already played Muralitharan and now they'll get to face Mendis as well. He added that they have a secret game plan which they'll reveal on the pitch.
Will the contest be as exciting as the Pakistanis and Sri Lankans predict?
Who will have the upper hand when the series between Pakistan and Sirilanka gets underway?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Give your opinion.
Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.

The Kashmiri people have been fighting for independence for the last 60 years.
No, no one asked, and they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism, so they start talking about making up.
First they openly killed the Muslims, now they are trying to set things right.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating a situation so that the world's attention can be diverted from Kashmir.
Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now the British Government is also understanding that the Indians are taking cover from their corrpution over Kashmir by blaming Pakistan of terrorism.
They hesitate to talk to Pakistan over this issue.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that resolving the Kashmiri issue will bring an end to extremism, and allow the government of Pakistan effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
Newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister, while talking to media in Mumbai, states that the premise of the War Against Terror is wrong and that killing people just for the threats to one's self was president Bush's policy.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan shouldn't be lenient with the extremist groups.
Due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, India is trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region.
Isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Is India using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialog?
Let us know of your opinion.
Usman Aftab,
I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
Rather it wants to keep it in check, and hence is thinking of taking certain steps. They know that Pakistan is a nuclear state.
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries are only thinking that if they corner Pakistan, they would face some political and geographic problems. They want to help Pakistan, but also want to be successful in their goal.
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is a Ram.
I think that they get nervous over small issues and then warn Pakistan.
We are ready by all means. The Indian Army chief should keep his mouth shut.

Political statements are coming under the mischievous support of America. America is crazy and now Indians are following the same pattern. If India has the courage to attack, it should to know the reality.
Israel is attacking Hamas and no one has the courage to stop them. Mimicking Israel, India also wants to have an adventure.
The Prime Minister said that Byden had a pivotal role in removing Musharraf and restoring the democracy. That is why he was awarded the SI.
No political party can get the credit of uniform shedding and the restoration of democracy. Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in Parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Dr. Qadir's chapter had been closed.
Does public protest against dictatorship have no significance to you?
Did the lawyers movement did not play any role?
What are you going to do at Prime Minister's statement?
Please give us your opinion.
American President George W Bush, in his last Press conference, advised newly elected President Barack Obama that he made many mistakes in his tenure, and Barack Obama should do what he thinks is right.
I, the President, and according with the constitution of USA and law i did the developments, put forward American interest on my own popularity.
He said that America's enemies are still planning to attack America, and the biggest challenge for Barack Obama is to prevent these attacks.
He said that, unable to find the weapon of mass destruction from Iraq was his major dissapointment and to announce the mission completed in Iraq was his big mistake.
In the last press conference from the White House, the American president has said, "This is my last press conference, and I thank all of you news reporters and my colleagues who attended this conference."

This is a sad calamity that Israeli is massacring the Palestinians and the same situation is prevalent in Kashmir, but there is no effect on the Security Council.
All the organizations present in Palestine and Kashmir should keep their war going until they gain independence, and they should form unity among themselves and keep facing any type of harm, and eventually their martyrdom will give fruit, God Willing.
The air attacks by Israel on Gaza are continuing just the same. Until now, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
Important Hamas leader Nazariyan was killed along with his wife and children.
Here the Security Council meeting concluded without any decision.
The meeting saw American opposition to the resolutions passed criticizing Israel by Libya and other Arab countries.
Israel's jet planes have been bombarding the residential areas of Palestine for last many days.
Each country around the world began to protest against the Mumbai attacks but can no one see this brutality?
Why are the major Muslim countries quiet?
What is your opinion on these double standards of the world?
Saeed, New York.
In my opinion, the basic fact is that most of our people are uneducated and they don't even know where their money is actually going. Government is interested in doing its job properly by applying and collecting taxes. Shortfalls of electricity and gas will continue in the same manner.
Because everyone knows about the character of those who have been elected by our own nation.
Shortages of electricity and gas all over Pakistan has become a critical state.
On the other hand, the GAS tariff has been raised to 8%. In some cities unavailability of petrol is increasing the difficulties and miseries of the masses.
Severe reaction to the electricity and gas crisis in Pakistan's industrial and business sector is occuring. Riots and violent protests are taking place.
Industry leaders gave an ultimatum to stop the mills.
Here there is unbelievable situation in cities by the load shedding of light in Karachi from 8 to 10 hours.
The industrial became aproximatly hand less and feet less.
Government institutes are blaming each other.
Talks with nation of increase the prices of electric and gas in not a joke.
Why did not pay attention to solve these problems?
The government is not working to improve the situation.
What are your suggestions to fix these problems?
I am aware of your opionion.
After the loss of Imram, that as there are people as there are commonders.
I wonder if those who shout slogans for an public administration are a nuisance to the public.
It is torture not to get jelly, petroleum and gas.
Government departments have lost control.
Law and order has been degenerated. May Allah show his mercy  on this country of ours.
A new year has begun.
Last year was a year of political turmoil and chaos. It will be remembered for terrorism too.

The new year has set in. How do you feel now at the new year's arrival?
In your opinion, What colour will the political and geographical situations in the country take? What tricks will Obama adopt?

Will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?

It is the first anniversary of the death of Benazir Bhutto. She was slain after an election rally in Liaqat Bagh, Rawalpindi on December 27th, 2007.
Benazir is not among us today. She was a thoughtful politician and a world reknowned figure. She held a special status in national politics.
Although it's been a year now, the mystery of her death remains unsolved.
Her efforts to bring democracy to Pakistan were not in vain.
Today a democratic government exists in Pakistan and her husband, Asif Zardari, currently holds the position of Pakistan President.
What do you think is the role of martyr Benazir Bhutto in Pakistani politics?
Who can be her behind murdering?
Recently,, she was given the global human rights award. What would you like to say about her democratic and political services?
After ruling over America for eight years, President Bush left the White House, for presidential camp office, Camp David, so that the White House can be decorated and prepared for new President Barack Obama, according to his wishes.
In Bush's eight year presidency, the historic World Trade Center attack, the attack on the Pentagon, the action against Afghanistan and Iraq in the name of a global war against terrorism, in which armies of many countries were pulled into the war, and American resources were completely exhausted, were some of the memorable events of the Bush era.
As a result of this war, America had to face the worst economic and financial crisis in history.
What do you think the world gained and lost as a result of these wars?
Were the policies of President Bush successful?
What are your views of the Bush era?
The Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from touring Pakistan.
The Indian Cricket Team had to play three tests, five one day matches and one twenty on Pakistan Tour.
Vice president of the Indian Cricket Board, Rajeev Shukla, said that the board has asked the government to allow the Pakistan Tour but because of the serious matters between the two countries this tour is not possible.
Is it right to use available political issues of the Indian government as the passport to cancel the cricket tour? Shouldn't the games be kept away from politics?
Isn't the decision of the Indian government towards cricket a loss?
Even though the security in India was poor, the English Cricket Team tour was going on, so why can't the Indian team do the Pakistan Tour?
What is your opinion in this regard?
Salman, Karachi.
People who feel proud on going to India.
And their films and videos are made there; now their eyes must open to see that how much the Indian people respect you.
I remember one interview of Adnan Samee where he said I am not a Pakistani, my popularity is British.
Adnan Sami needs to come to Pakistan at the first opportunity because respect was not accorded him even there.
Fareed Ahmad
Karachi
The attitude of Indian citizens has changed after the Mumbai attacks.
Jagjit showed his reaction to this by hating Pakistan and the Pakistani people.
It should be known that Adnan Sami sung seven songs of Asha Bhosla, and now how can he be out of tune? Adnan Sami should stay in India. There is no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam
Karachi. I will only say this about Jagjit Singh: he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements suitable to situation Pakistanis open your eyes that how much you are given worth in India, understand the thinking of Hindu.
After the Mumbai incident, their hateful statements have increased, and now they are spitting poison against popular singer Adnan Sami.
Without my permission at all, a dream takes place in my mind. I must have a house in a beautiful evergreen valley. There must be flowering trees on top of the hill.
Each morning at least one of the flowers that fall from the trees should reach the valley, where my small nest-like house situates.
The second thing was about your future.
At night, while sleeping on the terrace, I must be able to view the whole star-bloomed sky.
I can see the melting mist in the valley, the gold-bangled hands working in the tiled kitchen, watching my hard work bloom up in the compound.
Looking at the twinkling stars, feeling the softness of fondling fingers, inhaling the fragrance of night jasmine.
What is your opinion about this?
By wearing a mask all the time, you lost your face. You have developed the art of having the brightness of truth even while uttering blank lies.
I was always dominated by an uncontrollable thirst for affection.
When my problem is something concerned with money.
Many problems face the people of the world that extend beyond human control.
I feel the main cause is people not thinking clearly.
It's hard to face the problems that may arise in the world's future.
Today we should start working for the well being of everyone.
What do you think of that idea, really?
Poverty, financial crisis, and diseases are the main challenges that people going to face in the future.
What did the people think about the dangerous calamities that have affected many people?
Start today. Are you ready?
We firmly decide today how to solve the problems. It won't be easy. There are risks. But first we should think carefully, and have an attitude toward improvement.
The world has faced many calamities such as earthquakes, floods and tsunami among others. But we still don't prepare well enough for such disasters.  We're good at clean up after disasters but our scientist need to find ways of prediction.

September.
Chicago.
It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember that she killed many innocent people in Karachi and that she was proud that Naiseer Ullah Baber had done a great job.
But than she totally changed.
It is also true that he neglects the senior people in his party and instead chose his son as the party leader.  What kind of Democracy is this?
Jimmy Noor, Karachi, this news proved that the Quran said that Non-believers will support only Non-Believers.
An axe cant cut the wood if it does not have a wooden handle.
Our leaders are responsible for the hardships and problems our country is in.
May God bless our leaders with righteousness.
The panel of the UN's Security Council has included the names of Hafaiz Saeed and three other Pakistanis in the list of terrorists.
The names of Hafiz Mohammad Saeed (the chief Jamat-ul-dawa), Rehman Lakhvi (Lashkar-i-taiba's Chief of Operations), and Haji Mohammad Ashraf (Lashar-i-taiba's Head of Finance) have been included in the list of terrorists.

Besides these, a Saudi citizen, Mehmood Ahmed, is also part of this list of terrorists.
Jamat-ul-dawa, Passban-i-kashmir and Alrashid trusts are included in these organizations.
The member countries will freeze the assets of these people and organizations. These people will not be allowed to travel and they will be arrested if they do.
They have to face trials.
Aren't these sanctions made under the influence of Indian propaganda?
Why is India blaming these parties for the Bombay attacks without any proof?
Are there not any terrorist groups in India?
Are International groups not aware of the tortures being done to the minorities in India?
