Avoiding Dieting to Prevent the Flu.	Abstain From Dieting To Avoid Flu	Abstain from decreased eating to escape from flu.	In order to better resist flu, quit dieting. 
This research of American scientists came in front of experimenting on mice.	This finding by American scientists resulted from experimentation on rats.	This research of American scientists was published after many experiments on mice.	According to the American Scientist this research has come out after many experimentations on rats. 
Experiments proved that mice on a lower calorie diet had comparatively less ability to fight the flu virus.	It was demonstrated in these experiments that rats on low-calorie diets had lessened ability to resist the flu virus.	The experiments proved that mice who consumed less calories had less defense against the flu.	Experiments have proved that those rats on lower calories diets developed a tendency not to overcome the flu virus . 
Research disproved the old axiom that " It is better to fast during fever"	Research has proven the old myth  of fasting during fever wrong.	The research disproved the old wives tale that eating less is useful in preventing the fever.	This Research has proved wrong the very old saying that it is better to starve a fever.

In many modern countries it is sometimes fashionable to think that, by free education for all-whether rich or poor, clever or stupid- one can solve all the problems of the society.	Professor Elizabeth Gardner said that those who are dieting are not only affected by the flu more quickly, but also take longer to recover.	According to Professor Elizabeth Cardener, people on diets will be more susceptible to the flue virus and may also take longer to recover once infected.

We find in such countries a far larger number of people with University degrees than there are jobs for them to fill.	She also said that those who have taken flu vaccines should also avoid dieting for a few months during the winter.	The professor recommends that people who have taken the flue vaccination, discontinue their diet over the summer in order to elude the virus. 
'First Nuclear Experiment was conducted in 1990'	The Plan of Education Implemented in 1990.	First Nuclear Test Done in 1990.	The first nuclear test was in 1990. 
Thomas Reid, who has worked in the Lever National Laboratory in America as a weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the former director of technical intelligence at Los Alamos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.	Because of their degrees, they refuse to do what they think low work and in fact work with the hands is thought to be dirty and shameful in such countries.	Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer, had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.	Thomas Red,  former director of Cooperation at the National Laboratory Technical Committee of Los Angeles, has written a book. 
This book was titled "Nuclear Express: Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation," and both writers have claimed that whichever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or had the support of another nuclear power.	The work of a completely uneducated farmer is far more important than that of a professor: we can live without education, but we die if we have no food. If no one cleaned our streets and took the rubbish away from our houses, we should get terrible diseases in our towns.	In this book called 'Nuclear Express,' the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.	Thomas C. Reed and Danny B. Stillman wrote the Book, The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation.  They conclude that the U.S. has tested an atom bomb and may also house nuclear secrets. 
in an interview with US news, Thomas Reed said that in 1990, during the rule of Benazir Bhutto, China texted Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.	In fact, when we say that all of us must be educated to fit us for life, it means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited.	Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990 during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.	In a 1970 interview with USAID news, Thomas Red stated that when Benazir Bhutto was the leader in Pakistan, China conducted its first nuclear bomb experiment. 
Thomas Reid said that, for many reasons, he believes that China had tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.	Education is not an end but a means to an end. In other words we do not educate children only for the purpose of educating them.	Thomas Reid said that, due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.	According to Thomas Red, there are several reasons to beleive that China has tested a nuclear bomb. 
The reasons include the design of the bomb and some information gained during talks with the Chinese scientists.	When men become organized into very large groups, a civilization develops.	Among the factors are the design of the bomb and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.	Evidence suggests that Chinese scientists designed the bomb. 
He further added that this was the reason that in 1998 in a span of only two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments in response to Indian nuclear experiments.	It is possible to get freedom from hunger, thirst, cold, heat and many diseases, so that each person can live a happier life than he could.	He further added this was the reason that Pakistan was able to respond to India's Nuclear test with a nuclear test in just 2 weeks and 3 days.	Red went on to say that, in 1990, both India and Pakistan tested their nuclear bomb capabilities within two weeks of each other. 
Thomas Reid reminds us that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiments.	It means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited to his brain and ability, and secondly, that we can realize that all jobs are necessary to society and that is very bad to be ashamed of ones work or to scorn someone else.	Thomas Reid reminded us that in 1961 Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test, in response to which America took 17 days to perform a test, despite having had this bomb for a long time.	Thomas Red reiterates that Russia tested nuclear capabilities 17 days after a nuclear test by the United States in 1970. 
He further said that atomic bomb test Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998 was made with extreme care, and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.	He said further that in May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with care, and Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.	He added that the atom bomb that was tested on May 19th 1998 by Pakistan was made very carefully, and that Pakistani scientists had complete faith in it.	He further said that in May 1998, Pakistan had mentioned the atom bomb experiment in the Pakistani scientists' confidence. 
When Thomas Reeds was questioned about China providing nuclear technology to Pakistan he replied that India was a common enemy for Pakistan and China.	When Thomas Reed was asked if China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan, he replied that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.	When Thomas Reid was asked whether China had provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.	When Thomas Red was questioned about the nuclear technology that China had provided to Pakistan, he said that they have a common enemy: India. 
He said that there is a proof that Doctor Abdul Qadeer Khan used Chinese designs, and the documents which were acquired from Libya confirm this statement.	He said that there is evidence that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan has used the Chinese model. Later the documents received from Libya also confirm this.	He said that there was proof that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and that the documents received from Libya will verify this fact.	He said Chinese designer Dr. Khan has the proof after which the documents from Libya in this connection have been confirmed. 
On an additional question about whether doing combined nuclear tests is common then he said that in 1990, America conducted a nuclear test for Britain on an open belt in Nevada desert.	Another question that is it common to do nuclear experiments mutually. Then he said that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.	Upon further questioning as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.	The question of the nuclear tests are by the United States and the British in the deserts. 
He said that he also assumed that Israel was given access to the results of this test.	He said that we also predicted that Israel has access to the results of this experiment.	He said that we also believe that Israel has access to the results of this testing.	He said that Israel has also experienced the same result. 
Thomas Reed was also questioned whether the Chinese nuclear spread program is continuing?	Thomas Reeds was also asked if China was continuing nuclear proliferation.	Thomas Reid was also asked about China's nuclear distribution program which is ongoing.	To Thomas Red, the most pressing question about China's nuclear program is the ""proliferation."" 
On this, Thomas Reed said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and design to a nuclear facility in Iran's city Isfahan since 1990.	On this Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and the design to an Iranian nuclear facility in Asfahan.	In answer, Thomas Reid said that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Esfahan, Iran since 1991.	Thomas Red said that from 1970 to 1991, the Iranian city of China had set up the nuclear installation for the raw material and for providing instructions. 
China also provided Iran a nuclear enrichment plant.	Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.	In conjunction with this, China provided Iran with the nuclear enrichment plant in Kheraj.	In addition to this, China has also provided a Uranium plant to Iran. 
He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen through North Korea.	He said that China had been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Rome, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen via North Korea.

Protest against the siding of Journalists.	Protest against the removal of journalists	Protest Against the Removal of Journalists	The dismissal of journalists was protested. 
I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hall of thermonuclear destruction. I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality.	On Tuesday, the organization of journalists, RIUJ, held protests in front of the Islamabad Press Club of Journalists and Newspaper Workers against media owners and the government about the news channel and newspapers removing many of their employees.	Many print and electronic media journalists held protest demonstration under the backing of RIUJ against the downsizing of different media organizations. They were shouting slogans against media owners and the government.	On Tuesday, the journalists in Islamabad went on a protest in front of the press club.  Newspaper workers, TV journalists, and employees of newspapers and large media companies raised protest slogans. 
I believe that even amid today's mortar bursts and whining bullets, there is still hope for a brighter tomorrow. I believe that wounded justice, lying prostrate on the blood flowing streets of our nation can be lifted from this dust of shame or reign supreme among the children of men.	Speaking to the protesters, a senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, the Federal Union of Journalists,  C.R. Shamsi said, "The politicians who protested with us yesterday on the streets, today, have become rulers and are sitting in Parliament. Out of fear of a certain lobby of media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of journalists."	CR Shamsi, a senior member of RIUJ, addressed the gathering. He said the same politicians who were protesting on roads with us, now are ruling this country. They have not had enough courage to take actions against some power media owners.

Newspaper owners joined them due to the fear for the rights of journalists. 
I have the audacity to believe that people everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits.	He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.	He said that the owners of media groups talked about human rights, but they are exploiting the poor journalists by killing them financially.	He said that the human rights to the newspaper owners should be assured by these organizations. The punishment and imprisonment of workers may lead to loss of billions of rupees in annual profits. 
This faith will give us courage to face the uncertainties of the future. It will give our tired bodies new strength as we advance toward the city of freedom.	An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.	One example of the exploitation is the suicide of a reporter on a Lahore based Private TV channel. He had not been paid his salary for four months. The media workers are living hand to mouth under the constant stress of downsizing and under payment.	An example of this is that channel five, a private TV station in Lahore.  A member commited suicide for not recieving salary, and many workers are anxious because they haven't been paid in months. 
When our days become dreary with low-hovering clouds and our nights become darker than a thousands midnights, we will know that we are living in the creative turmoil of a genuine civilization.

I still believe that one day mankind will bow down before the altars of god and be crowned triumphant over war and bloodshed,and that non-violent redemptive will be proclaimed the rule of the land. The lion and the lamb shall lie down together and every man shall sit under his own vine.

The villagers were curious about me, and strange as it may seem, I had not anticipated it. It usually showed itself in their asking me direct questions.	He said that until now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been removed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is being feared that the owners will remove hundreds more in the present year, making an excuse of the present financial crisis.

If looked at from a government perspective, the diplomatic efforts going on to stop the Middle East War are most decisive.

According to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.	It is the official stand of Brussels, that Schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of Sarkozy offer helping hands in this process.

As far as the state policy is concerned, everyone seems alright.	In light of the government's statement all seems to be fine.	Everything seems fine, as far as the official statement is concerned.	Everything seems fine, officially. 
However, in reality, the European Union is in a sad state of internal differences.	However, in reality, the European Union is presenting a view of conflict amongst each other, an idea that is very sad.	But in reality the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.	But, European Union is, in fact, portraying a picture of internal tension, stress and strain.

On the other hand, French President Sarkozy's demeanor suggests that he is the president of the Union.

The most ridiculous situation faces the foreign minister of France, Bernard Kouchner.	The most funny situation is faced by the French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner.	The most comedic situation is for the Ambassdor of France Mr. Bernard Kouchner.	French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner faces the most pleasant task. 
He is part of the delegation, which is being headed by Schwarzenberg, the Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic.	He is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of the Czech Republic, Schwarzenberg.	He is also involved in this, with guidance from the Ambassador of the Czech Republic, Mr. Schwarzenberg.

What's worse, both the foreign ministers are giving different statements about the war in the Middle East.	The problem is both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements about war in the Middle East.	Not only do their opinions differ, they also might have to face a battle with the western world.	In addition, the two foreign ministers are giving different statements on the war in Middle East. 
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself, whereas according to Kouchner this war does not come under defense policy. On the other side, Germany has also sent its special ambassador to the Middle East. The European Union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues.	Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense, whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense.

Until the European Union come to an agreement, they won't win the battle.	Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend herself, while according to Kouchner war is not the answer.  Germany has also sent a special ambassador to the Middle East. As long as European Union does not show a unanimous stand, she can not be successful on the diplomatic front. 
Its evidence is the reaction of Israel, which does not give any importance to the conciliation efforts of the EU.	The proof for this is,  Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.	This is the proof of Israel, which is doesn't provide any response to the European Countries.	The proof is that Israel has ignored the EU's diplomatic efforts. 
EU has a golden chance of getting something done because America has lost in the Middle East due to the policies of George Bush.	This is a golden chance for the European Union to do something since America, due to the policies of George W. Bush, has already failed in the Middle East.	This is the best time for the European Union to perform because America has failed on the western side due to the policies of George W. Bush.

Economic Setback: Suicide of German Billionaire Industrialist	Financial Crisis: Suicide of Billionaire German Industrialist.	Capitalism Revolution: Death of German millionare.	Financial crisis: German millionaire industrialist commits suicide. 
Adolf Meerklay, residing in the area of Sawabia in southern Germany, has  left a great business group behind him.	Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany, left a huge business group behind him.	In the south of Germany, a place by the name of Subia. Adolf Miracle has left big business people behind him.	Adolf Marclay, a resident of Swabia in south Germany has left behind a huge industrial company. 
But earlier common German citizens did not know much about him.	But, a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.	Some time ago the german people didn't know him.	But he was not well known to German public until recently. 
Later when he had to conference, about the loan given to his industrial group, with almost 30 banks for many weeks, he also became topic of the headlines. And he could see a dark future of Meerklay groups.	when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.	After which business people found it difficult to raise funds from 30 banks.  Then  he(name) was in the headline of a newspaper: this is a reflection of a bad future for the mircle group.	When he had to negotiate with 30 banks for weeks regarding his debts towards industrial companies, he became big news, and could see the dark future for the Marckay Group. 
The Merkel Group had to suffer financial losses of many millions of Euro after its investment to buy shares of German auto maker Volkswagen.	The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.	The aim of advertising is always to sell the product or let the people know the various facilities made available to them either at the market or at their doorstep.	Marclay Group had to bear the loss of hundreds of millions of euros after it bought the shares from the known industry, Folks Wigan. 
Then monetary institutions canceled this groups loan amounting to 700 million and another 1 billion Euro that it necessarily required and hence Merkel came into extreme pressure.	Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 million to one billion euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle was under intense pressure.	When a product is being advertised we are able to gather more information such as its name, price, benefits and availability.	The financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed one billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on Marclay. 
Some time back, the bank agreed to provide Merkel Group an emergency loan. But, Adolf Merkel,who raised a small industrialist group to the position of a strong industrial group whose annual income was approximately 30 billion Euro, could not bare the loss in his investment capability.	Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had gone from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic power.	But sometime the drafted messages tends to be fictional, owing to either exaggeration or to false claims made by the advertiser. Viewed objectively, the advertising message must act as a salesperson and do its best to convince the consumer of the merits of the product.	Recently the same banks accepted to provide a loan to Marclay group on urgent basis. Adolf Marclay who started as a small industrialist, has industrial group's annual income reached 30 billion euros, couldn't bear the the loss in his financial strength. 
Adolf Merkel started managing the business and modernize it after the death of his parents. The business under his supervision became very popular and became more strong.	After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quickly, putting it on a new track.	The words used in advertisements are typical of a salespersons' language and this is how he would like to convince his prospective buyer, should they come face-to-face.	After the death of his father, Adolf Marclay took the responsibility of the business. He used modern methods to make his business more successful. 
He named his company Ratiopharm, which is today Germany's very large acclaimed and successful pharmaceutical company.	He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.	The name of this advertisement is Ratiopharm. The words used by the salesperson definitely praise the product or service that is available.	He named his company Ratiopharm which is now Germany's most successful and biggest pharmaceutical company. 
Some time back, the commercial value of this company was in between 5 and 6 billion Euro and still was earning a revenue of 8.1 billion Euro annually. After the great success of Ratiopharm, the Merkel Group acquired many big businesses, which included building materials makers. Hydelberg cement to modified/special car maker Kassbohrer company.	Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm,the  Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.	More often, they are colorful and catchy words as they persuade the customer to respond favorably and force him to purchase the product. Unless cosmetics and other like Kassbohrer products are heavily promoted, they will languish unsold on the shelves of this stores for a long time.	Until recent times this pharmaceutical company had a budget of around 5 to 6 billion euros and is now earning around 8 billion euros annually. After the great success of Rasue farm the Marclay Group bought many big industries such as Hi-Del Barag Cement, a manufacturer of construction equipment as well as Kassbohrer, a good car maker. 
The workforce of Merkel Group is nearly about 100,000 throughout the world and its assets include Ratiopharm, which always was the most important business in the portfolio.	The number of employees of the Merkel Group around the world is near 100,000, and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical company Ratiopharm, always had special importance.	So, advertising always puts forward the best points of the product. Advertisement can be educational, entertaining, informative, handy and surely interesting.	Marclay Group has a employee number of around 100 thousand around the world and among its industries, Rasue Farm has always been given special importance. 
Adolf Merkel, during his lifetime, expressed the view that it has been four generations that we have been in pharmaceutical business.	Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.	At times, however, they tend to be boring, irritating, incredible and embarrassing.	Adolf Marclay has said this many times in his life. """"We have been in pharma business since four generations"""". 
Now the management of this institution is with my children and I hope this institution will be managed by and in possession of my family for few hundred years.	Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the management of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.	Another category of advertisements tends to brag so as to tempt the buyers.	Now the industry is handled by his children and I hope that it continues to progress for a few hundred years by our family. 
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, the banks have provided approval for temporary loans of 400 million Euro for VEM Group, but added the condition that VEM should sell off Ratiopharm to improve the financial situation for a long term sustainability.	After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks sanctioned 400 million euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it can improve its financial conditions in the long term.	But whatever it may be, advertisements have a two-fold purpose to serve. They have a message to convey and they attempt to evoke a desirable response in the buyer. As a result 400 VEM product become popular ones and the demand increases.	After the suicide of Adolf Marclay,the banks have given approval of temporary loan of 400 million euro for his group VEM, but on the condition that VEM has to be sold to Rasio Farm in order to improve the financial position of this group. 
Likewise after the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain as it was.	Therefore, after Adolf Merkeley's demise, the Merkeley Group came to an end.	this way Merchlay group will stay as it used to be after the death of Adolph Merchley	After the death of Adolf Marclay, the Marclay Group will not remain the same as it was before.

According to Joachim Herrmann, the Bavarian Interior Minister, this would appear to be a positive change.	In the view of Joachim Herrmann, the Minister for Home Affairs of Bavaria, it has been a positive change.	According to Interior minister Joachim Herrmann of the province Bavaria, this is a superficial positive change.	According to Joachim Herrmann the Interior Minister of Bavaria it is only an apparent positive change. 
He said: "It is important to note that the number of foreigners getting German citizenship is increasing."	He said: "It is to be noted that the number of aspirants seeking German citizenship has increased."	He said "It should be noted that that the number of outsiders seeking immigration to Germany is increasing."	He said that it must be considered that foreigners having the German citizenship are increasing. 
Therefore this should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German, his background is foreign.	The statistics would have shown the fact that most of the criminals were German citizens.	Hence, this should also be stated in statistics that the criminal is a German citizen but his background is non-immigrant.	So it must be added in the statistics that the criminal is a German citizen of foreign birth. 
Herrmann said that his province will take this into account when gathering statistics in 2010.	Based on this, a foreigner said when statistics of crime are taken in his homeland in 2010, the above mentioned factors will be taken for consideration by Herrmann.	He said that his province will also consider this while collecting statistics.	Herrmann said that from 2010 his state will keep this fact in mind while collecting the data of criminals. 
Besides Bavaria, Hamburg is also thinking  along the same lines.	Mentions have been made in his letters about Humberg except Baaveria.	A part from Bavaria the same is being planned in Hamburg.	Other than Bavaria, Hemberg is also working on the same pattern.

The results are based on the figures and numbers which are the outcome of the research."

Ahlhaus referred to a state-wide objective reporton crime prevention,which was prepared in 2006. The report indicated what percent of the people committing crimes from Bergdorf to Hamburg were foreigners.	Ahlhaus brought the attention towards an analysis report of 2006 prepared by a regional (provincial) office of Crime Prevention, in view of which it was calculated that in the crimes happening from bergdorf to hamburg, what is the percentage of foreigners involved.

President George Bush: Terrorism Still a Threat for America	The President George Bush is a danger for terrorism on America.	President George Bush: Terrorism is Still a Threat to USA	President George W. Bush, terrorism for the United States is still a threat. 
Mehr news agency reported from German news agencies that American President George Bush said in his farewell speech, addressing his successor Barack Obama and the whole nation, that if compared to seven years ago, America is relatively safe, nevertheless, the threat of terrorism is still floating over the head of America.

MEHER/MAHAR news agency has copied from the German news agency that the US President, while addressing his successor Barak Obama and the nation in his farewell speech, said that though the US is safer than it was seven years ago, the threat of terrorism still looms over USA.	The Mehr news agency, the German news agency Mehr, the US president George Bush, in his valedictory speech and his successor, addressed the nation and said that if the height of seven years ago today the United States safe, but the threat of terrorism and the US round today. 
The history of civilization shows how man always has to choose between making the right and the wrong use of the discoveries of science. This has never been more true than in our own age.	Mr. Bush said the terrorist are prepared to attack America and are waiting for the right moment and they have strong determination to attack. So America should not show any negligence for its national security.	Bush said that the enemy terrorists are waiting patiently to attack America, and they have a strong determination to attack America so America should never be unaware about its security.	Bush has said that the United States was designed to prevent terrorist attacks. Our enemy sits patiently, waiting for a chance to attack the US. Their unflinching plans should be a signal for our government to step up on protecting the country. 
In a brief period amazing discoveries have been made and applied to practical purposes. It has become platitude to say we are living in an age of revolution. It would be ungrateful not to recognize how immense are the boons which science has given to mankind. It has brought within reach multitudes of benefits and advantages which, only a short time ago, were the privilege of the few. It has shown how malnutrition, hunger and disease can be overcome.	The American President ignored the suffering of millions of Palestinian people and defended his aggressive and wrong policies. The American President said, America even today is the biggest country that supports freedom but the experts don't buy this idea and are of the opinion that this claim is not  realistic because not only America is not the flag bearer of freedom but also not a supporter of human rights. In fact America is the biggest terrorist country in the world that not only is supporting the barbaric Israeli Government but also directly involved with Israel in committing the crimes.	The American President ignored the hurt and suffering of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, and defended his policies saying that America is still the biggest supporter country of independence. However, commentators do not accept the reality of the unpopular president's remarks, as America is neither a supporter of freedom, nor a supporter of human rights, but rather it is the most mischievous country in the world, which not only supports a bloodthirsty country like Israel, but is also directly involved in its crimes.	The American president is currently in the Gaza Strip. Millions of Palestinians are reduced grief due to his  aggressive US policies. In defense, the president said today that: ""The United States is the biggest free country in the world, but observers of the American president disagree. They believe that the United States shouldn't be pioneering human rights on their own accord. Supporters in the body of the Israeli government believe that some of the ways the US accomplishes things are ""savage"". 
It has not only lengthened life but it has deepened its' quality. Fields of knowledge, experience and recreation often in the past only to a few, have been thrown open to millions.	Israel is committing massacre by slaughtering children, women and common people and America's President is praising him. This is the humanity and freedom the America that the world is witnessing in Gaza and other parts of the world.	Israel openly kills children, women and civilians and the American president is congratulating them. This is the American humanity and freedom which the world is seeing in Gaza and other places.	Israel children, Women, and common citizens deeply agreed with the president's view of freedom

The car, a motor-driven vehicle, facilitates business and gives harmless enjoyment to many, but it has caused more causalities in one year in this country alone.	He further said that one sided cease fire was a failed attempt by the Israel to avoid a defeat. If Israel wanted sustainable peace then it would not only need to end the siege of Gaza but also accept the terms proposed by Hamas.

Hamdan said that if Israel wants long-term peace, it will have to accept Hamas's conditions as well as end this siege.	He said that the cease-fire was to avoid defeat.

The cinema is a means of instruction and recreation opening magic casements, but it is often a channel of vulgarity and false values.

In Beirut, attending a conference in solidarity with the Gaza people Asama Hamadan asked the European countries to discontinue diplomatic relations with Israel.	Addressing a one-way conference from Beirut, Usamah Hamdan called for European nations to break ties with Israel.	In the Gaza Strip, the relations that Hamas had with Europe and other countries will soon be dissolved. 
It can also become a weapon of destruction. It is this two-fold aspect of the methods to which science can be applied that has raised a valid concern to most people.	The representative of Hamas said that with the increasing number of Martyrs and injured people in Gaza our resolve is getting even more stronger for our cause.	The Hamas leader said that the increasing numbers of the martyred and injured will only increase our determination.	The Hamas leader said that ""As the number of injured people increases, our forces, strength, and willpower shall also increase."" 
It is morally justifiable to see a supposedly perfect invention a possible means of destruction.	He emphasized to the Palestinian people that they should continue to be strong and bold in resisting the enemy.	He told the Palestinian public to stay firmly rooted and resist the enemy like a boulder.	The Hamas leader said that ""The Palestinian people should protect their country with a fortified resistance""

They surrendered their rule to the government of Pakistan, according to a treaty.	With the help of an agreement they transferred the administration of Swat to the Pakistani government.	He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a  pact.	Pakistan ruled the south for a while. 
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a step mother.	But it's disheartening to know that our government treated Swat like a step mother would treat another's child.	However, it is matter of sorrow that our government treated Swat like a step-mother.	But tragically our government like a stepmother toward the South.

Thousands of boy's and girl's are being deprived of education.	Thousands of students are being deprived of education.	Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.	Thousands of students (boys and girls) are unable to get an education.

Because the people of Swat have realized this was a game and that the army was there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them. Otherwise, how could five schools be blown up in a single curfew night? How could people be slaughtered during curfew and hung in the center of the town?	because the people of Swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them, otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that during the Curfew. How come people can be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing.	Now, the people of Swat understand the game:  The military is there to support the Taliban, not to kill them, for how is it possible that 5 schools can be blown up in Karfuo, and people slaughtered and hanged in the street?	Because Swat people has understand the game that army is there to serve Taliban not to kill them otherwise how five schools can be destroyed in a single night during curfew, how people can be butchered and hanged in the square. 
When the government is not being allowed to have any say in Swat, how can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps?	When the writ of the government is not being carried out and enforced, how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities?

Now, the question arises as to how, when the government has an armed military, new and dangerous weapons, new technology and spy system etc., these four Taliban elements are not being controlled?	now the question arises that having an armed force, armed with modern weapons, modern technologies and intelligence system, why the government can not control these few Taliban.	Next the question arises that with all the advance technology, destructive weapons, and an effective spy system, why is the Taliban still not in control?	Now the question is when government has every thing like armed force, latest weapons, latest technology and spy system then why these Taliban can;t be controlled? 
The answer to this is that they have the hand of a hidden guide on their heads, because of which neither their weapons get exhausted nor do they get captured.	The only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head, that neither their arms can reach nor they are apprehended.	The answer is they have the hand of some secret power, which is why their weapons never run out and they are never arrested.	The only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught. 
The conclusion is that the Taliban, through their dark activities, are making the work of the global leadership easier.	The result of the discussion is that the Taliban with their wrong steps are making it easier for the imperialists.	The conclusion is that the Taliban, with their deeds, are making the work easier for world control.

ISI was controlling Taliban while it's opponent, the North Coalition, was supported by Russia, India and Iran.	ISI had control over the Taliban, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran. 
Then suddenly the scenario changed and the activities of the Taliban came to light.	Then, suddenly, the situation changed and the Taliban's works came to light.	Suddenly, the situation changed and the Taliban began to act.	Then there were sudden changes by which the activities of the Taliban came to light. 
The ISI also was offered financial aid by the Americans which resulted in past friends becoming foes.	And ISI also got an offer of Dollars from America, so the previous friend became an enemy.	ISI was also offered American fundsing, so past friends became enemies.	ISI received dollar offerings from America; thereby close friends turned to enemies. 
Now the scenario is that the war is still raging but the supporters in Pakistan are still the same Iran, India, and Russia.	Now the situation has changed, but the war is still going on and the countries supporting them in Pakistan are still Russia, India, and Iran.	Now the situation is that this war continues, but still helping in Pakistan are Iran, India and Russia.	The results are this the war continues, but in reality Pakistan is helped by Iran, India and Russia. 
Until mankind can understand the difference between whats right and whats wrong he will always make the wrong decision.	Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.	Human will keep making mistakes until a feeling of what is right and wrong emerges.	It is a human mistake of doing wrong by not doing what is right. 
For example, if a thief intends to commit a crime, realizes it's wrong he will also fear his Lord and then he will not commit the crime.	For instance, if a thief realizes when he goes to steal on object that stealing is wrong-- that it is a curse and it will bring punishment-- and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.	For example, a thief will still steal until he believes stealing is a curse and there is punishment for it; until he fears from God, then that Human will steal.	If a thief robs a place, then he is in danger to rob the same place and same time tomorrow as well. If he fears god and man, he will not steal. 
Similarly, unless and until Israel understands that it is doing the wrong thing by shedding the blood of innocent people in Gaza and that it will be punished, it will continue to kill innocent people there.	Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, it will receive punishment for that and will continue to play with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.	Likewise, unless Israel inderstand it is wrong for it to drain the blood of innocents, and that there will be  punishment for this, it will keep playing Holi with the innocent blood of Gaza.	Similarly, Israel should realize that it is wrong to shed blood in Gaza.

If the entire Muslim world gets together and even just threatens Israel, you will see how much Israel's daddy, America, will get hurt.	If the whole Muslim world just give a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see  how upset its father, America, will be.

I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is similar to considering them defeated.	i think at this hard time advising hammas to stop struggling in the name of peace would be injustified with thousands of widows and millions of orphans, and it would be similar to prove them wrong.

Suppose that Hamas is 100% truthful, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah.

In this practice, our Pakistani Wire-net media, in particular some columnists and newspapers are not far behind any more, as they are writing with courage against the growing extremism and terrorism and stressing a lot upon "Muawiyah hate".	Now even the electronic media and printed media of Pakistan, specifically a few Urdu newspapers and columnists, are not behind anybody else in exhibiting this skill-- who, while giving coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism, and while writing about it, hide facts about the grudge mafia.	In this art now a days; the Pakistani electronic and print media, especially some Urdu newspapers and columnists, are no more behind anyone who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism, or in the ""grudge of Muavia"" written on them.	Now In this regard our Pakistani print and electronic media, specially few Urdu newspapers and columnists etc., are not behind in the trade who in the coverage or writing of increasing terrorism exaggerate to hell. 
He said that the United Nations speaks of human rights and peace, but though the Muslims ar being oppressed greatly, you hear them say that until Hamas does not stop its attacks, this unfair policy will continue.	It has been said that the United Nations seemingly supports human rights and peace but actually the Muslims are being subjected to extreme levels of cruelty and brutality. And what we hear from the United Nations is that Hamas should stop the attacks. How long will this hypocrisy carry on?	Has said that the United Nations, which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of it's mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. How long will this hypocrisy continue?	One face of the United Nation appears to care about human rights and peace; the other face allows Muslims to be wronged and tortured to their limits while condemning Hamas attacks.  How long will they continue to have this two-faced policy? 
Why Muslims are getting abused, if country like America will leave the back support of Jews then Allah has said clearly that this caste will spend there life contemptible and this caste can not spend there life good,  if American Citizens have the guts to leave the back support of Jews then see the fortune of the life of Jews	Why there is so much atrocity committed on Muslims. If people like Americans are backing up the Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So, Americans, if you have courage then stop supporting them and see then what their fate is.	Why is so much oppression being done on the Muslims? If country like America stop supporting these Jews, then Allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support, and then see what kind of life they get.	Why are the Muslims tortured so much?  If the American people would stop favouring Jews, then they would live worse lives, as God said.  So, Americans, stop favoring the Jews and allow them to see their fate. 
The people who are killing and murdering people in the name of peace and justice have to understand this clearly: that in this world, peace will come only by administering an oath, not by doing injustice and dissemination.	These so-called writers and murderers in name of peace should understand that peace in the world can only be obtained through justice and not through genocides.	The just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.	All these world renowned leaders and people who murder innocents in the name of peace should realize that peace in the world can only be achieved by justice, and not through injustice or wiping out entire races. 
If only by doing dissemination you can kill the caste and want to withdraw the results what you want, then after Hitlers measure not only the Jews caste was continued but in one way the ascent as today was impossible	If any nations can be perished through genocide and results of choice can be obtained then after actions of Hitler, existence of Jews and their uprising was impossible.	If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.	If killing a particular race off completely is the answer, then Hitler's plan would not have seen any Jews survive, and definitely not seen them rise again.

As for elections, there is no doubt, to gain public support, such actions will have to be taken for the sake of power, especially in a state like Israel. As for Barack Obama, history is witness that no American ruler has been able to go against the American policy and nor will they go. Whether the ruler is white or black, he is still a ruler.	In Israel, such tactics are used by ruling party to achieve public support.Historically no president was powerful enough to change American policies.Barrack Obama is no exception. Forces of Exploitation are similar in their character; whether they are black or white.	Concerning elections, the rulers should do such things to gain people's support. There is no doubt about this especially when countries like Israel exist. Stop talking about Barrack Obama. History is a witness that no American leader has gone against this policy. They will not do it. A regime, whether black or white, is a regime.	As far as elections are concerned, it is not surprising that the people who are in power do such things to win the heart and mind of people, especially in a state like Israel. And speaking of Barak Obama, history shows that no American president has wavered from the policy and will not do so in future. A tyrant is a tyrant whether he is white or black.

In compensation for the Mumbai attacks, the abnormal diplomatic and military benefits that India tried to gain, made it more a victimizing party, than a victim.

Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it more clever than effective and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction, the world community has relaxed its' pressure now.

Any day affirmation comes through then there are many possibilities that in this National Unity there will be no one to speak up to voice support for us.	The extremists of our country and their supporters are constantly providing all the evidence and justification required for the instigation of action against them.  God forbid that the day when such a resolution is passed, in all likelihood not a single voice will be raised in the United Nations in our favor.	Extremists and their supporters are continuously providing reasons for the actions taken against them. When such a resolution is submitted, it will be likely that no one will favor us in the UN. 
Supposing the passing of such a resolution is delayed, some other strength will definitely leave our aid to ourself,, keeping the example of America in front of them.	If supposing there is any delay for Affirmative to pass then we can keep an example of America in the forefront so that any one of  power will join us to walk with us.	And supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.	If the resolution takes too long to approve, it is possible other countries may act on their own, following America's example. 
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.	We dont have the consciousness and knowledge of Sami-Ullah or his personality and his experience with the work he was busy in.

But here, an international game is being played. Here ferociousness  and animosity are created to do the ruling.	But there is an international game being played over here. Here, they are ruling by scaring the public about beastliness and terror.	There is an international game being played here, in which the public is ruled by fear through barbarism and ferociousness.	But they were playing international game here and, is being boorishness and brutality, people scared of the rule.

These acts of so-called Islamic activists in the name of religion should be utterly condemned.	Calling Islam an endless religion is a condemnable action. 
America sees the torture of these extremists, but instead of being sad on these faithless activities, they easily name them as tribal culture.	The supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of America, but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions, they give it the name of tribal traditions and clearly avoid it.	The supporters of extremists can see the injustice of America, but instead of expressing grieve on those dishonest acts they clearly shun them by giving them the name of tribal traditions.	The extremists give support to the cruelty of the United States. But this looks like a brutal action against the tribal tradition. 
The reason for these faithless activities, sometimes given in the name of tribal culture and other times in the name of Islam, is not something done by a person with a heart.	No person with a heart can accept these beastly actions, which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of Islam.	Sometimes by cloaking in tribal traditions, sometimes in the name of Islam, no pious man can give reason for such dishonest acts.	The tradition of the Mantel Lucrative tribals is not to take brutal action in the name of Islam 
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.	I think our army has joint these people.	In my view, our Army is associated with theses people.	In my opinion our army, people will get the people. 
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.	This is because these people take some time to move around. To catch them will only take so much time. But even if they were there, they escape from there.	When these people move from a place, it takes so much time that they can be caught.  There should be time for that, but it's a stretch that they get there on time, even if they are there, they are long gone.	They are the move, a copy of this time, so take the laser, the timetable for, so, but they will be on the occasion, and they go there, there are also have the darn cycle. 
Are they so clever that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?	Are these people so brave that they take 50 or 70 people hostage and our army watches like an audience with hand on hand?	Are they so merciless that they kidnap fifty seventy men?  And our Army stands by like a spectator.	Are these people that they are so Bahadur 50 70 men are held hostage to our army and hand it to respond to keep the hand of spectators, questionably. 
They are also men of God and so is our army.	They are servants of Allah and so is the army.	They are servants of Allah and so is our Army.	They are also the civilians and the army. 
It is very clear that there is something fishy.	It is clear that something is sinister.	There is something wrong at the bottom.	It is clear that there is some pulse. 
Instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and punitive occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion, was seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.	In Ziya-ul-Haqq's dictatorship, instead of presenting the Noble and Merciful characters of God, an atmosphere of anti-religion was created by the use of many types of narrations of punishments apart from the incident of the body hanging. Even the literature and books like, 'What will happen when we die?' created fear and terror.	Malaiat, in the period of the dictator of the time Zia-u-Lhaq, did not show good characteristics of sympathies of Allah, but there is various tortures in the name of religion and more in his writing: "What will be done after death."	ملائيت ضياءالحق his career, is now that you're امريت to God, the qualities of rahimi and karimi to highlight the contrary to the and the name of the religion of the ودہشت fear the atmosphere is set up in this incident, the body apart from their and ' 'after' will be severe also fear giving birth to. 
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.	And these people are only using this fear as a tool or a weapon to gain worldly pleasures and honor.	And such persons use this fear as a way to get the world's respect.	And this is just worldy people tiny amount and dignity and Jalal his intention to as fear or beign used by the equipment.

Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000 in Swat went there to do.	A question raised from BBS if it is not reasonable but alas on the sow thinking of writers,.for example it was asked from any person that for what purpose the force went Swaaat containing 30000 persons.	The question raised by the BBC is substandard; I could only feel pity for the writers. For instance, nobody asked this: What were the 3000 soldiers camping at Swat doing?	The BBC, was asked the question is not enough to write to see the superficialness regret, for example, a question did not present in the Swat 30 thousand army has been to what?

If this war had not happened, then they would all be talking like Pakistan and India.	Were it not for this World War, they'd still be arguing and nagging at each other over small things.	And if there had not been a great war, then they would still be fighting back and forth like Pakistan and India. 
Almost all of our political parties agree on this: terrorists and denominational activities should be ended in this country.	Almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be stopped.	Almost all of our political parties are unified in the idea that terrorism and sectarian violence shall be eradicated from the country.	Almost all our political parties are agreed upon the fact that terrorism and sectarianism should be rooted out of the country. 
But our army rulers don't seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, America and Europe thinks we are with them in this war against terrorism.  But, on the other hand, we also help secretly help the Taliban.	Our military leadership doesn't seem to be sincere in these regards. On the one hand, America and Europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism, and on the other hand we secretly help the Taliban.	However, our own military leadership does not seem to be sincere in this assertion.

There is no doubt that the majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are also members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined  the party named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.	There is no doubt that the majority of the workers of Jama'athud Da'wah are the previous members of Lashkar-e-Taiba who joined the group called Jama'athud Da'wah Pakistan after Lashkar-e-Taiba was rendered inexistent.	There is no doubt that the elements of Jamat-ud-dawa include a majority which belongs to Lashkar-e-Taiba, a banned organization which is now established and operating with a new name: Jamat-ud-dawa Pakistan.	There is no doubt that the majority of the Movement Leagues are from the Tayaba Group, who joined the Leagues after the inception of Pakistan. 
Although these members only did subsidiary activities, after India's great insistence The United Nations has invalidated the group.  The government of Pakistan is also  continuing the crack down against them.	However, after that, the members gave preference to social work.  Even now Jama'athud Da'wah was rendered inexistent by the United Nations due to the pressure applied by India and the crackdown being enforced by the Pakistani government.	However, after more focus was diverted towards humanitarian activities on India's strong request, the United Nations has also banned it. The government of Pakistan has also implemented a crackdown on this organization.	However, afterwards these League obstructed aid campaigns, and now yielding to India's insistence, United Nations have declared them as the enemy and even the Government of Pakistan is cracking down on them. 
In my opinion, it's better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.	I believe that if Jihadi groups leave religious fundamentalism and take up social efforts that would be better.	In my opinion, if these Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and focus on religion and humanitarian assistance, then it is much better.	In my opinion, if these Jihadi groups quit their religious fanaticism and try help the people instead, it would be in the best interest of  all. 
Terrorist groups in Pakistan, support professional criminals and the heads of those are Mullahs who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.	The present terrorist groups that bring up criminals in the name of Jihad, and the elders of these Mullas, are the same people who used to call Pakistan 'Palidistan', and other derogatory terms.	The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan which have used the name of Jihad to induct and nurture professional killers, criminals and their molana's, are the same people who called Pakistan 'Plaeedistan' meaning un clean land. These are the people who make a bad name for Pakistan.	The terrorist organizations operating in Pakistan are employing professional criminals in the name of Jihad.  Their mentors  and the mullahs are the same people who called Pakistan, Paleedistan and what not from time to time. 
And now they are doing everything to destroy Pakistan.	Now they are not leaving any stone unturned in the quest to destroy Pakistan.	Now, they are trying their best to destroy Pakistan.	They are not letting any stone unturned in the way to destruction of Pakistan. 
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called human beings, let alone Muslims.	Actually, these are not even fit to be called human beings, let alone 'Muslims'.	In reality, they aren't even close to being a Muslim. In fact, they deserve to be called animals or barbarians.	They do not deserve to be called humans;  let alone muslims. 
Without cleaning Pakistan of these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.	Without cleaning Pakistan of these mischief mongers, the national security will remain at risk.	Pakistani security will remain at risk until these extremists are eradicated from the country.	Without eliminating these miscreants out of Pakistan, the national security will remain to be at risk. 
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous persons or not?	Can we still think about whether or not to put a ban on these mischief mongers?	Should we still believe that the innocent people will be charged with rules and regulation?	Is there still room to consider whether these scoundrels should be banned? 
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose work is only to kill.	There is no place on earth for extremist Mullah's who only work to cause killings.	In this furious world the job is war, their work is only to kill.	There is no place in this world for extremist mullahs whose only purpose is to kill. 
This news breaks my heart to pieces.	This news tore my heart.	With this news my heart is broken.	Hearts are breaking into pieces over this news. 
What kind of world is this where life is hard for one who takes the name of a major pillar of Islam, the religion of Allah.

Non-Muslims can kill Muslims but when Muslims even try to take revenge, all our hypocritical leaders together with all the non-Muslim world persecute them, just like our great leader Hafiz Saeed is being treated today.	Non-Muslims can kill Muslims, but if a Muslim even tries to extract revenge, along with the whole non-Muslim world, even the hypocrite leaders join and treat those who have sincere religious feeling like our great leaders are treating Hafiz Saeed.	Non-Muslim can kill Muslims, but when Muslims try to take revenge then all non-Muslims along with the whole world think that Islamic preaching is done with Hafiz Sayeed.	Non Muslims can kill Muslims, but if a Muslim even tries to take revenge, along with the whole non Muslim world, our hypocrite leaders  treat those with true and sincere religion just like they are treating our great leader Hafiz Saeed now a days. 
India is in impunity of the Bombay attacks.	After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-Pak relationships turned sour, for the first time suffering a severe setback.	India is very upset about the attack on Mumbai.	As a penalty of Mumbai attacks India.

Citizens of Pakistan have created the misunderstanding between the two countries and in the coming days the situation will worsen.	Pakistani relations are affected, and the recent improvement in relations between the two countries are stopped. 
India has always held the military and non-military groups in Pakistan responsible.	India has always claimed that militant and non-militant groups which are active in Pakistan are responsible.	India always blames the Pakistani terror group.	India continually blames active armed and unarmed groups in Pakistan 
And putting the relationship back on track is being conditioned by operations against these groups.	For the relationships to return to normal, taking action against these countries is being made a prerequisite.	The up coming problems on the taluk ,has  been stoped.	and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the actions against these groups. 
Indian security departments have held Lashkher-e-Tayyaba responsible for the Bombay attacks.	Whereas Indian security agencies have accused Lashkar-e-Taiba of being directly responsible for the Mumbai attacks.	The Indian security centers have blamed them for the attack on Mumbai, saying the Lashkar-e-tayab is responsible.	Whereas Indian Security agencies have directly blamed Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks, . . . 
In this way many times Jamat Ul Dawa's name came up.	The name  Jama'athud Da'wah also comes up many times in this regards.	In this case, the name Jamat-ud-Dawa has popped up many times.	Jamat Adawa has also been nominated.

This is the first time that relationship between both the countries has worsened due to terrorist activity in India.

After that, in 2002 Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned and included on the terrorist list. 
On Jamat-UL-Dawa, on which a security analyst said that this is new face of Lashkar-e-Taiba asking for sanctions.	Now, it is being demanded that Jama'athud Da'wah, which according to security reports is just a new form of Lashkar-e-Taiba, also be banned.	Now Security analysts say Jamat-ud-Dawais is, in reality, the new face of Lashker-e-Tayyaba. Restrictions on the party are being requested.	Now Jamat Adawa, to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of Lashka-e-Taiba, is demanded to be banned. 
What is your suggestion? Should this group be sanctioned or not?	In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?	In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?	What do you think, should this group be banned or not? 
Should Pakistan take action against terrorist group on its land?	Should Pakistan take decisive action against the active fundamentalist groups within its boundaries or not?

The United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions against Jamat Ul Dawa in its last session. What evidence does the Security Council have for its haste?	The Security Council of the United Nations has passed the ban on Jama'athud Da'wah. However, what proof did the Security Council have on which to base such urgency?	The Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all, what proof does the Security Council have to decide this so quickly?	The UN Security Council on the party Al-qaeda banned, the end of the Security Council, what are the evidence seems so hurry? 
Public Tranquility Council will always never show this much of expertness against Muslims?	Does the Security Council always show urgency against the Muslims?	Will the Peace Council ever show any alertness against the Muslims?	Why does The Security Council Against Muslims endorse such activity? 
This we say as Accuser is Weak and witness is Strong!	This is what they call a slow complaint and a fast witness.	When the accuser is lazy the witness is active.	To say that the plaintiff has a mercurial attitude is an understatement! 
If you see India has made itself as a Disappointed Country	If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful state.	If see; India itself has become one useless realm.	India's own government has become a failed government!

Till the time Prophet PBUH, Saints and the Follower has given the respect to the Human beings, With Peace the Religion Islam was advertised a lot and was going on	As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.

Muslims have had success in every land.	Muslims have advanced in every field.	The Muslims also got promoted in every field.	The Muslims have also progressed on war grounds. 
When this beautiful religion came to ordinary people, then divisions arose between Muslims and non Muslims and a new era of tumults and quarrel began. Previously the world was not aware of this.	But when Mullahism rose in popularity in the religion, the people were divided into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.	But when this beautiful Religion rose to the hands of distillation then within the human beings began the difference of religious and disbeliever and the new gateways of pride and prejudice began to open by which the world was unknown before.	When this beautiful anarchy began to erupt out of nowhere, the pagans began their violence and totalitarian policies.

The situation is telling us that the efforts undertaken in the regime of General Ziyaul Haqq, after the previous Soviet Union's interference in Afghanistan to get rid of the armed groups that formed as a result of the resistance that started through American and Saudi funding, and to bring an environment similar to that before 1980 were not successful.

And now I do have a question for you:  Does anything in Islamic, Eastern, or Western philosophy permit killing innocent people including Nimazi (faithful Muslims), workers, and the poor as revenge for American attacks? 
If your answer is no, then you need to correct your point of view.	If the answer is no, then you have instant need of correcting your point of view.	If your answer is in the negative, then you really need to examine your point of view.	If not, then you need to clarify your point of view. 
People were armed because there was a danger of Russia attacking Pakistan after Afghanistan.	People were armed, at that time it was dangerous that Russia will turn toward Pakistan after Afghanistan, therefore people were armed.	The people were armed when there was the fear that Russia would head towards Pakistan after finishing Afghanistan, and that is why they were supplied arms.	People in Pakistan were armed because it was feared that Russia would conquer Afghanistan, and Pakistan would be next. 
Now when the danger is that America can attack Pakistan from the channel of Afghanistan, which was mentioned directly in the presidential campaign by the president himself. Then why should he unarm these people?	Now when there is danger that America will overrun Pakistan through passage of Afghanistan of which American president had said out in his election campaign then why should we unarm these people?	Now, when there is the fear that America will capture Pakistan via Afghanistan,as the American president  mentioned in his presidential address, why should we disarm them now?	Now when the current American President clearly stated that he might attack Pakistan during his presidential campaign, then why should we disarm these people? 
It is because America and India will not have to face any public resistance after defeating the Pakistan army.	Only because America or India army don't have to face any civil resistance after defeating Pakistani army?	Only so that after defeating the American or Indian army, it does not have to face any resistance from the public?	If they defeat the Pakistani Army, America or India do not expect to face any public resistance. 
Yes, if any of them are involved in terrorist activities, then only Pakistan should take action against them.	Yes, if anyone of them is involved in any destructive actions then Pakistan should act against them.	Yes, if any of them are guilty of being involved in any destructive work, Pakistan can take action against them alone.	Yes, if any of them areinvolved in sabotage activities, then the Pakistani government has the responsibility to try him and punish him, if necessary. 
But the sad fact of the matter is that leaders of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba declared India's accusations were correct, and that Pakistan was involved.	But this is more, that government against Lashkar-e-Taiba proves correct by India that Pakistan is involve in that.	But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.	But then it is sad that the Government is favoring Lashkar-e- Taiba, proving Indian words true.  This has made Pakistan look bad.

Even if it is accepted that Lashkar-e-Tayyaba is involved, the blame cannot be placed on the Pakistani Government.	If we accept that Laskaray Taiba is involved, it is still wrong to blame the Pakistani government.	Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.	If it is believed that Lashkar-e- Taiba is bad, then also it is not proper to blame Pakistan government. 
And another question arises, "did these terrorists not have the aid of some government or non-government employee of India"?	And one question is also that this terrorist have a either get support of any Government or Indian government personal?	Another question is that were these terrorists supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?	One more question is that these terrorists have not received any help from either an Indian or Indian Government. 
Are the terrorists born or made only in Pakistan, and not in India or other nations of the world?	Are terrorist's only born and made in Pakistan and not made in India and rest of the world?	Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?	Is it that terrorists are born and brought up only in Pakistan and they don't come from India or any other part of the world? 
As far as Lashkar-e-Tayyaba is concerned, it has no involvement in the recent incidents.	As far as Lashkar-e-Taiba is concerned they are not involved in this recent terror.	As for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the present terrorism is in no way connected to it.	As far as Lashkr-e-Taiba is concerned, the ongoing terrorism is not linked to it. 
It should be kept in mind that Hafiz Saeed was the first Jihadi leader who claimed that the actions of the Taliban were a Fitna.	this has remember that Hafiz Saeed was the first person who called Taliban acts as 'Fitnah'.	It must be remembered that Hafiz Saeed is the first 'Jehadi leader' who called the Taliban actions 'mischief'.	It must be recalled that Hafiz Sayeed was the first 'Militant Leader' who declared activities of Taliban as 'revolt'. 
I believe without a doubt that all the actions of the Taliban were an integral part of the American scheme, therefore it is necessary to eradicate anyone and everyone who stands in the way of the Taliban.	this is my firm believe that Taliban acts was a part of American projects so that every that person and group need to clean out from the way who challenge Taliban in any manner.	I am sure that the Taliban effect is an inseparable result of American plans. Hence, every person who can stand in the way of the Taliban must be removed.	I am quite sure that Taliban agitation is a vital part of American plans. Every person or organization who challenges Taliban in any aspect, must be eliminated. 
Despite the co-operation of the entire nation, launching an operation under the pressure of India shows the stature and non-existant leadership qualities of Zerdari and company.	even support by whole nation, take action against Lashkar due to Indian pressure indicate Zardindco frustration and butter up nature.	Despite the support of the whole nation, the fact that Zardari took action against the Lashkar is a clear sign of frigid and sycophant nature.	Despite the cooperation of the whole nation, Pakistan Government's  action against Lashkar-e-Taiba at the behest of pressure from India, indicates the nervousness and ficklness of Zardari and Co. 
The operations started with American and Saudi funding, and has to come to an end. To do so, it should be requested of them to wipe out this filth that is consistently polluting our society.	Americans said to end this campagin which started from Saudi's funding. Ask them now to clean this dirt as well, which make our society polluted.	To stop the project that is running on Saudi-American funding, they must be requested themselves to regather, for God's sake, the filth that has polluted our society.	To terminate the expedition started by the funding of America and Saudi Arabia, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society. 
And also protest against them asking them based on what ethics, America and Saudi spread dangerous weapons and so called Jihadi, but in reality hate inciting and cultural virus enticing literature in our country, because of which our country has become a human slaughterhouse.	One should also protest against them that according to ethics, America and Saudi Arabia distributed dangerous weapons and named Jihadis, but in reality spread the virus of hateful literature and culture due to which slaughter houses were opened in our country.	we will protest against them that in which ethical way America and Saudia has distributed dangerous weapons and so called Jihad but actually they have distributed hatred literature and cultural virus which has created a human slaughter houses.	Also question why American and Saudis sell dangerous arms and so called Jihadi but in fact the virus of loathsome literature and culture, due to which human butcher houses established in our country. 
After facing the risk of attack from India, the Pakistani Army's announcement that it would remove forces from the Afghan border and post them at the Indian border, and the announcement of the Taliban that it would handle the Afghan border, caused America to stumble, and pressurize India not to attack Pakistan.	After the threat of attack from India, the announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan, and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly and tried its best to convince India that she should attack Pakistan.	After the threat from India to attack Pakistan, the Pakistan military announces that it will pull its forces from the Afghan border and put them towards India. The Taliban also announced that they will take care of the Afghan border, which resulted in chaos in America and it forced India not to go to war with Pakistan.	After the threat of an attack from the Indian side, the Pakistan Army announced that they would pull their troops from the Afghan Border and would commit them towards India.  The Taliban declaredthat they would take care of the Afghan Border.  This staggered the Americans badly, and thus they put all their weight behind Pakistan against an Indian attack. 
This showed the strength of America in the region.	This shattered the confidence of America in the area.	In this letter all the firepower of American was exposed.	This exposed the weakness of the American Army in the region. 
India did not warn that they would attack, and nor do they have the courage to do so.	Although India did not even threaten nor does it have the guts to.	in contrast India has never threatened nor it has the power to attack	Although India neither made any threat of an attack nor dared to do so. 
The Taliban attacked and destroyed most of the remaining American supplies.	And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of the Taliban on American posts.	The remaining damage is done by the Taliban attacking the American convoy.	In addition, attacks of Taliban on the American supply lines proved to be the final nail in the coffin. 
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and the Pakistani government, America is nothing.	Thus it was proven that without the support of Pakistan and its army, America can do nothing.	This proved that, without the Pakistan military and government support, America is nothing.	Thus, it was proved that without the help of Pakistan's Government and Army, America would achieve nothing.

Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty-handed, but ever since law and order in the western border regions was lost, everybody diverted their attention here.	Hundreds of thousands do not return empty-handed from here. But since the law was enforced on the western borders, Karachi has taken all the attention.	Millions never returned from here, but when the law and order situation in western areas worsens then all the attention is directed towards Karachi.	Hundreds of thousand never return with empty pockets from here, but since the grip of law has weakened in Western Frontier areas, all eyes are on Karachi.

For the first time, Pathans began to be called Pukhtons, and the people of a single town are made foreigners and are being made to fight, while the need is for unity.	For the first time Pathan's are called Pashtoons. They are made to fight by making them strangers to each other, although the need is to be united.	For the first time, Pathans are called by Pakhtuns, which is making the city's people act like strangers and fight among each other. To be united is a necessity of the time.	First time Pathans are named Pakhtoon, and residents of a city are fighting like strangers, although we need to stay united. 
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speakers learn Pashto, or the Pashto speakers learn Urdu, or maybe it's better for everybody to learn English.	One possible solution to the problem is this that either Urdu speaking learn Peshto or Peshto speaking learn Urdu, or what's better is they all learn English.	One solution to this problem is that either the Urdu speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun speaking people learn Urdu, or better yet, both learn English.	One solution to the problem is if the Urdu speaking people learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu. If everyone learns English it is better.

Sir, in my childhood I actually gave the same suggestion many times to my friends, which included people from all religious and political groups, but people used to laugh at those suggestions.

Sir, during my childhood, I really gave this suggestion on numerous occasions to my friends of all ethnic and religious groups; every time people laughed at it. 
At that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not as apparently alive and powerful on the surface but they were boiling inside.	At that time the condition of Jinna of hatred of dialectal and religious was not that alive and strong but it was brewing internally.	At that time, the religious and linguistic hate which was not as lively and strong as they are today were still developing within.	At that time, these ethnic and religious sentiments of hatred were not so strong, they were merely boiling inside.

Governments in power will typically change the names of airports, major roads and buildings, which is the case today  as infrastructure projects are renamed in memory of Baynazeer.	When the government comes, they just change names of the places to build a name for themselves. These days, airports, roads, and buildings are all named Benazir.	Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.	Every blossoming government starts to  change the names of places in the country. For example, airport, roads, and buildings are all named Benazir.

While the Mumbai attack was on peak, the initiative taken by RAW(Indian spy agency)to start sectarian violence was busted.  This event proves that in past, political figures on RAW's payroll have now given up the job.	When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of the RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.	At the height of the Mumbai attacks, the fact that the efforts to cause mischief on linguistic and racial lines in Karachi failed is proof that those politicians working on racial parole have resigned from their jobs.	In accordance with the Mumbai attack,  it has been said that the the task in Karachi has failed; and those who performed these tasks should resign. 
Pakistani's from Karachi to Khyber have been awakened because of the spilling of innocent blood of Pushto-speaking people and persistent threats from India.

The Indians in the Karachi should be aware that the laborers are speaking improperly. 
All strict applause of anger from political, religious, sectarian and national bodies, is now teaching India the manners of diplomatic speech. They have provided American strategists a chance to think again.	While the patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties has taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time it has also given American planners one more chance to think.	The identical country loving reaction of all the political, religious, linguistic and national parties has not only taught India the manners of diplomacy, but it has also given the American policy makers a chance to think again.

Those responsible for the turmoil in Karachi are Mutahida and Awami National Party, ANP , as the establishment is inclined towards one party and not neutral.	The MQM and the ANP are responsible for the turmoil in Karachi, and the government is only interested in itself.

But alas, that if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there, but since its not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.	And the sad thing is that if such a situation was prevalent in any border town, the government would take care of that place. But since this is far from the border, the government looks helpless.	The saddest part is if this kind of situation occurred in some city in Sarhad, the government would have done something, but if it is not in Sarhad, the government would be so helpless.

Placing in front of us the heart-rending attacks on Bombay, we certainly do not have to dive deep to find the reasons for this disturbance in Karachi. There is one simple and easy reason that this disturbance caused the of spilling of blood.	Keeping the heart rendering Mumbai attacks in view and diving to search for a cause for the violence in Karachi is not at all needed.  Rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in 'blood'.	Keeping in mind the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in Karachi. It is simple and easy to guess that the turmoil is just due to an unconscious trade of blood.

Consequences of noises.	Ijaz Awan	Ejaz Aiwan	Ijaz Awan 
Many of us who live in large towns and cities have grown used to working in noise which comes from several different sources. There is the noise of moving trains, which is heard at almost all hours of the day,	Sir, before you convince a large number of people with your proposals, I shall tell you that the signs of this mischief are also found on the walls of Karachi, in the form of posters and wall chalking.	Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the graffiti of real gangsters these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.	Before you gather a crowd of people giving suggestions overnight,I have to tell you that we can find true evidence of real misbehaviour on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalkings and posters. 
The Jet planes that fly over head produce noise of even greater loudness and intensity.	We have been seeing both types of mischief.	We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.	We have been seeing both kinds of misbehaviour. 
Many people have no time to think of noises as one type or another.	Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan alone. They did not have to face any reaction.	These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan. They did not face any reaction.	By the way, vandals did not tolerate the newly created Pakistan and its founder. But they have never experienced any reaction. 
They become part of our daily lives.	Quite the opposite, they are pecking at the heart of Pakistan.	On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.	In return, creating problems for the same country, Pakistan. 
There is something to be thought of, does noise affect our lives in any harmful ways?	There used to be one Muslim League.  They made the rough version of the 18th amendment and handed it over to the People's Party.	One Muslim League N was left. Even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to the People's Party.	Only the Muslim League (N) was left; she also handed over the draft of the 18th amendment to the Peoples Party. 
There is evidence that it does so in several ways.  It has been recognized for a long time to do such.	Before that, MQM and Muslim League (q) had already handed in rough versions of the 18th amendment to the national assembly and senate.	Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment to the National Assembly and the Senate.	Before this MQM and the Muslim League (Q) has already submitted the draft of the 18th amendment in the Assembly and the Senate. 
Exposure to high intensity noise can lead to loss of hearing.  There have been cases of boiler-makers, for example, who suffer from occupational deafness.	It still seems that the copy of the 18th amendment is a political trickery, and no one is sincere about accepting that amendment.	Until now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment are a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.	Now, it appears that the 18th amendment was a political move and none of the party is sincere in its approval. 
More recently it has also been found that people who are continuously exposed to other loud noises require protection of the ear.	This is why no fuss was made in the assembly or on the floor of senate over this amendment and the parliament was not forced into accepting the amendment.	This is the reason why  no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.

It looks like America's work has been increased in Pakistan and one or more Authorities are working on it or they might not believe that person as compared to the first one.

According to the government, tactics along with force, and discussions have been going on.	Till now, according to the Government Policy, cross talks are  going along together with the use of power.	Traditionally both roles were played by psychiatrists, who not only counseled patients, but prescribed them drugs.	The government’s policy so far is to engage in talks rather than the use of force. 
But the use of force is only causing the Taliban to increase their own use of force while gaining more of the public's favor.	But the use of force is resulting in increased support and sympathy for the Taliban among people not receiving any benefit from it.

The government should eliminate the cause of the problem rather than use brute force.	The government must, instead of using the power, eliminate the causes of the issue.

Fazalullah and the Taliban will dissolve into nothingness if the root causes are terminated.	With the root causes addressed, Fazalullah and Taliban will die out by themselves.

But besides implementation of the Sharia, the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues.	In addition to the observance of the Shariat law, the administration will take care of the well being of the people.	However, the government must address the financial problems in addition to the implementation of Shariat. 
From General Musharraf's initial few steps, it looked as if the nation would be freed of useless politicians.  But the love for power changed all his plans.	At the beginning of General Musharaf rise, it looked like the nation had rid itself of the incompetent politicians, but the lust for power changed all his plans.	The actions of General Musharaf led us to believe that we had been freed from the unqualified politicians of the land but, his ambition for more power changed everything.

General Musharraf, the army had to control, but the present Government not only to what is the. 
Whether in Bajod or Swat, the army cannot control terror.  Instead they bomb the 'enemy', i.e. the public.

In Bajor or Swat the army does not control terror but bombs the "Enemy" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy out to be mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy?	The army could not put down the terror in Baajodoh and Swat.

Karachi: Our ministers have to understand that, the members of the operation that they are carrying are the people who respect us and after much damage they also love us.	from Karachi says: Our leaders should understand that the people they are targeting by their military operations are the ones who are actually the true patriots, who are enduring all types of cruelty but continue to love Pakistan more than their own lives.	Our leaders in Karachi should understand this-that the people they are doing the operation against are the true valuers of Pakistan. They are tolerating all kinds of tortures but they love Pakistan.	Our rulers should understand that they are fighting their own people who are willing to bear the hardships for thier love for Pakistan. 
			If a war occurs, then they will fight for Pakistan.
