Abstain From Dieting To Avoid Flu
This finding by American scientists resulted from experimentation on rats.
It was demonstrated in these experiments that rats on low-calorie diets had lessened ability to resist the flu virus.
Research has proven the old myth  of fasting during fever wrong.
According to the scientists, one should eat a lot when one has a fever.
The researchers from the Michigan State University say that the rats on a diet had less power to resist the infection and their chances of dying had increased, whereas rats on a normal diet had better resistance against the flu virus.
In many modern countries it is sometimes fashionable to think that, by free education for all-whether rich or poor, clever or stupid- one can solve all the problems of the society.
But we can already see that free education for all is not enough. We find in such countries a far larger number of people with University degrees than there are jobs for them to fill.
The Plan of Education Implemented in 1990.
Because of their degrees, they refuse to do what they think low work and in fact work with the hands is thought to be dirty and shameful in such countries.
The work of a completely uneducated farmer is far more important than that of a professor: we can live without education, but we die if we have no food. If no one cleaned our streets and took the rubbish away from our houses, we should get terrible diseases in our towns.
In fact, when we say that all of us must be educated to fit us for life, it means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited.
Education is not an end but a means to an end. In other words we do not educate children only for the purpose of educating them.
When men become organized into very large groups, a civilization develops.
It is possible to get freedom from hunger, thirst, cold, heat and many diseases, so that each person can live a happier life than he could.
It means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited to his brain and ability, and secondly, that we can realize that all jobs are necessary to society and that is very bad to be ashamed of ones work or to scorn someone else.
He said further that in May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with care, and Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.
When Thomas Reed was asked if China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan, he replied that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.
He said that there is evidence that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan has used the Chinese model. Later the documents received from Libya also confirm this.
Another question that is it common to do nuclear experiments mutually. Then he said that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.
He said that we also predicted that Israel has access to the results of this experiment.
Thomas Reeds was also asked if China was continuing nuclear proliferation.
On this Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and the design to an Iranian nuclear facility in Asfahan.
Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.
He said that China had been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Rome, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen via North Korea.

Protest against the removal of journalists
On Tuesday, the organization of journalists, RIUJ, held protests in front of the Islamabad Press Club of Journalists and Newspaper Workers against media owners and the government about the news channel and newspapers removing many of their employees.
Speaking to the protesters, a senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, the Federal Union of Journalists,  C.R. Shamsi said, "The politicians who protested with us yesterday on the streets, today, have become rulers and are sitting in Parliament. Out of fear of a certain lobby of media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of journalists."
He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.
An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.
He said that there should be firm measures taken against the TV and newspaper owners, and the journalists should establish a protest camp in front of Parliament to fight for their rights.
C.R. Shamsi criticized the governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, saying that employees were removed from his Urdu Newspaper "Aaj Kal" staff without prior notice.
Whereas Junah Daily, Khabrein Daily, Channel 5, Burns Plus TV and Aaj TV have removed dozens of workers.
Speaking to the protestors, the General Secretary of PUFJ said that today, throughout the country, journalist organizations are observing a black day against the removal of journalists and newspaper workers, whereas journalists will go to the parliamentary session wearing black bands on their arms to get back their rights.
According to Mazhar Abbas, in 50% of the Pakistani newspapers and TV channels the workers and journalists were being exploited, where they work without any agreement.
He said that until now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been removed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is being feared that the owners will remove hundreds more in the present year, making an excuse of the present financial crisis.
Mazhar Abbas has said that the journalists' movement will continue unless the dismissed workers are restored. Implementation of the seventh wage board responsible of determining the wages of employees of news papers and release of salaries of TV channels and newspaper employees has been blocked for many months.

3.5 Million Users Affected by Virus
Discovered for the first time in October 2008, this virus is known by names like Confecker, Down and Up, and Kido.
Microsoft had released a patch to tackle this virus; but, despite that, almost 3.5 million computers and memory sticks have been affected with it.
The experts say that the number of affected computers can be a lot more.
To handle this, the users need to use Microsoft's MS08067 patch.
According to Microsoft, this virus which infected millions of computers, locates the services.exe file in Windows and then gets into its code.
After that, the virus turns into a DLL file in the Windows System folder.
It also create a name for this file as well.
Then it changes the registry details of Windows.
After getting activated, this virus creates a problem which rises as an http server and changes the restore point of the system.
Afterwards, it downloads the files from the maker's website.
According to Microsoft, this virus has infected computers in different countries of the world.
These countries include China, Brazil, Russia, India, America and Britain.
The advantages of such an agreement are great.
By his own nature as a man; this is my attack him, and death will certainly come to him sooner or later.
One man may become a doctor if he knows that others will grow food, make clothing or build houses.
When men become organized in civilization, it is possible to be freed from hunger, thirst, cold, and heat.
He can live happily with the others.
A man living alone in a desert or forest is free from other people; but he is not absolutely free.
His freedom is limited in several ways. Firstly, by the things around him such as wild animals or steep cliffs.
second, by his own needs: he must have sleep, water, food and shelter from extreme heat or cold.
When men live together, on the other hand, protection against wild animals is easier and they can work together to get food and build shelters; but each man has to give up some of his freedom.
I agree to respect the rights of others and in return they agree to respect mine.
In reply to a question, he said that law enforcement agencies in India took 42 days to gather information about the guilty people in the Mumbai incident, so we hope that India, along with the global community, will give Pakistan some time to verify this information.

Let it be known that a three member investigation team has been formed in the leadership of the Additional Director General of the FIA. The information about the Mumbai attacks given by India
to Pakistan is being verified by this team.
The High Commissioner of Pakistan in India, Shahid Malik, met President Asif Ali Zardari, in which meeting the president made it clear that if any Pakistani group or individual is found guilty in the Mumbai attacks, action will be taken against them according to the country law, and no one would be handed over to India. This, when the Indian government is continuously pressuring Pakistan to hand over the guilty people to India.

He said that Martin Luther King spent his life serving the people.
Barack Obama said today we are honoring his memory. This is not a day to just pause and think, it is a day to act.
He said that the swearing-in ceremony on Tuesday will have the same spirit as in 1963, when many people gathered to hear the "I have a dream" speech of Martin Luther King.
During that speech, Martin Luther King said that a day will come when no discrimination will be made on the basis of one's skin color.
BBC's Matthew Price pointed out that it is a strange historical coincidence that Martin Luther King Day should fall on the day before the first black president of the U.S. will take his oath.

Azam Suwati is an independent candidate and was elected a senator and is one of the richest senators.
Moulana Ata-ur-Rahman is a member of the National Assembly and is also Moulana Fazal-ur-Rahman's younger brother.

Bolochistan, Blasted Pipeline
According to police, this is a 18-inch diameter pipeline which connects different wells of Parekoh and meets the Suyi gas pipeline. This was blasted by unidentified men in the early morning.
Apart from this, yesterday, well number 3 near Suyi had been totally destroyed by a blast and a gas pipeline near Dera-allayar was also damaged due to a blast.
Militant organization Baloch republican army's spokeperson, Saryaz Baluch, accepted the responsibility for these blasts on the behalf of his organization.
At the beginning of 2009, there was an increase in violent incidents in Baluchistan.
This month, until now, several gas pipelines have been blasted.  Attacks on trains and on people belonging to the Punjab region have also increased.
Even though the Prime Minister of Baluchistan, Nawab Aslam Rayisani, has expressed concern over such activities and ordered the police to exchange information with intelligence agencies, stopping such incidents has not yet been possible.
$819 billion economic revival package approved
No member of the Republican party voted in favor of President Obama's plan.
Members of the Republican Party said that the economic plan is very expensive and will not prove effective.
240 votes were cast in favor of this package in the members assembly whereas 160 were cast against it.
This economic revival plan will be presented next week in the Senate where the ruling Democratic party has very little majority.
Concern is being expressed that great opposition from the Republican Party may make it difficult to obtain Senate approval.
After the approval of the economic revival plan by the members assembly, Barrack Obama told the members that this important plan should not get caught in the middle of political disagreement.
The president said that this plan, which hoped would be enacted by next month, will prove to make a peaceful atmosphere in the country and enhance the American economy.
With this plan, taxpayers and and businesses will be relieved of $275 billion in loans, $540 billion dollars will be put toward roads and bridges projects, 10,000 schools, unemployment benefits, and research for new technology.
BBC writer Richard Luster has said in Washington that Barack Obama intended to introduce a new political culture by eliminating political disagreements, but discussion about this economic package has once again made politicians sore.
Republican party members in the assembly declared the bill proposed by the government a waste of government money, and they said that this will not help in creating new jobs.
They insisted on the bill proposed by their party in which attention has been given to reduced taxes.
They said that their package can create more jobs at less cost.
They said that instead of construction plans, reduced taxes can create more jobs instantly.
Bitterness between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Rajab Tayyab Erdogan almost shouted at Israeli President and said that the blood of many people has been shed in Gaza. He felt sorrow watching that people can actually applaud this military action from Israel.
Mr. Erdogan said "I think you are using such words to erase your guilt and that in a high voice. But you killed people and I am remembering those children who were killed near the shore."
Shamoon Parez said that Gaza's pain is not Israel, it is Hammas who has founded dangerous dictatorship there.
A correspondent of BBC from Davis says that nothing like this has been seen before in an international economic forum.
Although later Erdogan said that he respects the Israeli president and also his age, due to which he did not shout at him, but what he was saying was miles away from truth.
Turkey is one of the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, but for the last few years there has been tension between them.
The attacks were not planned in Pakistan.
Speaking to Indian news channel NDTV, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said that the report of the Pakistani investigations into the Mumbai blast will be prepared soon.
In the attacks that took place in Mumbai last Novemeber, more than 170 people were killed.
India claims that extremist group Lashkar-e-Taiba is responsible for the attacks.
India also said that Pakistani 'state factors' were guilty in the Mumbai attacks.
After the Mumbai attacks, the relations between the two countries were affected.
High commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan gave his first statement about the report of the Pakistani investigations, from which it becomes evident as to what is within the report.
Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that as far as the investigation has gone, Pakistani land has not been used.
It must be some other place, not England.
These were the two places (Pakistan and Britain), about which I was in doubt.
India and the global brotherhood has put considerable pressure on Pakistan to take action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan says that it has arrested dozens of people during the action against groups which were clearly involved in the Mumbai attacks.
Wahid Shamsul Hasan said, "We are not trying to cover this up."
We believe in acting upon facts.
Our investigations will be accepted by the world.
We will try to satisfy India with the results (of the investigation).
Defending the delay in the Pakistani investigations, he said that to gather, understand and verify such matter takes time.
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that India took 45 days to hand over its dossier.
Black person chosen as Republican leader as well.
In the sixth round of elections of the Republican party, Michael Steele,who got 91 votes out of 168, won.

They both know each other since they had stood in election for the seat in Sant.
But after the interference from Sant, he has been elected as chairman of Political conservant committee.

National Conference's allied party Congress also informed the Governor about their support for Umer Abdullah.
Umer Abdullah will take the oath tomorrow as Chief Minister.

The European Union's role in Peace in the Middle East
Looking it from the government's point of view, the efforts by the European Union to stop the war in the Middle East have been decisive.
According to the Brussels official position, the Shoarzan Berg Group or Sarkozy's efforts are symbolic to the seriousness of the matter.
European Commission's Spokesman Amadeu Altafa said, "Every effort is commendable that can help a unified message from the European Union to reach the warring sides."
In light of the government's statement all seems to be fine.
However, in reality, the European Union is presenting a view of conflict amongst each other, an idea that is very sad.
The role of the Czech Republic's president is already very weak.
In addition, the internal turmoil has nullified the effect.
On the other hand, the French President's role seems to indicate he is still working as the president of the European Union.
Despite the fact that France's 6-month presidential term has ended.
Sarkozy wants to play a leader's role, a job he can do well, but he lacks the authorization to do it.
The most funny situation is faced by the French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner.
He is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of the Czech Republic, Schwarzenberg.
The problem is both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements about war in the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense, whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. Moreover, Germany has sent its special ambassador to the Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.
The proof for this is,  Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.
This is a golden chance for the European Union to do something since America, due to the policies of George W. Bush, has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial Crisis: Suicide of Billionaire German Industrialist.
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany, left a huge business group behind him.
But, a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 million to one billion euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle was under intense pressure.
Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had gone from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic power.
After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quickly, putting it on a new track.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm,the  Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel Group around the world is near 100,000, and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical company Ratiopharm, always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the management of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks sanctioned 400 million euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it can improve its financial conditions in the long term.
Therefore, after Adolf Merkeley's demise, the Merkeley Group came to an end.
According to new statistics, the crime rate among the immigrants in Germany,
if compared with other countries, between 2004 and 2007
dropped from 22.9%
to 21.4%
In the view of Joachim Herrmann, the Minister for Home Affairs of Bavaria, it has been a positive change.
He said: "It is to be noted that the number of aspirants seeking German citizenship has increased."
The statistics would have shown the fact that most of the criminals were German citizens.
Based on this, a foreigner said when statistics of crime are taken in his homeland in 2010, the above mentioned factors will be taken for consideration by Herrmann.
Mentions have been made in his letters about Humberg except Baaveria.
Christoph Ahlhaus, an internal affair's senator belonging to the CDU said, "When one does research in a scientific manner, then the results can not be predetermined. The results are based on the figures and numbers which are the outcome of the research."
Ahlhaus brought the attention towards an analysis report of 2006 prepared by a regional (provincial) office of Crime Prevention, in view of which it was calculated that in the crimes happening from bergdorf to hamburg, what is the percentage of foreigners involved.
From the results it was found out that the foreigners
crime percentage is less compared to the overall crime rate of the whole province.
In contrast to this calculation, when in 2006 in Berlin, the teenage crime rates were analyzed, it was found that the teenagers having a foreign background was 7.44%
was 7.44 %
However, certain political parties of Germany for example SPD the environmentalist party, The Greens, and the Left party Linkspartei (Die Linke) , are against the idea of collecting information about whether certain German citizens are foreigners or not, while collecting facts about crimes and crime rates.

Israel is committing massacre by slaughtering children, women and common people and America's President is praising him. This is the humanity and freedom the America that the world is witnessing in Gaza and other parts of the world.

Meanwhile, Afghan and international forces have said that between Wednesday and Thursday night, they have killed at least 28 militants during fights across Afghanistan.
NATO said that its armies had killed 22 soldiers in land and air strikes in the Western province of Khost, near the Pakistani border.

Tea: Effective cure of Chest Cancer
New research indicates that drinking 3 cups of tea everyday
reduces the danger of breast cancer in women under 50 years of age by 1/3rd.
Research at the Moffitt Cancer Center in the American State of Florida, has showed that chances of getting chest cancer in those women under 50 years of age
who drink at least three cups of tea everyday is reduced by 37%.
The research study also claims that it does not help older women even if they drink three or more cups of tea daily.
Specialists think that this is because of the presence of such components in tea that are more effective against the types of cancer tumors which usually target women under 50 years of age.
Research was done on 5000 women who had treatment done for chest cancer at Moffitt Cancer Center, founded in Tampa, Florida.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
Specialists compared their medical records and lifestyles to those women who were free of breast cancer.
Specialists also came to know that tea had its prominent effect on one kind of cancer, Lobes, and it was reduced by 66%.
One on every ten breast cancer patients has this kind of cancer.
This type of chest cancer is dangerous because it is deep inside and usually diagnosed when it has spread a lot.
Specialists found that having at least three cups of tea every day can readily reduce the chances of breast cancer in women of younger ages.
They say that incorporating tea as a regular drink in your daily routine helps create immunity against the cancer.
Almost 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in Britain.
War in Afghanistan is the greatest army challenge facing America- Gates.

Gates told the Senate Armed Services committee that fighting is not the only solution to the Afghanistan issue. But he added that in order to secure several areas, sufficient numbers of troops are not deployed, and the Taliban take advantage of that to continue their operations.
Why Reduce Exercise With Age?
New Research
Exercise at any age is good for health.
It energizes your heart, reduces cholesterol levels, helps in keeping weight low, helps to prevent diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer's or dementia.
Unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.
experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active, however, age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.
Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.
She led a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.
The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the workings of the heart.
The pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.
The experts focused on the left part of the heart, which is the main part for pumping blood.
They learned that as people grow old, there is an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.
Dr. Patricia says that as age increases the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear and this affects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garwin  Cain was also a part of this study.
He says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this. And this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.
If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart they can achieve the benefits of exercise, despite the increase in age.
A detailed report of this has been published in the magazine of the American Medical Association.
"No chance of immediate war with Pakistan" says Indian Army Chief.
The chief of the Indian Army, General Deepak Kapoor has stated that there are no chances of immediate war with Pakistan. However, to serve the country and protect its interests, the Indian Army is always ready.
General Kapoor has made the accusation that despite ascertainments and the international pressure on Pakistan due to the Mumbai attacks, the terrorist's structure is not only the same in Pakistan, but it is also active.
He said this in an interview to journalists in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day trip to the Kashmir valley to inspect the situation of the overall security situation in Kashmir, which is under New Delhi's management, and to check the preparations of the armed forces at the border.
He was asked what his reaction was to the media reports which state that Pakistan refuted the proof presented by India about the Mumbai attacks.
He stated that the matters of peace and war are decided by the political leadership.
Talking about terrorism in the land of Pakistan, he allegedly said that India will fight against the forces that are trying to destroy peace and weaken India.
He said that there are around 700 to 800 fighters present in Indian Kashmir, of whom almost 50% are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that only with the betterment in the weather, the efforts of encroachment between Pakistan and Kashmir under its government can be increased.  Although India has increased security on the borders.
They have refused the possibility of reduction in the number of army soldiers in Indian Kashmir by stating that one can't compromise over the country's security.
May God answer the world's prayers and may Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan are effected by this change.
What will Mr. Barrack Obama give to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams?
The oath taking of Obama as the president of America, whose part of the name is also Hussain, is where historically important in all the ways, is also a great challenge for the history.
Not only for his own self but also for those who supported him with all their hearts.
It will also be challenging be for the white majority as it is not easy for them to accept that a colored man is ruling over them.
Those here in South Asia, especially the Muslims, who have hopes about him should remember that he was elected the president of America, and Obama should remember that the president of America is actually the president of the world.
A little while from then, a person whose real brothers were brought to America from their own countries, wearing the neckband of slavery,and whose blood and sweat watered the roots of the strongest country of the new era, today the a representative of that very same targeted lineage will be called the 44th President.
Many people have many expectations from this man.
It is necessary for those who admire him not to have unrealistic expectations for him.
If Obama is even successful in somewhat reducing the hate that is spread on lineage and religion-based lines, it will be a victory for his admirers.
What effect will this change have on South Asia, and what considerable change can be expected in the American policy in this regard?
How will these changes affect Pakistani-American relations?
?
Sir, whether it be Obama or someone else, the type of policies with regards to the whole world are decided by the multi-billionaire, influential, strong Jewish lobby.
As for Pakistan, with regards to the recent Mumbai blasts, the injurious actions taken by India, Israel and America has been seen by the whole world.
Even after the creation of Pakistan the governance of Swat was in the hands of its King who had his own army and law.
With the help of an agreement they transferred the administration of Swat to the Pakistani government.
But it's disheartening to know that our government treated Swat like a step mother would treat another's child.
After the end of the governance of the King, there were no more schools founded in Swat.
Also, the areas development was not given any notice either.
Currently, the number of girls acquiring education is far less than in previous years.
The Taliban continue their attacks on educational institutions in the NWFP.
Swat has suffered the highest number of schools destroyed, and the majority of them have been all girls schools.
To make matters worse, the Taliban has also announced a ban on education for girls.
Thousands of students are being deprived of education.
what do you think, by stopping girl's education, what the Taliban want to achieve?
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities until today?
What actions do you think the government should take to stop these illegal activities.
the question should be that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
because the people of Swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them, otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that during the Curfew. How come people can be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing.
When the writ of the government is not being carried out and enforced, how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities?
now the question arises that having an armed force, armed with modern weapons, modern technologies and intelligence system, why the government can not control these few Taliban.
The only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head, that neither their arms can reach nor they are apprehended.
The result of the discussion is that the Taliban with their wrong steps are making it easier for the imperialists.
fifteen years before the war was continued in Afghanistan.
ISI used to control the Taliban when there was opposition from the Northern Alliance, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then, suddenly, the situation changed and the Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of Dollars from America, so the previous friend became an enemy.
Now the situation has changed, but the war is still going on and the countries supporting them in Pakistan are still Russia, India, and Iran.
Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.
For instance, if a thief realizes when he goes to steal on object that stealing is wrong-- that it is a curse and it will bring punishment-- and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, it will receive punishment for that and will continue to play with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings
The question is whether war, armed resistance and terrorism are the solutions to the problem?
If not, then what is the magic recipe that will bring out a solution to the problems?
This war is not right. It is destructive and increase our problems rather than solve it.
Palestine, Afghanistan, and Iraq should adopt practices used by Nelson Mandela in South Africa in order to gain independence.
These nations, should fight more for social, ethical, and subjective change, rather than armed resistance.
kashmiri's participation in election shows that they have accepted his point.
Israeli attacks have gone on in Gaza for 3 weeks, and the death toll has reached 1000.
World diplomacy efforts still to this day have not resulted in a cease fire.
an according to a survey , after the dec. 27 attacks, 90,000 Palestine left their homes and moved to a safer place.
on the other hand, NGOs has accused Israel for not taking care of Palestinian children and added that these children will have serious phsycological and emotional problems.
What have you to say??
what do you think should to be done?
How is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Taliban should be given a chance.
basit, Peshawar
Please wake up! If the Taliban started doing the real Jihad, then who will kill the innocent people?
Who will burn down the girls' schools?
Who will do kidnapping for ransom.  If the ransom is not paid, who will blame people of being American agents and hang them on the towers?
These Taliban members have brought more damage to Islam than any nation or religion has ever brought.
Pashtoon Rore
Kohat, Pakistan
If the whole Muslim world just give a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see  how upset its father, America, will be.
And immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well.
But what can be done? Where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from?
Someone should tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step since he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
The responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on Arab and the Muslim worlds but its the obligation of the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny.
This unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
Just like in Pakistan and India, before the 30th of June or the end of the fiscal year the government institutions are looted. The American regime, just before its end, had given a green light to Israel to do whatever it wants.
On one hand, America says that efforts will be made for a ceasefire.
On the other hand, the United Nation is passing one resolution after another but both have done nothing practically. This means that united nation is also working  to crush the Muslims.
All the Islamic Countries should cancel their membership in United Nations and lay the foundation of their own international organization.
There are many examples of promises and resolutions by America and the United Nations where only the Muslims suffered.
What is the advantage of these actions when BBC does not have to print anything?
Where have the principles of journalism been buried?  When the blood starts flowing, especially of Muslims, the ghost of unbiased reporting starts riding over the BBC.
Otherwise portrays itself as the flag bearer of righteousness.
Saying something from their side is a far away thing when they do not even want comments.
For the Muslims.
The difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and Martyr the Muslims, while people like you live among Muslims, calling yourselves Muslims.
[syja786]
Long time since, in the forums of BBC, a specific cult has been targeted sometimes in suicide attacks and sometimes in terrorism occurring in India
Extremism is the favorite word for those anti-islamic comments.
But by viewing the above comment, you can easily differentiate who is the actual extremist, in which almost a Fatwa of blasphemy has been pronounced for writing against Iran.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal cannot be fought with the help of sword?
After watching Israel's bombings on unarmed people, what would one's tear-filled heart do?
But the actual blame should go to that terrorism and violence, which we state as Jihad and ruin the beautiful name of Islam.
Since the majority of Palestinians have already accepted the existence of Israel, does it make sense for Hamas to fire rockets on Israel or send in suicide bombers?
Behavior from both sides lack humanity.
The character played by America and United Nations again showed us their support for the cruelties of Israel.
May Allah grant us, the Muslims, a way to re-unite. Amen.
And the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism.  After all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are.
So in this situation, in common terms, it is called DADAGEERI, which means: do whatever you can.
It hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry.
There are medicines for injured, and coffins for the dead. They are being supplied by the Arab leaders.
Should the Israeli attacks take place?
This is the actual problem that the leaders of Muslim countries including Saudi crownprince are in a false sleep, neither they have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
They should take immediate measures against Israel.
For example, stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Salam to all brothers and sisters!
i think at this hard time advising hammas to stop struggling in the name of peace would be injustified with thousands of widows and millions of orphans, and it would be similar to prove them wrong.
If Israel and its followers are at the peak of cruelty then soon a revolution to stop all this is going to happen, because this is the law of nature. America and Israel's steps are bringing up suicide bombers.
They cannot understand who are blind in the trance of power.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Now Hammas and Israel should befriended to stop blood shed.
Muhammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France.
very rightly said.
Assuming Hammas is 100% right and by fighting against malice it gets higher place in the eyes of God, even then, at least, they should realize if by good deeds, peace in others home is shattered, then that act is no longer a good deed.
Those who claim to love God, His Prophet(P.B.U.H) and their religion, to love humanity is part of their belief.
Consequently, after muslims confiscation of everybody on earth is Allah's order.
Najibur Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
There are no orders to destroy them, but they are invited to come to Islam.
Jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion.
These people should be fought against unless they stop these conspiracies. This doesn't mean that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering.
Brothers, the killer of innocent children only faces destruction.
I ask my friends about the Israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past. They have become so strong today that they don't listen to any one. This is because the Jews are united.
There are no Sheas and Sunnis. There are all just Jews and they have developed everything in every field.
In contrast, what is the condition of 55 Islamic countries?
They are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death.
It is essential that all Muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
There is no better strategy than to recognize Israel, learn modern education and means of progress, and let the world live in peace and harmony.
The Muslims have plenty of land and resources as well.
The need is for proper usage.
The first and most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque.  This was impossible without getting Yasin and Arafat out of the way.
The world is witnessing how Palestine has been scattered  after the death of these two leaders.
and how the Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
In 1974 a Pakistani prime minister was so trusted by the world that for the first time in history he managed to gather all the Muslim leaders under one roof with a hundred percent attendance.
Today on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task for the whole nation to promise to keep unity in its lines.
Will the incomplete mission of forming a joint Islamic nation be advanced while still removing the differences between the Muslims?
This is a Jinn, which has been inside Palestine for half a century.
That Jinn has many mouths.
Often this Jinn calls itself bad names from one of its other mouths to divert the attention and reduce the pressure put on it by other governments.
It is another mouth of this Jinn which is causing the unrest in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This Jinn fears Islam the most, as it knows that only Muslims following the complete religion of Islam practically can remove it. History proves that Islam has brought many Abu Jahls to the path.
The series of bombings of Gaza by Israeli war planes and missile strikes has been going on since the 27th of December.
More than three-hundred Israeli citizens have died so far in these attacks.
Now, after the air strikes, Israeli tanks have reached the Gaza border in preparation for a land offensive.
The Security Council of the United Nations, through a resolution passed in an emergency meeting, have demanded that Israeli and Palestinian authorities stop extremist activities immediately.
However, the Israeli authorities say that they will continue their operation in Gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
In your opinion, is this claim by Israel true?  Is Israel  doing all this to defend its own sovereignty?
Is the world community playing its role in such situation?
Does this aggression have any relation to the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can any improvement be expected in the situation in Middle East after the succession of the newly elected American president Barak Obama?

Palestine will forever remain a sacred place for Muslims and its protection is a must for us.

Israel and India have to vanish one day since these countries are made to be broken. God will surely torment these disbelievers. Sajid Sadiq, Lahore.
"When has a lonely night passed merely by weeping"
When has misfortune departed by praying only?" (Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan)
The BBC makes it a point to dig out and publish such accounts.
After all, they have to maintain the illusion of neutrality.
By the way, BBC news is factual, but an essential factor is the tone in which the news is delivered.
Which news to be made prominent and which news to be considered as insignificant.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
Now even the electronic media and printed media of Pakistan, specifically a few Urdu newspapers and columnists, are not behind anybody else in exhibiting this skill-- who, while giving coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism, and while writing about it, hide facts about the grudge mafia.
It has been said that the United Nations seemingly supports human rights and peace but actually the Muslims are being subjected to extreme levels of cruelty and brutality. And what we hear from the United Nations is that Hamas should stop the attacks. How long will this hypocrisy carry on?
Why there is so much atrocity committed on Muslims. If people like Americans are backing up the Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So, Americans, if you have courage then stop supporting them and see then what their fate is.
These so-called writers and murderers in name of peace should understand that peace in the world can only be obtained through justice and not through genocides.
If any nations can be perished through genocide and results of choice can be obtained then after actions of Hitler, existence of Jews and their uprising was impossible.
As poet says,
Atrocity is atrocity, it vanishes when it rises.
Blood is blood and it clots when it drops.
Now who will tell whom what is terrorism?
Why would this be terroism? Because your own pain is the only one felt?
Are not other people human or is it that the blood of Muslims is so cheap?  Or perhaps, the color of these innocent's was not red?
And now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere?
I saw the terror act of Mumbai attacks as my own house was set on fire. It is painful to see the sufferings of humanity.   If such sufferings cannot be seen by others; May the Muslims think collectively?
Dead bodies on the roads, helpless and wounded people stained with their own blood. How can it be condemned? Words are too poor to express this state.
My heart is crying over the miseries and helplessness of Muslims. On one hand People are being killed in India and on the other hand, without any solid proof, whole world is pressing Pakistan to do more or we will do it ourselves.
On the other side Israel is killing Muslims. The silence of the world is intolerable.
It may be delayed but God will surely do the justice to end the dominance of falsehood.
A threat to Israel's security in the presence of US, no way! It is a joke.
In Israel, such tactics are used by ruling party to achieve public support.Historically no president was powerful enough to change American policies.Barrack Obama is no exception. Forces of Exploitation are similar in their character; whether they are black or white.
In this forum of discussion, it is clear that everybody is mourning the death of Benazir but she is not forgiven for her political mistakes.
It is debatable whether Benazir died for democracy or for the lust of Power.
If Democracy was her motto then why didnt she come before American clearance and deal? Why did she leave democracy under the control of Musharraf's dictatorship for 10 years?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the public needed her, but she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised.
When each and every historic personality is being accused, there is no one to say anything about this.
Sana Khan.
Few things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done about them.

Sir/Sir you should probably not only study Pakistan's history but that of 4 friend and 7 other countries. Maybe you would agree with Psycho's point of view.
Tariq Ayaz.
'Those who don't have a good nature can't be corrected through training.'
Living green in the water made the reflection of the wheat plant look like a cypress.
Britains never let them unite and established the Hindu-Muslim conflict, which was later on brought up by Sir Syed.
psycho
how brutal is our nation that not only we are blind while writing odes on ourselves and our parties but now we are picking, accusing and criticizing every historical scholar and no body is there to say any thing about this.
enough of development that we have made.
Sana Khan
few things are ignored just by thinking that nothing can be done of them. Just like a donkey can not become a scholar by just loading books over it.
Because of the Mumbai attacks, there has been a setback in the dialog between Pakistan and India.  However, Pakistan and India should continue these dialogs.
If we talk of war then it will bring loss of life on both sides.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu but on the other hand when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader, point to be noted.
First of all Merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and to all the Christian brothers of the forum.
greeting to all friends of the Forum: Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, sister Sana, sister Shahida and Mr. Akram.
We desire the flowers of peace rather than the flames of war.
War is itself a problem.
What solution will the war give?
Today it will give fire and blood.
Tomorrow it will give hunger and privation.
For this wise people
It is better that war is postponed.
In your and our garden
It is better that candle keeps lit.
The relationship of India and America have become deep and India knows that when the time comes America will openly deceive Pakistan.
It is the old history of America.
However, America will gain its aims in the Indian attack and the India will bear all the costs.
Pakistan should announce clearly that they will not attack first but when India is the first to strike, there will not be any peace and the war will only come to an end when India is occupied and abolished.
It is the Islamic history.
Before this approval, Pakistani public and force delivered the saying which they wanted.
The Indian efforts of receiving the extraordinary ambassador and force benefits in fulfilling Mambai attacks are making it clever party mare than impress so after the first world hard opposite action decreased on Pakistan by the world.
The showing of the United States and the showing betterment of president of Interpol peace of mind at Pakistani efforts by avoiding unnecessary noise of India is the side effect of the extra ambassador of India.
There are no two sayings about this dishonest action.
The question is where was the Pakistani force and what was it doing when thousands of talibans attacked the village of Pir Same-u-Llah.
Should the content of force not be in action that what they did for their country.
Every day thousands of missiles and bombs has been detonated. How many Taliban citizens has been killed?
I am requesting ISI to, for god's sake, leave the guardianship of Taliban and let us live with peace and happiness in our heaven.
And stop this fake Operation.
For national unity the day is not too far away when in Pakistan the military affirmative will be passed just as it has been passed against Jamiat-Ul-Dawa.
Riyaz Ahmed Farooqui
First our lovers of intemperance and their supporters are continuously collecting the evidence for legal action.  Any day affirmation comes through then there are many possibilities that in this National Unity there will be no one to speak up to voice support for us.
If supposing there is any delay for Affirmative to pass then we can keep an example of America in the forefront so that any one of  power will join us to walk with us.
We dont have the consciousness and knowledge of Sami-Ullah or his personality and his experience with the work he was busy in.
Probably he was not a revolutionary.
Kamri-Dach-Gaveera, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najeeb-zullah and thousands of other revolutionarys dead bodies have been disgraced by the hands of enemies.
They are still in command after death.
But there is an international game being played over here. Here, they are ruling by scaring the public about beastliness and terror.
So that it would be permissible for them, saying that if we are not there, beasts and wild people will come and capture the government.
Such actions in the name of religion of the so-called Islam lovers is extremely disagreeable.
The supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of America, but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions, they give it the name of tribal traditions and clearly avoid it.
No person with a heart can accept these beastly actions, which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of Islam.
I think our army has joint these people.
This is because these people take some time to move around. To catch them will only take so much time. But even if they were there, they escape from there.
Are these people so brave that they take 50 or 70 people hostage and our army watches like an audience with hand on hand?
They are servants of Allah and so is the army.
It is clear that something is sinister.
In Ziya-ul-Haqq's dictatorship, instead of presenting the Noble and Merciful characters of God, an atmosphere of anti-religion was created by the use of many types of narrations of punishments apart from the incident of the body hanging. Even the literature and books like, 'What will happen when we die?' created fear and terror.
And these people are only using this fear as a tool or a weapon to gain worldly pleasures and honor.
preachers!
As you have preached against the fire of Hell
that you have yourself become the face of fear.
It is surprising when it is said that this cannot be the work of a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our own history or we ignore it for some reason.
Upon the death of the Prophet, upon refusing to pledge alliegance, who burned the door of the daughter of the Messenger and pulled her husband out with a rope around his neck?
Had they come from somewhere outside?
Was the strike on Madeena and Great Karbala the work of Hindus and Jews?
Without the submission of the truth nor the movement was away neither the check.
BBC people close quadrant policy.
The title for this incident: "Was it legal or illegal to hit Bush with the shoes?"
Supposedly.
Tahir Chaudhry, Japan
Friend, have some shame!  People have taken a human being from the grave and hung him on a pole just because he raised his voice against wrongfulness, and you are concerned about the title of the box office.
The victory of Operation Sherdil was on the other side of the border. The victorious invasion of the Operation Lion Heart was dependent on the favor of opinion of the normal citizens.
These steps were taken by the American and Pakistani agencies. Peer Sahib was the target of this conspiracy.
All the criticism is now going to be directed against the Taaliban because undercover people have infiltrated the Taaliban very successfully and they are taking steps to encourage normal people to change their opinions.
I have only the question of the day that what will the force be doing when the dead body was hanging the whole day,are they sitting in country to kill the normal people those say like this two children and thier mother dead by bombing on Taliban houses.
Were they not know about that chowk?
Or they were seeing an action film?
We say it with excuse, stop this game for Allah's sake.
At last, there is a commander upon you as well.
A question raised from BBS if it is not reasonable but alas on the sow thinking of writers,.for example it was asked from any person that for what purpose the force went Swaaat containing 30000 persons.
The dead bodies of the helpers of force fighting with the Taliban remained hanging on poles all day.
What did the Pakistani Force do to help the people of Swat? How did the media or the BBC or the world knowing about this do anything to help? It was not good.
The Pakistani force is making drama.
Every child of Swaat is saying that this is a blood drama.
Please stop this drama, for God's sake.
The Taliban has destroyed the name of Muslims.
If the Muslims take over the whole world they won't have any place to leave the terror from.
Those that are not interested in working and not interested in living peaceful life take guns and join those people.
Islam has not came under the pressure of gun or sword.
Shame on you.
There is no reason for this in any religion or in any family.
BBC, along with other media, has gathered information about the Taliban.
But the reality is not even known to anyone. That is the real situation. We only know because we are tribal.
Bssically, it is a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD, and our ISI, are involved. There is no one in from the Taliban or from tribal. Terror was created from the above agencies, who are insulting the Taliban, Islam, Madarsa's, Pestos, and Tribals
Because of this action Muslims had their heads down with shyness.
I salute the MQM Leader, Altaf Hussain, and the ANP and PPP leaders who are against this cancer. It means speaking out against the Taliban.
This cancer created by Ziaulhaq, he left the government but, also desires to destroy Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that the present leadership will end this cancer.
In India, after the Mumbai attacks, it was said that behind this attack were Pakistani extremists.
Pakistan denies the blames and said it will give all possible assistance to India in interrogation.
India said that it gave a list to Pakistan which shows suspected names of extremist which India required.
Pakistan said that the listed names included Jaish Muhammad Leader Mulana Masood Azhar, who hid in exile and the government did not have any information on him.
Before that, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari denied that Western secret agencies and the Indian government gave evidence to Pakistan about the Mumbai attack.
president Zardari said about Ajmal Qasaab that this was not prove that he is Pakistani.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned Pakistan that its relationship with India cannot improve if it's land is being used for terrorism.
In the latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to Pakistan.
Should these political events affect sports?
What do you see as the future of Pakistan and India relations?
Neither America will break Pakistan nor India.
Pakistan will be broken by Pakistanis themselves.
What do you expect after so much provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism.
It has been proven over time that Jinnah has not been good to the Muslims of India.
Yasmin, Chicago.
Madam, If  Mr. Jinnah's vision had been realized, neither the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism would have  spread in Pakistan nor would the Muslims in India have displayed such behavior.
It's our fault that we could not bring up a leader of his stature.
If we can not care for our heroes, then
This region has great capabilities.
God knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
In both countries, the destroyers of peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv Sena, RSS have been raised.
And the evil powers don't want this region to progress, therefore, these countries are controlled like puppets.
Can you imagine what status this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world?
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
May Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
Sir, if you open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
Other than the national matter are not looking good as well, circumstances in Sarhad, Balochistan, Karachi in Sindh are in front of you.
In this situation, the country needs a leader who can unite us as a single Nation.
O Allah, have mercy on us.
In my opinion, there is no way other than a last war.
Enough much has happened
Now, this affair is win or lose.
This problem will not be solved with hypocritical deceit.
And neither with small big terrorism in each other countries.
Even Europe, too, came to rest after fighting the last great war.
If this war had not happened, then they would all be talking like Pakistan and India.
Almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be stopped.
Our military leadership doesn't seem to be sincere in these regards. On the one hand, America and Europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism, and on the other hand we secretly help the Taliban.
We should think and fix our direction and choose only one side.
There is no doubt that the majority of the workers of Jama'athud Da'wah are the previous members of Lashkar-e-Taiba who joined the group called Jama'athud Da'wah Pakistan after Lashkar-e-Taiba was rendered inexistent.
However, after that, the members gave preference to social work.  Even now Jama'athud Da'wah was rendered inexistent by the United Nations due to the pressure applied by India and the crackdown being enforced by the Pakistani government.
I believe that if Jihadi groups leave religious fundamentalism and take up social efforts that would be better.
The present terrorist groups that bring up criminals in the name of Jihad, and the elders of these Mullas, are the same people who used to call Pakistan 'Palidistan', and other derogatory terms.
Now they are not leaving any stone unturned in the quest to destroy Pakistan.
Actually, these are not even fit to be called human beings, let alone 'Muslims'.
Without cleaning Pakistan of these mischief mongers, the national security will remain at risk.
Can we still think about whether or not to put a ban on these mischief mongers?
There is no place on earth for extremist Mullah's who only work to cause killings.
This news tore my heart.
What kind of world is that in which it has become difficult for those who even take the name of one of the important parts of the religion of Allah, Islam ?
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims, but if a Muslim even tries to extract revenge, along with the whole non-Muslim world, even the hypocrite leaders join and treat those who have sincere religious feeling like our great leaders are treating Hafiz Saeed.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-Pak relationships turned sour, for the first time suffering a severe setback.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-Pak relationships turned sour, for the first time suffering a severe setback.
India has always claimed that militant and non-militant groups which are active in Pakistan are responsible.
For the relationships to return to normal, taking action against these countries is being made a prerequisite.
Whereas Indian security agencies have accused Lashkar-e-Taiba of being directly responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
The name  Jama'athud Da'wah also comes up many times in this regards.
This is not the first time that relationships between the two countries have become serious due to some terrorist activity that took place in India.
In December 2001, after the attack on the parliament, the two neighbors were prepared to go to war.
After that, Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned and it was included in the list of terrorist groups.
Now, it is being demanded that Jama'athud Da'wah, which according to security reports is just a new form of Lashkar-e-Taiba, also be banned.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against the active fundamentalist groups within its boundaries or not?
Can putting a ban on Jama'athud Da'wah help the present Indo-
Pak crisis to subside, and how important is it for permanent peace between the two countries that armed groups be dismantled?
The Security Council of the United Nations has passed the ban on Jama'athud Da'wah. However, what proof did the Security Council have on which to base such urgency?
Does the Security Council always show urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complaint and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful state.
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were brought to their knees by a few terrorists for three days. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have advanced in every field.
But when Mullahism rose in popularity in the religion, the people were divided into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salam: Please do it with pleasure but act on your own.
Do not do it under American pressure.
If India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give evidence?
And why does it accuse us of everything?
There are extremist groups and organizations in India as well. Why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the world?
What is India doing in Kashmir?
What is Israel doing?
The truth is that we are the first nuclear Muslim state, and this is the main issue.
Pakistan is now in last steps.
Kamran Hasan, Abu Dhabe
Your speech is from the heart  like the situation calls for.
Now the printed new map of Pakistan is shown in American newspapers and the round of punctuation is also a sign of it.
America is gripping more on Pakistan slowly day by day.
In this situation if we did not show union as a nation then there is possible another part as Bangla daish.
To show disatbleness of errorism is less where will be it in Mambae Hotal, Meriat hotal in Islamabad and in Falastin.
These terorrists should be punished whether they are from Pakistan, India, America or Israel.
Now the question is, "Why is the world silent," since a lot of people died by the terrorist attacks in Pakistan.
Was the attack on the Mariat hotel a terrorist attack?
Then why?
Hats off to Home Adviser, Mr. Rahman Malik! Masha Allah, he has become so brave and courageous!
?
Not only that, according to BBC, the above mentioned Mr. Malik has vehemently disproved this belief that the arrest of terrorists was being done at the 'request of others'.
Brother, Subhanallah!
Whether the ability is there or not, or whether it should be said that it is not needed.
We, i.e. Pakistan, are fighting somebody else's war.
And what about our own interest which we are trying so hard to save?
No one has the right to interfere in any country's affairs.
This does not seem to be the era of new populations.
If people expect justice or demand that an external united court be established to respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or military regime, there could be peace in the Third World, including Pakistan.
For example, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
In fact, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population, this problem still occurs.
And this causes more feelings of opposition.
If they trust America and the United republics, then let them leave the style of new populations, and let them work on those lines, upholding the sovereignty of the state.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
In Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, security forces captured a camp of practically non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India's accusation is that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice told the Pakistani leadership that there should be immediate action taken against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack.
He said that the extremists whom attacked Mambae used Pakistani earth.
Meanwhile, Pashawar commanders say that unknown soldiers fired and destroyed 50 miltary trucks.
It is the second attack on NETO and America.
Meanwhile, Pakistan made the show of distinctive party Lashkar-e-Taiba and before this was tried to make military persons nonmilitary and military weapons were changed with money and certainly no any action without it.
The situations told that in the past period of President ZiaulHaq  the efforts of Pakistan to end of miltary parties in the result of enterance of Soviat Union in Afghanistan and the resistance by America funding did not succeed.
The question is, is this what Pakistan really wants to do?
Are Pakistan really capable of this?
What do you say?

I ask only one question from the flag holders of humanity.
If you kill their children and they bring necklace for you, this is impossible.
Saeed, Multan.
And question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies, say any logic, argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men, laborers and poor workers of different occupations, in revenge of American attack?
If the answer is no, then you have instant need of correcting your point of view.
People were armed, at that time it was dangerous that Russia will turn toward Pakistan after Afghanistan, therefore people were armed.
Now when there is danger that America will overrun Pakistan through passage of Afghanistan of which American president had said out in his election campaign then why should we unarm these people?
Only because America or India army don't have to face any civil resistance after defeating Pakistani army?
Yes, if anyone of them is involved in any destructive actions then Pakistan should act against them.
But this is more, that government against Lashkar-e-Taiba proves correct by India that Pakistan is involve in that.
Najeeb Ul Rehman Saico, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
If we accept that Laskaray Taiba is involved, it is still wrong to blame the Pakistani government.
And one question is also that this terrorist have a either get support of any Government or Indian government personal?
Are terrorist's only born and made in Pakistan and not made in India and rest of the world?
As far as Lashkar-e-Taiba is concerned they are not involved in this recent terror.
this has remember that Hafiz Saeed was the first person who called Taliban acts as 'Fitnah'.
this is my firm believe that Taliban acts was a part of American projects so that every that person and group need to clean out from the way who challenge Taliban in any manner.
even support by whole nation, take action against Lashkar due to Indian pressure indicate Zardindco frustration and butter up nature.
Americans said to end this campagin which started from Saudi's funding. Ask them now to clean this dirt as well, which make our society polluted.
One should also protest against them that according to ethics, America and Saudi Arabia distributed dangerous weapons and named Jihadis, but in reality spread the virus of hateful literature and culture due to which slaughter houses were opened in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, the announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan, and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly and tried its best to convince India that she should attack Pakistan.
This shattered the confidence of America in the area.
Although India did not even threaten nor does it have the guts to.
And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of the Taliban on American posts.
Thus it was proven that without the support of Pakistan and its army, America can do nothing.
Karachi is Pakistan's business and economic center, and Dubai of the less privileged areas.
Hundreds of thousands do not return empty-handed from here. But since the law was enforced on the western borders, Karachi has taken all the attention.
Now they are looking to kidnap this city.
For the first time Pathan's are called Pashtoons. They are made to fight by making them strangers to each other, although the need is to be united.
One possible solution to the problem is this that either Urdu speaking learn Peshto or Peshto speaking learn Urdu, or what's better is they all learn English.
You will surely think this as a ridiculous suggestion but do you think that the reason for this conflict is not ridiculous?
The reason of violence is language?
Zaheer Chughtai.
Sir I gave this suggestion through childhood to my friends in which there were people according to classification from every religion and dialect but friends used to laugh on me talks.
At that time the condition of Jinna of hatred of dialectal and religious was not that alive and strong but it was brewing internally.
I don't understand what is happening or why.
Aren't these the signs signalling the End of Days?
For what crime are innocent and guiltless being killed?
The reasons are in front of everyone who wants to divide Pakistan in pieces some are active here. The ones who do this neither have religion nor country.
Whether it is Karachi or Bombay, we have destroyed our own homes.
When the government comes, they just change names of the places to build a name for themselves. These days, airports, roads, and buildings are all named Benazir.
What has happened in Karachi, is this what Benazir means?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of the RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
The unjustified killing of Pashto-speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awakened sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
While the patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties has taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time it has also given American planners one more chance to think.
The MQM and the ANP are responsible for the turmoil in Karachi, and the government is only interested in itself.
Management can control the situation in 1 hour but it is being given wind on purpose.
Pressure of political parties on police and rangers keep them from doing the operation.
Talks of getting united are only limited to statements; political parties should let go of their self-interests and work for the interest of the common man.
As long as there is political pressure on the government, more incidents will take place. May Allah save Pakistan.
I believe these people are the biggest terrorists.
And there are definitely some foreign forces at work here, but I do not know whose.
And the sad thing is that if such a situation was prevalent in any border town, the government would take care of that place. But since this is far from the border, the government looks helpless.
The government should set up an operation here, and save a big and important town from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth due to fear, and as for the local media, it is even thinner.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that either the Urdu-speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun-speaking people learn Urdu; even better, both could learn English.
You might think this is a funny proposal, but isn't the reason for the clashes funny?
that the cause of extremism be language?
They spilled blood in Karachi, and the story that each citizen was fearing for a long time was finally written.
No one left any stone unturned.  The reports that surfaced in the media only told 50% of what actually happened here in four days.
I stayed up the last three nights and I am still afraid.
The people who killed the cobblers and peanut sellers are those who evacuated the hotel.
The people who looted the super highway and cut the ears off of innocent people are all unaware of Allah's punishment, which can catch them anytime.
What do you think are the reasons for this sudden violence?
(BBC)
Keeping the heart rendering Mumbai attacks in view and diving to search for a cause for the violence in Karachi is not at all needed.  Rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in 'blood'.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control.
Liaquat Ali Khan and many other freedom fighters belong to that. He was writing a poem to remove Mr. Saiko's misunderstanding.
We will reestablish the old traditions.
We Live for it; and will sacrifice whatever it Takes to protect it.
Faizan Tausif Siddiqui
It's very sad that the whole country is at stake and we are still fighting each other
Mr. Siddiqui, in Wikipedia
We got to know that Liaquat Ali Khan was related to the province of Punjab, in the area of Karnal and belongs to a Punjabi family.
for his efforts towards the Refugees, He  is considered as one of their own.
Every action has it's reaction.
You can tolerate till your own bust.
Ijaz Awan
Sir, before you convince a large number of people with your proposals, I shall tell you that the signs of this mischief are also found on the walls of Karachi, in the form of posters and wall chalking.
We have been seeing both types of mischief.
Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan alone. They did not have to face any reaction.
Quite the opposite, they are pecking at the heart of Pakistan.
There used to be one Muslim League.  They made the rough version of the 18th amendment and handed it over to the People's Party.
Before that, MQM and Muslim League (q) had already handed in rough versions of the 18th amendment to the national assembly and senate.
It still seems that the copy of the 18th amendment is a political trickery, and no one is sincere about accepting that amendment.
This is why no fuss was made in the assembly or on the floor of senate over this amendment and the parliament was not forced into accepting the amendment.
It looks as if the parties just wanted to get the thing off their backs by submitting the rough versions, so that tomorrow they may say that they submitted their versions of the amendment but the government speaker did not take action.
MQM coalition partner of government, Muslim League N an underhand ally of government and Muslim league Q the party to approve the seventeenth amendment then how is it possible that these parties can be sincere to approve the disapprove amendment.
It's just like writing your name amongst shaheeds by just putting color on yourself.
The People's Party is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment anyways.
How would one think of getting his own hands cut?
As long as Zardari is the president, the seventeenth amendment is not going to be repealed.
This is the opinion of a majority in our survey and so is the truth.
If the seventeenth amendment had been canceled then Zardari would never had become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Musharaf because along with being the president he is also the chairman of the People's party.
As long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.
In order to cancel the seventeenth amendment, the political parties will first have to dismiss President Zardari from the presidency.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
Most of the elders from our family belonged to the labor community.
In our childhood, when we used to see our uncles doing labor work, we used to pray to Allah to save us from this hard work.
To avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what we should do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor.
The editor replied that we should select certain fields including medicine and engineering.
Right from beginning, my concentration was in engineering, selecting technical drawing instead of Biology.
But at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.
I studied biology for hardly a month and then when nothing worked out, I took math as an alternate subject.
Fear of labor made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.
I remembered that when I along with my two sons were trying to remove the carpets from our old house.
It was only half an hour since he started working that the little boy said, "Daddy, I am not born to do this".
I said that if this is true then study a lot like us and get rid of the physical labor.
The son said, "I am studying and I will get through it, but it is the work that I cannot do".
In three hours, we had completed the job and returned home.
The point of this story is that if a person picks his destiny, whatever is the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving that destiny.
Here if you do not know what you have to do then may God help you!
It is said that you should not say bad things about the dead, but what shall we do? We see only bad things in Benazir, even on the anniversary of her first death.
Benazir, for her selfish purpose, crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs after giving the list of the names of those who were fighting for freedom. On the other hand, she gave India the chance to keep its full attention on Kashmir after helping to suppress the Punjab movement.
A tug-of-war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history and has pushed the country back many years.
Even after her exile, Benazir continued to make negative comments about Kashmir and the nuclear program.
Baenazir violated the pact with Nawaz Shareef in London by making a deal with General Musharaf
Because of Baenazir's open hand policy towards family members in earning money during her rule, he became known as Mr. Ten Percent.
In the time of Baenazir, her brother was murdered, and his killers are still at large.
Besides being a woman, Baebnazir did not fight for the rights of women.
The way in which Baenazir did politics on her fathers dead body, in the same way her followers are doing politics on the dead bodies of her family.
Baenazir got to be a leader twice and in that time, she punished her father's murder and for some, she didn't even file charges against them.
It has been 37 years since the separation of eastern Pakistan, and, sadly, no leader condemns this day nor do they call it a black day.
We should have mourned this 16th of September as a black day and taken steps to prevent similar tragic incidences from occurring in the future.
On this day we should have sent the Bangali's letters of consolation and tried to bring them closer to us.
Now we look at the reasons why Eastern Pakistan was separated.
He planned to bring back the people of Bihar who were stuck in Bangladesh, and he sent them gifts to keep their spirits up.
We have become so insensitive that if someone dies in our neighborhood, we're not even aware of it.
We don't care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
A huge calamity can pass by, but the next day we are lost in our day-to-day routine of life.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again, like East and West Germany.
We can become one again if we sacrifice a little for each other and leave our selfishness behind us.
Unfortunately, this wish is unlikely to be fulfilled in the near future.
When it was announced today that the Governor of Illinois was caught on corruption charges
and that he would soon be up for removal by the state congress, an American friend of mine told us, "Look, this is called democracy."
In America, no gigantic figure is above the law.
and there is your country, Pakistan, whose president has been elected after his corruption charges were dropped.
My sense of humor spoke, and I said "What's wrong if a governor got arrested in America - in Pakistan, we arrested the Prime Minister overnight and hanged him once, and another time we exiled one."
tell me when it happened in America?
Pakistan awarded the person who broke the law with a guard of honor from the presidency. When did this happen in America?
In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was suspended, and, besides public support, he has yet to be restored. Has that ever happened in America?
A holder of a falsified degree was made the Minster of Health in Pakistan, did this ever happen in America?
After hearing all of this, the American fell down laughing and conceded defeat.
In this picture President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded by Americans on all sides.
it looks from his smile
He thinks that America supports his government, but he is forgets that a year ago, they were with Pervez Musharaf.
The picture looks like that of a family.
Before this no picture, as such, has been published in which the President is with 3 American authorities.
It looks like America's work has been increased in Pakistan and one or more Authorities are working on it or they might not believe that person as compared to the first one.
It might be possible that they have planned this also, keeping in mind the nature of President Zardari's promise fulfillment.
Had he been an intelligent politician then he  would be at least not been smiling in this picture and his face would show some signs of embarrassment.
If the Principle of Democracy is applied to this picture then President Zardari is in the minority.
According to Democracy, the majority makes the rules for the nation and that is who is shown in the picture.
The  Swat ares of Pakistan is like heaven on earth and is also known as Switzerland.
Till now, according to the Government Policy, cross talks are  going along together with the use of power.
But the use of force is resulting in increased support and sympathy for the Taliban among people not receiving any benefit from it.
The government must, instead of using the power, eliminate the causes of the issue.
By eliminating these causes Fazlullah and the Taliban will automatically fade.
The Sharia bill proposed by ANP will solve the problems in Swat to a great extent.
But besides implementation of the Sharia, the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues.
At the beginning of General Musharaf rise, it looked like the nation had rid itself of the incompetent politicians, but the lust for power changed all his plans.
all the hopes were from the participation in the "War of terror", he had started considering himself immortal.
The next logical and expected steps never happened.
As soon as Bush's era was near its end he started worrying about the end of his rule. In his panic, he made a deal with thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army, but he never had a handle on what was happening in the government.
In Bajor or Swat the army does not control terror but bombs the "Enemy" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy out to be mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy?
Despite the military operation in Swat, a war-torn area of NWFP, things are getting worse.
On one hand the writ of GOVT is limited to a resolution of condemnation passed by National assembly while on other hand the influence of Taliban's FM channel is increasing in swat.
The common citizen has no choice but to obey the rule of power.
Security forces in swat have used lethal weapons and claim to have killed many extremists. Despite these causalities, the Taliban's power is rising and they control nearly 80% of Swat.
As a result, GOVT is not accepting its failure and the Taliban is getting stronger.
The poor citizen is the only loser.
Someone in Swat asked, "How are the Talibans?"  The answer is, "They are very good; they are fighting the war against the enemies of God."
A question about the army was answered, "Very good, it is fighting against the enemies of our country."
Who are the enemies of religion and country? ""The poor citizens"", it was answered.
I am greatly astonished, how the Army of Pakistan will fight against Indian Army when it has failed to control a small group of Talibans.
They are unable to track the illegal FM radio channel of Taliban. I think that can easily be tracked.
This FM radio is strongly propagating the agenda of hatred and terror.
After the girls' school, now they are demolishing the schools for boys.
Curfew is imposed to facilitate the Taliban's movement.
Tonight, during curfew, they have made new bunkers in the nearby areas of Mangora.
Question arises, how did they reach there during curfew?
If Army can kill Akbar bugti in a cave, why taliban can't be targeted?
For God's sake, the Army should take actions to free the helpless people of Swat from the brutal occupation of Taliban. This will improve the image of the Pakistan Army.
He has said that religion is the reason of bloodshed; would you kindly tell me if it would be a peaceful world without any concept of religion?
Does religion divide us on an ethnic, linguistic and regional basis?
No Sir, religion is what teaches that no one is black or white, punjabi or muhajir otherwise if religion was not present, then half world would have vanished in the war between white and black and other half fighting over the status and sect.
Actually, religion gives moral teachings to the man. And binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here. And he should spend his life according to his rules.
As a Muslim, I have total faith that Islam is a complete way of life and a true religion.
After living in London, for many years I used to ask wellness of my family over the phone every morning. Although most of them did not even call once to find out how we were. Then I realized that they do not even like our phone calls so we stopped calling.
Living here in France for the last two years, I have also felt the same idea.
I do not know why people expect us to call.
A resolution passed about Iraq in a few hours, Darfar has absolutely no problem in sending peace army.
The Bombay attacks were condemned in no time and banning dubious groups is only a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are consenting.
O caretakers of international peace, life is finishing here!
Are people really waiting for it to finish?
So that some oppressed person would not even be able to think about using some mass destruction weapon like ill will to obtain their right?
Even when a father is holding the corpse of his son, an ounce of sorrow does not arise from any part of your heart?
If not, you have no right to be called a human.
rather, you are a blemish on the name of humanity.
OK, it was proven that this area was also the home of the Israelis for thousands of years.
Ideally, these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection, but since their strings are in the hands of the western and Arab countries, peace is not possible without their will.
Rather, now even Iran wants to fight a proxy war from here.
Even if Israeli action has stopped for a while, it will start again after some incident.
The owner of the BBC is interested in serving America and Israel, and this is why in the name of 'enlightenment' it has come out with a series of Zionist favoring blogs, and is seeding biased and blind propaganda.
What BBC is doing is  just a formality. Primary objective is to earn sympathies.
My request to the moderator is that the commentary of applicants should be published to show that BBC still has some respect for facts.
Thanks.
I don't know how this story was imitated, but one is sure that Dracula of every age is thirsty of human blood.
There were wars and bloodshed in every era of history.
It is strange that people of the 21st century, who claim to be more civilized, do not show any concern over open bloodshed.
How does he not feel that what is happening around is a distorted/worst face of humanity.
The most tragic aspect: how the current face of civilized man will present the concept of humanity to next generations.
Well wisher, Sajjad ul Hasan, Hayderabad dakan.
At the moment in Dera Ghazi khan and in other parts of the country, it is raining.
here is a poem about the weather. Enjoy the weather along with this poem.
The rains are present.
If it rains, it is spring.
If it stays, then it is peace.
Sometimes it comes without a reason.
At times spread over day and night
Sometimes, it is very noisy, and sometimes it is very quiet.
The rains are present.
In a memory, at a night
to a buried ash
Sometimes the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burned itself.
Sometimes each drop seems sorrowful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What it means to them is whether the country lasts or not.
Whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them.
Our media is corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday afternoon something surprising happened.
All the police are running around, but they do not check illegal parking.
Even the traffic cops were not interested in ticketing the illegally parked vehicles.
What happened is that a plane of the U.S. Air Force actually became a ship and landed in the Hudson River.
Till today only this much is known, that the ""terrorist"" belonged to the family of birds called goose.
It was historical cold spell yesterday in New York.
The temperature never goes down this much.
After walking outside for half an hour, I felt pain in my jaw.
Imagine the horrendous condition of those people who jumped from the plane into the icy river.
The reason for their happiness is that all of them were safe.
The reason for concern is that the company plane sank during the financial crisis.
Seeing all those sites, I reached the New Jersey side from the  West Side Highway. There I found the South Bond closed. What should I do?
Coming back I got stuck in the busy street.
Thank the Lord! After an hour of hassle, a route was open for me. I found myself at the exit of street 56.
I had not come across the exit first, nor the long lines.
Mekki: My Pakistan! Good greetings. Eid Mubarak to you.
Umar: Of course, Faithful!
Shugfath: Good greetings! Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I had two chickens. It's a sacrifice. Janzeb will tell you how it was.
There was no other option. Otherwise, I would have to go to the farm
to prepare the meat and skin the chicken, too.

What happened on the forum?

The snow will vanish.
We unnecessarily kept thinking of these Taliban of Swat as indelicate, but who were only unhappy over women's education.
They kept expressing their grief by demolishing a womens schools and college somewhere every day.
But just like other ideas, this idea also did not come true, according to this report by CNN. Today on the sacred day of Monday this Taliban gang of Swat have blasted a boy's school.
In Swat,the Taliban closed down the school.
The girls' schools were pulled down first in the cause of famous English school Ladies First and I do not understand why people consider Taliban free of crimes.
It is also known that it is wrong that the Taliban are only against the education of girls.
Rather, they are totally against education.
These freedom fighters are gifted with more power and the Devil
which is commanding us and he is helped to abolish it.
Amen, Amen.
Wonderful, 120 school have been closed so far.
The Muslim tradition of engagement before birth, to marriage with Quran in order to control inheritance and the insistence of many mufties that the girl became adult and sensible at 8 years old. In India, a girl was married to a frog.
See the pictures taken at the time of marriage.
Sometime before this, there was a girl married to a dog.
Let's see that groom.
Humanity has ceased to exist in the 21st century.
This is the time of the computers, and their role in our lives is ever increasing.
A lot of people have reservations on so much dependence on computers in our lives, especially in case of financial or monetary matters.
Where there are certain comforts by the use of credit cards, this allows law enforcement agencies to get to know more about you.
Now, with just a look at the credit card transaction record, your whereabouts can be traced.
In the future, the use of real paper money will get limited because the benefits of credit cards will increase more.
In crime it is preferred to steal credit card information rather than looting a bank.
Similarly, the computer has provided a means for friendship or networking.
Social Networking sites like Orkut, Facebook and MySspace comes are first tier compared according to popularity.
But don't you feel that psychologically, the more we accustome ourselves to social networks, the more we are physically getting away from people.
Like Match making websites that match your choices to other peoples choices to find similarities and you get a list of such matches.
Now can you spend your life with a person exactly like you ?
I can't and that's why we can't compromise a life partner who is half or partly similar to you.
My faults can be compensated by my partners'.
I guess I got a lesser part of intelligence.
Since childhood, whenever an elder said anything to me that was the truth for me.
This is how I came to the believe that Dad has the answer to every question in the world.
People used to make a lot of jokes about me because of this.
the only thing that look truth is which can be done in real.
It's frustrating,that they feel it is necessary to lie.
Because of this, he suffered as well.
It is always my desire to lie as little as possible.
Don't tell lies, especially in the name of God.
Say "inshallah" only when the prayer is for God to accomplish it.
God knows your true intentions.
This is the only complication due to the distance from the religion.
According to our religion and the law of Pakistan, a minor should stay with their mother.
Their expenses are the responsibility the father when the father can meet them.
Then when the kids mature, they can live with anyone they want.
You have rightly said about the misunderstandings relatives create.
We act like this because of feudal thinking.
Even today we think the child will simply follow in their parent's footsteps, but the opposite is true. Although there's advantages to following in the father's footsteps.
With reference to relationships, this forceful affiliation has created evil in our society.
The concept of marriage of a divorcee or a widow is ending.
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason for family breakups.
In our society, if the wife of a 50-55 year old man or the husband dies and he remarries, why is he looked down upon?
My own Pakistani uncle lost his wife 10 or 12 years ago.  Now that his children are grown and married, he married another widow.  And because of this, his own children have turned against him!
In my point of view, it is their religious right. What do you say?
They said: "How could he consider having someone else take the place of our mother?"
According to my thinking, his sons should think about what he did wrong when he married a widow after the marriage of their children?
In this way, the widow got someone to help and support her and he got someone to take care of his home.
His sons and daughters engaged in each of their lives and would not care for him.
The reason is lack of knowledge.
If their wives deny to serve him tomorrow, then what will he do?
It is the result of the stress of society.
People mock such a family and such an action, so the sons oppose the second marriage.
In actual fact, what their father did is in accordance with Islamic principles.
It is a curse in our society that we are caught in from 40 to 50 years.
A wife feels that her husband can do lots of bad things but does not have to remarry.
If she has the potency, she will try, even after her death.
Along with her husband, she is also losing the life after death, and she is one for the evils things in the environment
Saying the word "Islam" does nothing; its rituals are significant.
like, demotivation for the girls education, and love marriage, etc.,
Now your question is, if the big brother went to the widow's home instead of bringing the widow to his home, would this avoid quarrels from his children?
We embraced Islam even before the separation of Hindustan and Pakistan, but we have not came out of such evil thinking and this ritual is more important than Islam
The second marriage of a man is bad, divorce is known to be bad. The divorced woman is untouchablesion, the marriage of a man with a elder woman is said to be the evil plan of the woman. the above things are of such evil thinkings
and we think that if we wont follow modernism, we are considered to be an old thinking man
Embracing Islam is easy but to abandon evil thinking is almost impossible.
Allah, bless us with the ability and courage to do this task.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never that difficult.
It took centuries to write this little.
Think of this less as a lot.
Goodbye.
Ameer Taimur writes in his book, "I am Taimur,"  "I found the secret in my time alive that if the commander of any army is present on the front lines, then that army will never be defeated."
But here the things are altogether different.
They say the population is getting killed for us by default.
If anyone dies from the population, it is considered murder.
May peace and blessing of Almighty be upon you.
I was coming back to my shop after the Isha prayer tonight, a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called me.
I thought that probably this man has lost his way or wants to ask something, I stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked me if I could speak and understand Arabic, I said no problem, you tell me what's up?
He started telling that he has come from Riyadh and here in Medina someone picked his pocket, so he needed help. I said please go away brother, since such an incident has already taken place with me that I gave this man 12 riyals so that he could reach Riyadh, but he started doing the same act after moving a little further.
Angrily, I cursed at him and threatened to call the police, so he ran away.
This is the situation of Muslims now that even for begging we ride our cars along with our families and make at least 2 to 3 thousand a day.
However there is a clear Hadith (SAAW) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one.
May Allah bless us and make us true Muslims (Amen)
Wassalam

The wife of famous singer Adnan Sami approached a Police Station in Mumbai; accusing him of torture.
The Police Station advised her to approach the court.
Saba Galadari the wife of Adnan Sami gave an application against her husband that Adnan Sami continuously tortures her.
He is also administering in human behavior against her.
Now this thing has gone out of her tolerance, therefore, a case may be registered against Adnan Sami.
Police  station has advised her to approach the courts as the case is not within the valid jurisdiction of police station
Do you think that the accusation on Adnan Sami by his wife is correct?
Could this accusation be an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Inform us about your opinion on the Subject.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
As far as allegations are concerned, anyone can accuse someone else.
Nothing comes before prestige.
however may be the relations between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he left his respectful life and went to India to make money and now this fame has caught him badly.
This is a consequence of his own deeds.
Washington...
Top American officials say that president Obama will take a strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
In the new American policy over Afghanistan, there is more emphasis on war than development.
Officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achievement of American goals.  In his government there is corruption, drug business has increased, and Taliban are regaining their power.
American officials say that the people who are putting more pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more include Vice President Joe Biden and President Obama's representative for Afhanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke.
He said that the strategy came forward after President Bush left. He participated in video conferences with Hamid Karzay every two weeks. Those conferences emphasized America's role in reconstructing Afghanistan and it's cities.
The American officer said that the Central administration under Obama will actually work with local leaders for a change.
Officials say that they will stress the fight against corruption, joining hands with the Karzay administration.
Hamid Karzay is going to face a new election and it is still not clear whether Obama and his friends will support Karzay's candidacy for President.
Can we predict whether the declaration by the American Officer will affect a policy change in Afghan affairs?
Or whether Hamid Karzay's rule is coming to an end?
What do you think about it?
Sri Lanka beat Pakistan in the three one-day international cricket match series 2-1.
In the first one-day match, Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka. However, Sri Lanka won the remaining two matches.
In the third day match the performance of the national team was too awesome. The team chasing a target of 309 runs of SriLanka was able score only 75 in 23 overs.The national team should thus have learned a lesson from this defeat.
From the results of the series, it becomes evident that the performance of the national cricket team is not consistent.
Despite home ground and all claims, the national team suffered defeat. What do you think are the reasons?
Which aspects of the game should experts focus on?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
Which part do you place the responsibility of the loss on, fielding, batting or bowling?
Let us know your opinion.
Malik Babar Husain, Jeddah. It is very sad that even in todays modern age, such ignorant traditions are prevalent. If the landlord or the property owner targets innocent people with his harsh dictatorship, who will call them Muslims?
Let any big shot walk on these burning coals. Why does the government allow them to do that?
When will we find justice through the courts?
The Sri Lankan cricket team arrived in Pakistan to play the one day international series.
The foreign team is still coming to Pakistan despite tensions with India.
On arrival at Karachi airport, the SriLankan team was given a warm welcome.
Two matches between Pakistan and Srilanka will be at Karachi and Lahore.
Both teams are claiming assurance regarding bowling, batting, and fielding.
Srilankan is proud of their Spiner while Pakistani is believing in their fast bowler.
Srilankan Captain, Mahela Jaywardena, has said that not one player on the Pakistan team, but rather the whole Pakistan team is dangerous.
Murlidharan and Mendas will be our trump card; on the other side Pakistan' Captain has said that the competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik has said that we have played Murlidharn and will see Mendas as well.  They have developed a secret game plan which they will show at the ground.
Will Pak-Sri series be entertaining and thrill?
Whose side is heavier in the Pakistan and Srilanka series?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Tell us your opinion.
Gulfam, London, Publish statements that are of liking, you give preference to We would like you to write the truth.  Do not entangle the statement like Mukher Jee, because it is commanded to say truth in front of tyrant and it is equal to Crusade(Jihad).

It is all these people's doing Kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years.
No, no one  asked, now that they are caught in a war of extremism and terrorism so they have started talking about peace and settlement.
First they generally massacred Muslims, now they are perplexedly settling the matters.
In a way, Pakistan has to understand their own duplicitous policies.
Asad Khan, London
India creates situations that make people all over the world focus their attention on Kashmir.
Pakistan always shows the truth of India to the world.
The British government also understands that India created a bad image of Pakistan's terrorism so that people would focus on Kashmir occupation.
and are frustrated to talk this matter over with Pakistan.
British Foreign minister David Milliband said that by resolving Kashmir issue terrorism will be reduced and the government of Pakistan can handle new challenges impressively on its border.
The President of the United States Barack Obama expressed a similar opinion.
British foreign minster has said that even though the fight against terrorism is dangerous, for their own safety they chose to fight.
David Milliband said that Pakistan did not show sympathy for terrorist groups.
Due to pressure from big powers to resolve conflict of Kashmir, India tries to direct focus to this region to turn back concentration from the problem.
Perhaps Mumbai terrorism is a part of this conspiracy?
Does India want to use terrorism as a means to avoid dialogue?
Let us know about your opinion.
Usman Aftab
I think the big powers (countries) are who want to harm Pakistan.
They in fact are thinking of ways to control Pakistan because they know Pakistan is an atomic power.
They want to create an environment for revolution.
Foreign countries are thinking that if Pakistan is cornered that will pose more political and geographical problems. They want to help Pakistan so they can achieve their vested interests.
A citizen of USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition; walking stick in arm and name of Ram on lips.
I think from sometimes, there is an anxiety and to relieve that, Pakistan is blamed or associated with some negative event.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.
Faheem Siddiqi
This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but we know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is in hot water.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden, played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the Parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers movement not played any role?
What do you want say about about the words of the Prime Minister?
Please give us your opinion.
The President of America, George W Bush, told Barack Obama that he in his position made many mistakes and if Obama wants to correct them, he can.
As a president, and based on the situation and rules and regulations of America, I have taken steps to work only for the benefit of America.
He said that the enemies of America are planning today to attack America. To stop this this is the biggest challenge for Barack Obama.
He said that being unable to find the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was a problem, and he felt that saying he won the battle in Iraq was his biggest mistake.
In the last conference given at the White House, he said, "This is my last press conference, and I thank all those who have attended."
Do you think Obama will repeat the same mistakes that Bush made?
Was Bush too late in accepting the mistakes he made?
Will Obama succeed, in Bush's opinion?

The Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, has once again accused Pakistan of provoking a war.
Pakistan is using terrorism as a state policy.
while addressing a Chief Ministers conference in New Delhi, Manmohan Singh said that the terrorist elements are backed by neighboring countries, especially Pakistan.
The terrorists behind the Mumbai attacks used the pelagic route and were safe from the Indian Coast Guard.
The Indian Prime Minister said that the November attacks were carried out by Lashkare Taiba.
He added that the terrorists are using modern techniques and the latest communication systems and said, "We'll have to be more rigorous over the line of control where the intrusion takes place". He said that terrorism will not be tolerated in any case and that is their policy.
How do you see this allegation from the Indian Prime Minister?
Does the internal Political strife and individualism show that India is in trouble?
On what basis has India warned others?
Please give us your suggestions.

This is the most dangerous situation where Isreal kills Palestinians, on the other hand the same in Kashmir also, it was not noted by any peace councils, and not even responding for this
The Associations in Kashmir and Palestian have to fight for their freedom, and they must unite and struggle with dangerous situations. One day their struggle will result in good. Insha Allah
In Ghaza, the Israeli air force attacks Palestine and many people have died.
The important Political Person of HAMAS Nazariyan has killed along with his family.
On the other side the functions of the peace councils were closed, without any conclusion.
The conference was conducted against Isreal by Libya and other gulf countries, and the report was submitted to America
For the last few days there have been bombings by Israeli planes on the Palestinian civilian population.
The whole world cried out regarding the Mumbai issue, but the Israeli attacks do not seem a massacre to anyone including America and Britain.
Why are the important Islamic countries quiet?
What do you want to say about this double standard of the world?
Saeed, New York.
I think that actually, most of our people are illiterate. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties. The electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has taken a serious position.
On the other hand, there was an increase of an average of 18% in gas prices, while the unavailability of petrol in some cities has become a source of lament for the public.
Among the manufacturing and business circles, there are strong protests and severe protests against the long power cut and gas crisis.
Industrialist have given an ultimatum before closing the factories.
Here there is growing anxiety among those dwelling in  Karachi because of eight to ten hours electricity load shedding.
Industrial activities have almost stopped completely.
Government departments are playing a blame game on each other.
Isn't under these circumstance the proposals for increasing electricity and gas tariff a joke with the people?
Why is attention not being given in resolving the issues?
Can the government see the failing of the country's economy?
To solve these problems in the short term, what suggestions do you have?
Please give us your opinion.
Imran Khokar from Madina Munawara Saudi Arabia: I want to say that with the way people are, they get similar leaders.
I am surprised that government is carrying slogan of public service is itself hurting them.
The unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a persecution.
The government has no control over the institutions.
The law and order situation is deteriorating every day, may Allah have mercy on this country.
The new year has started.
Last year was a year of outbreaks and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered for terrorism.

The first anniversary of Benazir Bhutto's death is being observed. She was martyred in an election rally at Liaquat Garden Rawalpindi on December 27, 2007.
Today Benazir is not within us. She was a seasoned politician and a personality of international repute. She had a unique status in the country's politics.
The mystery of her murder has not been solved until today.
Her efforts to establish government and democracy in the country has not been in vain.
Today, a democratic government has been established in Pakistan, and her husband Asif Ali Zardari is president of the state.
How do you see Shaheed Benazir's role in Pakistan's politics?
Who can be behind her martyrdom?
She was recently awarded the global award for human rights. What would you like to say about her political and democratic services?
after ruling America for 8 years, president Bush has departed from the White House and shifted to the president camp office in Camp David so that the White House can be renovated according to the new president Barrack Obama's likings.
During Bush's eight years rule, the historical attacks and destruction of the World Trade Center, attack on Pentagon and then in the name of war against terror, attacking Afghanistan and Iraq and involving forces from other countries into the war and use of American resources in it have become memorable examples of his time.
Due to this war, America itself faced the worst ever economical and financial crisis in history.
What do you think the world achieved and lost as a result of this war?
Were the policies of Bush successful?
What is your opinion on president Bush's rule?
The Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one-day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, in an interview with Jeev News said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour, but due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step? Should sports not be separated from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that the security conditions are so bad in India, the England cricket team is continuing its tour. So why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this?
Salman, Karachi.
Those people who are proud about going to India
and who make their films and videos over there, should now have their eyes opened as to how much the people of India respect them.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami should return to Pakistan the first chance he gets because he was not respected elsewhere.

India's attitude has changed after the Bombay Attacks.
Jagjit Singh has shown by his reaction that he hates Pakistan and the Pakistanis.
One should know that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsley. How is he a bad singer now? Adnan Sami should stay in India, there is no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshaad Alam
Karachi, On the statement of Jagjit Singh, I would only say that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! Open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Mumbai incident, angry statements have increased there. Now people are saying bad things about the famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to foreign news agencies, in the farewell trip of American President George Bush, during a press conference with the Prime Minister Nur-al-Maliki, in his office, the situation became hilarious when an Iraqi journalist called Bush saying "Dog, this is a farewell kiss."
After this, the journalist took his shoe off and threw it at Bush. President Bush ducked with expertise and saved himself from getting hit by the shoe.
The second shoe hit the American flag.
Security agents pulled this journalist away from the president.
On this occasion, President Bush said that he did not know why he did that.  The shoe was size ten, he was not bothered.
In your opinion, does this action of the journalist show the anger of the Iraqi public against President Bush?
What do you think about this incident?
After the Mumbai terror incidents, the tension in Indo-Pak relations escalated to a grave extent, when Indian Air Force war planes violated Pakistani air space in the Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
Due to the reaction of the Pakistani Air Force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
According to sources, both Indian planes were full of weapons and ammunition.
This is the first of its kind incident in the current tensed situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that it is ready to defend the country.
Information Minister Sherry Rahman says that Indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed, although this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
In your opinion, does India really have an intention of air strike on Pakistan?
Is this statement of India correct? Was this violation  a mistake or was this to find out the ability of Pakistan Air force?
Is this incident not going to aggravate the current estrangement among the two countries?

Respected martyr Benazir Bhutto was given the International Award for Human Rights after her death, which was received by her son and chairperson of the People's Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
During a session of the General Assembly in the United Nations headquarters, the former prime minister of Pakistan, martyr Benazir Bhutto, was presented with this award for acknowledgment of her efforts for human rights in a ceremony.
The 60th anniversary of the passing of the human rights resolution by the United Nations was celebrated on the 10th of December.
Among those people and institutes being recognized for their human rights work, apart from Benazir Bhutto, were former American Attorney General, Louis Ramsey Clark and Human Rights Watch, an organisation that works around the world for human rights.
On this occasion, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Abdullah Husain Harun, and other senior embassy agents were present.
What do you say about the former martyr Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto receiving this award?
Samir

It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she completely changed.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party and made her son the representative of Peoples Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi, This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
As long as the iron ax is fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are just like this, that they are adopting secretive ways. This is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations has included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed and two other Pakistani citizens, and that of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organizations in their list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaidah and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, practically non-existent organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba Operation Chief, Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organisations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organizations, restrict their trave. and arrest them.
They will have to face charges.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India accusing these organizations of being responsible for the Mumbai Attacks without any proof?
Why doesn't India have any local terrorist groups?
Aren't the world organizations aware of the persecution of minorities in India?
