Supporting the French Proposal
The meeting of the committee took place in the parliament house under the chairmanship of the committee chairman Mushahid Husain Syed, in which they proposed to the government to send a delegation, with representatives of all political parties apart from the humanitarian aid to Palestine.
Speaking to representatives of the press after the meeting, Mushahid Husain Syed said that the committee welcomed the proposal given by France, in which it was stated that Israel calls for an immediate ceasefire and allows humanitarian work among the affected people of Gaza.
Calling the Israeli attacks on Palestine a crime against humanity, he said that all countries should criticize these attacks.
Mushahid Husain made the double standards of the countries of the world a target of his attack, and asked why are those who speak against terrorism, quiet about the Israeli attacks on Palestine?
The chairman of the standing Committee of External Affairs in the Senate also targeted the leaders of Muslim nation who were taking a quiet stance on the matter of Palestine.
He said that the committee expressed hope that the newly elected American President Barack Obama would speak to the Muslim nation within the first 100 days of his government, in order to bridge the gulf forming between American and the Muslim nation.
Mushahid Husain Syed said that the gap formed between the Muslim nation and the West should be filled by taking not only sudden steps but also by solving long standing issues like that of Kashmir and Palestine.
The minister of foreign affairs, Malik Imad, told the committee that he was going to Saudi Arabia to attend the meeting of the foreign ministers of the governments of Islamic countries.

The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the issue of Palestine should be resolved in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations.
Two journalists from Arab countries also joined the conference and talked about the latest situation in Palestine.
In Islamabad, students at the International University demonstrated in protest against the Israeli attacks on Palestine.

Abstain From Dieting To Avoid Flu
This finding by American scientists resulted from experimentation on rats.
It was demonstrated in these experiments that rats on low-calorie diets had lessened ability to resist the flu virus.
Research has proven wrong the old belief that it is good to fast when one has a fever.
According to the scientists, one should eat a lot when one has a fever.
The researchers, who work at Michigan State University, say that rats who were dieting had a lessened ability to resist infection and had an increased mortality rate, whereas rats on a normal dietary regimen had better resistance against the flu virus.
In many modern countries it has for sometime been fashionable to think that, by free education for all-whether rich or poor, clever or stupid-, one can solve all the problems of the society.
But we can already see that free education for all is not enough. We find in such countries a far larger number of people with University degrees than there are jobs for them to fill.
This plan of education was implemented on 1990.
Because of their degrees, they refuse to do what they think low work and in fact work with the hands is thought to be dirty and shameful in such countries.
The work of a completely uneducated farmer is far more important than that of a professor: we can live without education, but we die if we have no food. If no one cleaned our streets and took the rubbish away from our houses, we should get terrible diseases in our towns.
In fact, when we say that all of us must be educated to fit us for life, it means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited.
Education is not an end but a means to an end. In other words we do not educate children only for the purpose of educating them.
When men become organized into very large groups, a civilization develops.
It is possible to get freedom from hunger, thirst, cold, heat and many diseases, so that each person can live a happier life than he could.
It means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited to his brain and ability, and secondly, that we can realize that all jobs are necessary to society and that it is very bad to be ashamed of ones work or to scorn someone elses.
He further said that on May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with a lot of care and that Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.
When Thomas Reed was asked a question on whether China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan, he replied that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.
He said that there is evidence that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan has used the Chinese model. Later the documents received from Libya also confirm this.
Another question that is it common is on nuclear experiments. He said that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.
He said that we also predicted that Israel has access to the results of this experiment.
Thomas Reeds was also asked if China is continuing nuclear proliferation.
Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw materials, instructions and designs to a nuclear facility of Iran in its city Asfahan.
Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.
He said that China had been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Rome, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen via North Korea.

There was a Protest against the removal of journalists
On Tuesday the organization of journalists RIUJ held protests in front of the Islamabad Press Club against media owners and the government about the news channel and newspapers removing many of their employees.
Speaking to the protesters, senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, Federal Union of Journalists, C.R. Shamsi said that the politicians used to protest with us until yesterday on the streets, today they have become rulers and are sitting in the parliament. Fearing a certain lobby of the media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of the journalists.
He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.
An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.
He said that there should be firm steps taken against the TV and newspaper owners, and the journalists should put a protest camp in front of the parliament to get their rights.
C.R. Shamsi criticized the governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, saying that employees were removed from his Urdu Newspaper "Aaj Kal" staff without prior notice.

He said that until now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been removed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is being feared that the owners will remove hundreds more in the present year, making an excuse of the present financial crisis.
Mazhar Abbas has said that the journalists' movement will continue unless the dismissed workers are restored.

Virus Attacks 3.5 Million Users
Discovered for the first time in October 2008, this virus is known by names like Confecker, Down and Up, and Kido.
Microsoft had released a patch to tackle this virus; but, despite that, almost 3.5 million computers and memory sticks have been affected with it.
The experts say that the number of affected computers can be a lot more.
To handle this, the users need to use Microsoft's MS08067 patch.
According to Microsoft, this virus which infected millions of computers, locates the services.exe file in Windows and then gets into its code.
Afterwards, this virus turns into a DLL type of file into the System folder of Windows.
It also creates the name of this file as well.
Then it changes the registry details of Windows.
After getting activated, this virus creates a problem which rises as an http server and changes the restore point of the system.
Afterwards, it downloads the files from the maker's website.
According to Microsoft, this virus has infected computers in different countries of the world.
These countries include China, Brazil, Russia, India, America and Britain.
The advantages of such an agreement are great.
By his own nature as a man; this is my attack him, and death will certainly come to him sooner or later.
Any man can become a doctor, knowing that others will grow food, make clothes, and build a house for him.
When men become organized in civilization, it is possible to be freed from hunger, thirst, cold, and heat.
so that he can live happily with the others.
A man living alone in a desert or forest is free from other people; but he is not absolutely free.
His freedom is limited in several ways; first, by the things around him, such as wild animals or cliffs too steep to climb.
second, by his own needs: he must have sleep, water, food and shelter from extreme heat or cold.
When men live together, on the other hand, protection against wild animals is easier and they can work together to get food and build shelters; but each man has to give up some of his freedom.
I agree to respect the rights of others, and in return they agree to respect mine.

Let it be known that a three member investigation team has been formed in the leadership of the Additional Director General of the FIA. The information about the Mumbai attacks given by India
to Pakistan is being verified by this team.
The High Commission of Pakistan, Shahid Malik, met President Asif Ali Zardari, in which meeting the President made it clear that if any Pakistani group or individual is found guilty in the Mumbai attacks, action will be taken against them according to the country law.  No one would be handed over to India. This, is all taking place when the Indian government is continuously pressuring Pakistan to hand over the guilty people.

Members of the Republican Party said that the economic plan is very expensive and will not prove effective.
240 votes were cast in favor of this package in the members assembly whereas 160 were cast against it.
This economic revival plan will be presented next week in the Senate where the ruling Democratic party has very little majority.
Concern is being expressed that great opposition from the Republican Party may make it difficult to obtain Senate approval.
After the approval of economic revival plan, Barack Obama insisted that this important plan should not cause political disagreement.
The president said that this plan, which hoped would be enacted by next month, will prove to make a peaceful atmosphere in the country and enhance the American economy.
According to this plan, the public will be forgiven of loans from $275 billion to $540 billion for roads, bridges, 10,000 schools, unemployment benefits and research for new technology.
BBC writer Richard Luster has said in Washington that Barack Obama intended to introduce a new political culture by eliminating political disagreements, but discussion about this economic package has once again made politicians sore.
Republican party members in the assembly declared the bill that was proposed from the government, a waste of government money. They also said that this will not help in creating new vacancies.
They insisted on the bill proposed by their party, which attention has been given to relaxation in taxes.
They said that through their package, less investment can create more chances of livelihood.
They said that instead of construction plans, relaxation in taxes can instantly create more number of vacancies/
Bitterness among Israeli president and Turkish Prime Minister
Rajab Tayyab Erdogan almost shouted at Israeli President and said that many people's blood have been shed in Gaza. He  felt sorrow watching that people can actually clap on the reason of this military action from Israel.
Mr. Erdogan said "I think you are using such words to erase your guilt and that in a high voice. But you killed people and I am remembering those children who were killed near the shore."
Shamoon Parez said that Gaza's pain is not Israel, it is Hammas who has founded dangerous dictatorship there.
A correspondent of BBC from Davis says that nothing like this has been seen before in an international economic forum.
Although later Erdogan said that he respects the Israeli president and also his age, due to which he did not shout at him, but what he was saying was miles away from truth.
Turkey is one of the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, but for the last few years there has been tension between them.
The Attacks Were Not Planned In Pakistan.
Speaking to an Indian news channel, NDTV, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said that the report of the Pakistani investigations into the Mumbai blast will be prepared soon.
In the attacks that took place in Mumbai, last November, more than 170 persons were killed.
India claims that the responsibility for the attacks belongs to the extremist group, Lashkar-e-Taiba.
India also said that Pakistani 'state factors' were guilty in the Mumbai attacks.
After the Mumbai attacks, the relations between the two countries were affected.
The high commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan gave his first statement about the report of the Pakistani investigations, from which it becomes evident as to what is within the report.
Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that as far as the investigation has gone, Pakistani land has not been used.
It must be some other place not including England.
These were the two places (Pakistan and Britain), about which I was in doubt.
India and the global brotherhood has put considerable pressure on Pakistan, to take action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan says that it has arrested dozens of people during the action against groups which were clearly involved in the Mumbai attacks.
Wahid Shamsul Hasan said: We are not trying to cover this up.
We believe in acting upon facts.
Our investigations will be accepted by the world.
We will try to satisfy India with the results (of the investigation).
Defending the delay in the Pakistani investigations, he said that to gather, understand and verify such matter takes time.
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that India took 45 days to hand over its dossier.

The Role Played by European Union for Peace in Middle East.
Looking at it from a governmental point of view, the efforts by the European Union to end the wars of the Middle East have been decisive.
The Shoarzan Berg Group or Sarkozy's efforts are symbolic to the seriousness of the matter, according to Brussels' official position.
The European Commission's Spokeperson Amadeu Altafa said that every effort is commendable and that can help a unified message from the European Union to reach the warring sides.
In light of the governments statement, everything thus far seems to be fine.
However, in reality, the European Union is presenting a view of conflict amongst each other, an idea that is very sad.
European Union's President Check Repuplic's role is already weak.
In addition, the internal turmoil has nullified the effect.
On the other side, French President Sarkozy's role seems to indicate that he is still working as the president of the European Union.
Despite the fact that France's 6-month presidential term has ended.
Sarkozy wants to play a leader's role, a job he can do well, but he lacks the authorization to do it.
The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, is faced with a strange situation.
He is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of the Czech Republic, Schwarzenberg.
The problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the Middle East war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense, whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. Moreover, Germany has sent its special ambassador to the Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.
Its proof is the Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.
This is a golden chance for the European Union to do something since America, due to the policies of George W. Bush, has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial Crisis: Suicide of a billionaire German industrialist.
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany, left a huge business group behind him.
But, a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.
When he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines. Then he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700,000 to one billion euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle faced a lot of pressure.
Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had gotten to this position by going from being a small producer to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic powet.
After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quickly, putting it on a new track.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion euros a year. After the superb success of Ratiopharm, the Merkel group started buying many other institutions, which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement and car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is nearly 100,000; and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical manufacturer Ratiopharm, always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine."
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks sanctioned 400 million euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it can improve its financial conditions in the long term.
Therefore, after Adolf Merkeley's demise the Merkeley Group, which once existed, came to an end.
According to new statistics, the crime rate among the immigrants in Germany,
if compared with other countries, between 2004 and 2007
dropped from 22.9%
to 21.4%
In the view of Joachim Herrmann, the minister for home affairs of Baaveria, it has been a positive change.
He said: It is to be noted that the number of aspirants seeking German citizenship has increased.
The statistics would have mentioned the fact that most of the persons indulging in the crimes are Germans.
Based on this, a foreigner said when statistics of crime are taken in his homeland in 2010, the above mentioned factors will be taken for consideration by Herrmann.
Mentions have been made in his letters about Humberg except Baaveria.
Christoph Ahlhaus, an internal affair's senator belong to CDU, said, ""When one does research in a scientific manner, then the results can not be predetermined. The results are based on the figures and numbers which are the outcome of the research.
Ahlhaus brought the attention towards an analysis report of 2006 prepared by a regional (provincial) office of Crime Prevention, in view of which it was calculated that in the crimes happening from bergdorf to hamburg, what is the percentage of foreigners involved.
From the results it was found out that the foreigners
crime percentage is less compared to the overall crime rate of the whole province.
In contrast to this calculation, when in 2006 in Berlin, the teenage crime rates were analyzed, it was found that the teenagers having a foreign background was 7.44%
was 7.44 %
However certain political parties of Germany for example SPD, the environmentalist party The Greens, and the Left party Linkspartei (Die Linke) , are against the idea of collecting information about whether certain German citizens are foreigners or not, while collecting facts about crimes and crime rates.

Mehr News Agency related from Associated Press that the American President George Bush, in the last press conference of his term, accepted numerous mistakes and crimes.
Speaking during the press conference at the White House, President Bush said that though newly-elected president Obama has the feelings of well wishing, still, the biggest challenge facing Obama would be to prevent possible attacks on America.
He said that the completion of the Iraq mission and social security reforms were his mistakes.
President Bush said that whatever he did, he did it for the sake of protecting America.
Upon being asked various questions about the Israeli inflictions on Gaza, President Bush said that Israel has the right to defend itself. According to him, Hamas does not have the right to defend itself and Hamas should not do anything to Israel, and like America, the whole world should choke the oppressed rather than the oppressor.
The incapable and despicable president of the United States said that Hamas should not be given weapons either, while America is providing Israel the world's most destructive weapons. Israel is using American weapons to massacre Palestinians and Bush also praised Israel supporting Arabs, calling them the friends of Israel.
Bush expressed shame at some of the crimes going on in the Abu Ghraib and Guantanemo jails.
People are opining that cases should be filed against Bush for his war crimes, and that the organizations which manage to do this will have done a great service to humanity.
The Iranian President Ahmedinejad expressed sorrow over the silence of the Arab leaders.
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, the Iranian President Mahmood Ahmadinejad criticized the Arab leaders' silence over the Israeli inhumanity and oppression on Gaza, expressing his sorrow.
President Ahmadinejad said, expressing surprise over the Arab countries and their leaders' silence over the beastly acts of Israel, that Israel is subjecting the Palestinian public to a holocaust. They are making the Palestinian children, women and civilians targets of their barbarianism, and the Arab leaders have not even given one statement.
The president Ahmade Nazad said that All Arab countries should form a union against Israel and save the unjustly treated Muslims from atrocities and unjust treatment they receive from Israel.
The king of Saudi Arabia, Ahmade Nazad should express his views on the killing of civilians by Israel in Ghaza.
According to expert news sources The President Mahmood Ahmade Zazad sent a message to the Saudi Arabian King Abdullah that his non addressing of the killing of Muslims and and other civilians by Israel in Ghaza, the kill of innocent children and women does one thing, it encourages the enemy of Islam.
The President Ahmade Nazad said in the message that all Muslim nations need to show their resolve and to help the unjustly treated by removing the war effort of the enemy of Islam and make dispute between the Muslim Umma and the Israelis.
The President Ahmade Nazad said in the message that Israel has been killing Muslim civilians for 19 days. They have been killing innocent children openly and bombing houses, mosques, schools and hospitals. Other non Mulsims are killing openly and it encourages Israel to continue the carnage.

The American President George Bush brings the danger for terrorist attacks on America.
It is narrated by a news source based in Germany that the American president George Bush said in his last speech to his successor, Barak Obama and also telling the United States that America is not safe from terrorism although it has remained safe for the last 7 years.
According to Mr. Bush, terrorists are eager and prepared to attack America when the time is right. Therefore, the United States should not demonstrate negligence in regard to national security.
The President of the United States has ignored the suffering of millions of Palestinian people, continuing to defend his aggressive and unethical policies. The President states that even today, the U.S. is the largest country that supports freedom, but experts tend to disagree. Experts are of the opinion that this claim is not realistic because not only is the U.S. not the flag bearer of freedom, it is also not a supporter of human rights. In fact, the U.S. is the largest terrorist country in the world that not only is supporting barbaric Israeli Government, but also is directly involved with Israel in committing crimes.
Israel is causing a massacre by slaughtering men, women, and children while the President of the United States supports this behavior. This is the "humanity and freedom"; the America that the world sees in Gaza and all across the planet.

Tea: Effective cure of Chest Cancer
In a new research study there are claims that drinking 3 cups of tea everyday
reduces the danger of chest cancer in women under 50 years of age by 1/3rd.
Research at the Moffitt Cancer Center in the American State of Florida, has showed that chances of getting chest cancer in those women under 50 years of age
who drink at least three cups of tea everyday is reduced by 37%.
The research study also claims that it does not help older women even if they drink three or more cups of tea daily.
Specialists think that this is because of the presence of such components in tea that are more effective against the types of cancer tumors which usually target women under 50 years of age.
Research was done on 5000 women who had Breast Cancer treatment at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa,Florida.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
Specialists compared their medical records and lifestyles to those women who were free of breast cancer.
Specialists also found that tea had the most effect on one specific kind of breast cancer, Lobes.  It reduced the risk by 66%.
One on every ten breast cancer patients has this kind of cancer.
This type of breast cancer is dangerous because it is deep inside and usually only diagnosed when it has become widespread.
Specialists found that having at least three cups of tea every day can readily reduce the chances of breast cancer in women of younger ages.
They found that incorporating tea as a regular drink in your daily routine helps create immunity against the cancer.
Almost 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in Britain.

Why reduce exercise with the age?
new research
exercise at any age is good for health.
Exercise energizes your heart, reduces your cholesterol level, helps in keeping your weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer or dementia.
Unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.
experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active, however, age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.
Dr. Patricia Palecca of the Mayo Clinicin  Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to exercise and lack of bodily activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.
She led a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.
The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the workings of the heart.
The pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.
The experts focused on the left part of the heart, which is the main part for pumping blood.
They learned that as people grow old, there is an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.
Dr. Patricia says that as age increases, the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear, and this affects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garwin  Cain was also a part of this study.
He says that they were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this. And this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.
If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart, they can achieve the benefits of excercise, despite the increase in age.
A detailed report of this has been published in the American Medical Association's magazine.
There are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief.
The chief of the Indian Army, General Deepak Kapoor has stated that there are no chances of immediate war with Pakistan. However, to serve the country and protect its interests, the Indian Army is always ready.
General Kapoor has made the accusation that despite ascertainments and the international pressure on Pakistan due to the Mumbai attacks, the terrorist's structure is not only the same in Pakistan, but it is also active.
He said this in an interview to journalists in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day trip to the Kashmir valley to inspect the situation of the overall security situation in Kashmir, which is under New Delhi's management, and to check the preparations of the armed forces at the border.
He was asked what his reaction was to the media reports which state that Pakistan refuted the proof presented by India about the Mumbai attacks.
He stated that the matters of peace and war are decided by the political leadership.
Talking about terrorism in the land of Pakistan, he allegedly said that India will fight against the forces that are trying to destroy peace and weaken India.
He said that there are around 700 to 800 fighters present in Indian Kashmir, of whom almost 50% are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that the governmental efforts of encroachment between Pakistan and Kashmir would be increased only when the weather improved, although India has increased security on the boarders.
They have refused the possibility of reducing the number of army soldiers in Indian Kashmir by stating that one can not compromise over the country's security.
May God answer the world's prayers that Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, we shall see if the relationship between America and Pakistan is affected in our favor by this change.
What will Mr. Barrack Obama give to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams?
Obama - whose middle name is Hussein - becoming president of America is historically important in many ways, and is also a great challenge.
Not only for himself but also for those who supported him with all their hearts.
It will also be challenging be for the white majority as it is not easy for them to accept that a colored man is ruling over them.
Those here in South Asia, especially the Muslims, who have hopes about him should remember that he was elected the president of America, and Obama should remember that the president of America is actually the president of the world.
A person whose real brothers were brought to America from their own countries, wearing the neckband of slavery, and whose blood and sweat watered the roots of the strongest country of the new era will be called the 44th President.
Many people have many expectations from this man.
It is necessary for those who admire him not to have unrealistic expectations for him.
If Obama is even somewhat successful in reducing the hate that is spread on ethnic and religious grounds, it will be a victory for his admirers.
What effect will this change have on South Asia, and what considerable change can be expected in American policy in this regards?
How will these changes affect Pakistani-American relations?
?
Sir, whether it be Obama or someone else, the type of policies with regards to the whole world are decided by the multi-billionaire, influential, strong Jewish lobby.
As for Pakistan, with regards to the recent Mumbai blasts, the injurious actions taken by India, Israel and America has been seen by the whole world.
Even after the creation on Pakistan, the governance of Swat was in the hands of its King, who even had his own army and law.
With the help of an agreement they transferred the administration of Swat to the Pakistani government.
But, it is disheartening to know that our government treated Swat like how a step mother would treat another's child.
After the end of the governance of the King, there were no more schools founded in Swat.
Also, the areas development was not given any notice either.
Currently, the number of girls acquiring education is far less than in previous years.
The Taliban is continuing their attacks on educational institutions in the NWFP.
Swat has suffered the highest number of schools destroyed, and the majority of them have been all girls schools.
To make matters worse, the Taliban has also announced a ban on education for girls.
Thousands of students are being deprived of education.
what do you think, by stopping girl's education, what the Taliban want to achieve?
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities until today?
what do you think the government should do?
the question should be that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
because the people of Swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them, otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that during the Curfew. How come people can be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing.
when the writ of the government is not being let implemented, how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities?
now the question arises that having an armed force, armed with modern weapons, modern technologies and intelligence system, why the government can not control these few Taliban.
the only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head, that neither their arms end nor they are apprehended.
result of the discussion is that Taliban with their wrong steps are making it easier for the imperialists.
fifteen years before the war was continued in Afghanistan.
ISI used to control the Taliban when there was opposition from the Northern Alliance, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then, suddenly the situation changed when Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of Dollars from America, so the previous friend became an enemy.
The situation has changed but the war continues and those supporting the ISI in Pakistan are still Russia, India and Iran.
Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he will continue to make mistakes.
For instance, if a thief realizes when he goes to steal on object that stealing is wrong-- that it is a curse and it will bring punishment-- and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong by spilling the blood of the innocent, and that it will receive punishment for this, it will continue to play Holi with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings
The question is this; is war, armed resistance; and terrorism the solution to problems?
If not, then what is the magic recipe that will bring out a solution to the problems?
It is right that war is a very destructive practice that never solves problems, but actually increases them.
Palestine, Afghanistan, and Iraq should adopt practices used by Nelson Mandela in South Africa in order to gain independence.
These nations, should fight more for social, ethical, and subjective change, rather than armed resistance.
Kashmiri's participation in the current election process shows that they have accepted this point.
Israeli attacks have gone on in Gaza for 3 weeks, and the death toll has reached 1000.
World diplomacy efforts still to this day have not resulted in a cease fire.
And according to one survey, attacks after the 27th of December have resulted in 90,000 Palestinians leaving their homes and moving towards safer havens.
On the other hand, NGOs has accused Israel of not taking care of Palestine's kids, and said that a whole generation of Palestinian kids are in serious psychological and emotional trouble.

The Taliban should be given a chance.
basit, Peshawar
Please wake up! If the Taliban started doing the real Jihad, then who will kill the innocent people?
Who will burn down the girls' schools?
Who will do kidnapping for ransom, or if the ransom is not paid, then blame people of being American agents and hang them on the towers?
These Taliban members have brought more damage to Islam than any nation or religion has ever brought.
Pashtoon Rore
Kohat, Pakistan
If the whole Muslim world just gave a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see how upset will father America will be.
And immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well.
But what can be done? Where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from?
Someone tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step, as he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
The responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on Arab and the Muslim worlds but its the obligation of the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny.
This unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
Just like in Pakistan and India before 30th June or the end of the fiscal year, the government institutions are looted, the American regime just before its end have given a green signal to Israel to do what ever it wants.
On one hand America says that effort will be made for ceasefire.
On the other side, the United Nations is passing one resolution after another which have done nothing, so in effect the United Nations is also working to crush the Muslims.
All the Islamic Countries should cancel their membership in United Nations and lay the foundation of their own international organization.
There are many examples of promises and resolutions by America and the United Nations where only the Muslims suffered.
What is the advantage of these actions when BBC does not have to print anything.
Where have the principles of journalism been buried?  When the blood starts flowing, especially of Muslims, the ghost of unbiased reporting starts riding over the BBC.
Otherwise portrays itself as the flag bearer of righteousness.
They don't even want comments about how something they said is completely wrong.
For the Muslims.
The difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and Martyr the Muslims, while people like you live among Muslims, calling yourselves Muslims.
[syja786]
Long time since, in the forums of BBC, a specific cult has been targeted sometimes in suicide attacks and sometimes in terrorism occurring in India
Extremism is the favorite word for those anti-islamic comments.
But by viewing the above comment, you can easily differentiate who is the actual extremist, in which almost a Fatwa of blasphemy has been pronounced for writing against Iran.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal can't be fought with the help of the sword.
After watching Israel's bombings on unarmed people, what would one's tear-filled heart do?
But the actual blame should go to that terrorism and violence, which we state as Jihad and ruin the beautiful name of Islam.
Since the majority of Palestinians have already accepted the existence of Israel, does it make sense for Hamas to fire rockets on Israel or send in suicide bombers?
Behavior from both sides lack humanity.
The character played by America and United Nations has repeatedly showed us their support for the cruelties of Israel.
May ALLAH grant us, the Muslims, a way to re-unite. Amen.
The real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism. After all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are.
So this situation, in common terms, is called DADAGEERI, which means do what ever you can.
It hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry.
Medicine for the injured and coffins for the dead are being supplied by the Arab leaders and in case
the Israeli attacks should take place.
This is the actual problem. The leaders of Muslim countries, including the Saudi crown prince are in a false sleep. They have an neither an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
They should take immediate measures against Israel.
For example, stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Salam to All brothers and sisters!
i think at this hard time advising hammas to stop struggling in the name of peace would be injustified with thousands of widows and millions of orphans, and it would be similar to prove them wrong.
If israel and its followers are at peak of cruelty then soon a revolution to stop all this is going to show up because this is the law of nature. America and isreal's steps are upbringing suicide bombers.
They can can not understand who are blind in trance of power.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Now Hammas and Israel should befriended to stop blood shed.
Muhammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France.
very rightly said.
Assumingly if hammas is 100% right and by fighting against malice it gets higher place in the eyes of God even then atleast they should realize if by good deeds peace of others home is shattered then that act is no longer a good deed.
Those who claim to love God, His Prophet(P.B.U.H) and their religion, to love humanity is part of their belief.
Consequently after Muslim's confiscation of everybody on earth is Allah's order.
Najibur Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
There are no orders to destroy but there are invites for them to come to Islam.
Jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion.
These people should be fought against unless they stop these conspiracies. This doesn't mean that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering.
The only end to the killer of innocent children is destruction.
I ask my friends about the Israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past. They have become so strong today that they don't listen to any one. This is because the Jews are united.
There are no Sheas and Sunnis. There are all just Jews and they have developed everything in every field.
What is the condition of 55 Islamic countries?
They are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death.
it is essential that all Muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
and there is no better strategy, that recognize Israel, learn modern education and means of progress and let the world live in peace and harmony.
The Muslims have plenty of land and means as well.
the need is of proper use.
The first and most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque.  This was impossible without getting Yasin and Arafat out of the way.
The world is witnessing that Palestine had been scattered after the death of these two leaders.
and how the Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
In 1974 a Pakistani Prime Minister was so trusted worldwide that for the first time in history he manged to gather all the Muslim leaders under one roof with hundred percent attendance.
Today on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task for the whole nation to promise to keep unity in its lines.
Will the incomplete mission of forming a joint Islamic nation be advanced while still removing the differences between the Muslims?
This is a Jinn, which has entered Palestine for half a century.
That Jinn has many mouths.
Many  times, this Jinn calls itself bad names from one of its other mouths to divert the attention of the world and reduce the pressure of it.
It is another mouth of this Jinn which is eating people in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This Jinn fears Islam the most, as it knows that only Muslims following the complete religion of Islam practically can remove it. History proves that Islam has brought many Abu Jahls to the path.
The series of bombings of Gaza by Israeli war planes and missile strikes has been going on since the 27th of December.
More than three hundred Israeli citizens have died so far in these attacks.
Now, after the air strikes, Israeli tanks have reached the Gaza border prepared to launch a land offensive.
The Security Council of the United Nations, through a resolution passed in an emergency meeting, have demanded that Israeli and Palestinian authorities stop extremist activities immediately.
However, the Israeli authorities say that they will continue their operation in Gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
In your opinion, is Isreal being honest in claiming that it's doing all this to defend the sovereignty of Israel?
Is the world community playing its role in such situation?
Does this aggression have an indirect relation to the coming elections in Israel?
Can any improvement be expected in the situation in Middle East after the succession of the newly elected American president Barak Obama?

B.B.C makes it a point to dig out and publish such accounts.
After all, they have to maintain the illusion and impression of their neutrality.
By the way, B.B.C news is factual but an essential factor is the tone in which the news is delivered.
Which news to be made prominent, and which news to be considered as insignificant.

Now even the electronic media as well as printed media of Pakistan, specifically a few urdu newspapers and columnists, are not behind anybody else in exhibiting this skill- who, while giving coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism, and while writing about it, hide facts about the grudge mafia.
It has been said that United Nations seemingly supports human rights and peace, but actually the muslims are being subjected to extreme levels of cruelty and brutality.  What we hear from the United Nations is that Hamas should stop the attacks. How long will this hypocrisy carry on?
Why there is so much atrocity to Muslims. If people in  America will not stop supporting Jews, Allah Almighty has said that their nation will live a shabby life and can never live a right life. So Americans, if you have the courage, stop backing up the jews or see your fate.
These so-called writers and murderers in name of peace should understand that peace in the world can only be obtained through justice and not through genocides.
If any nations can be perished through genocide and results of choice can be obtained then after actions of Hitler, existence of Jews and their uprising was impossible.
As poet says,
Atrocity is atrocity and it vanishes when it rises.
Blood is blood and it clots when it drops.
Now who can tell what is terrorism?
Why would this be terroism? Because your own pain is the only one felt?
Are not other people human or is it that the blood of Muslims is so cheap?  Or perhaps, the color of these innocent's was not red?
Lastly, why there is no condolence messages coming from anywhere?
I saw the terror acts in Mumbai as my own house was set on fire. It is painful to see the sufferings of humanity.If such sufferings can not be seen by others then may the Muslims think collectively.
Dead bodies on the roads, helpless and wounded people stained with their own blood. How can it be condemned? Words are too poor to express this state.
My heart is crying over the miseries and helplessness of Muslims. On one hand People are being killed in India and on the other hand, without any solid proof, whole world is pressing Pakistan to do more or rather do it themselves.
On the other side Israel is killing Muslims. The silence of the world is intolerable.
It may be delayed but God will surely do the justice to end the dominance of falsehood.
A threat to Israel's security in the presence of US, no way, it's a joke.
In Israel, such tactics are used by ruling party to achieve public support.Historically no president was powerful enough to change American policies. Barrack Obama is no exception. Forces of Exploitation are similar in their character, weather they are black or white.
In this forum of discussion, it is clear that everybody is mourning the death of Benazir but she is not forgiven for her political mistakes.
It is debatable whether Benazir died for democracy or for the lust of Power.
If Democracy was her motto then why did not she come before American clearance? and Why did she leave democracy under the control of Musharraf's dictatorship for 10 years?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the stratocracy public needed her. Unfortunately, she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised.
When each and every historic personality is being accused, there is no one to say any thing about this.

how brutal is our nation, not only are we blind while writing odes on ourselves and our parties, but now we are picking, accusing, and criticizing every historical scholar and noone is there to say any thing over this.
enough of development that we have made.
Sana Khan
few things are ignored just by thinking that nothing can be done of them. Just like a donkey can not become a scholar by just loading books over it.
although after the Mumbai attacks there have been setbacks in the dialog between Pakistan and India, however Pakistan and India should continue these dialogs.
if we talk of war then it will bring loss of humans from both sides.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu but on the other hand when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader, point to be noted.
First of all Merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and to all the Christian brothers of the forum.
greeting to all friends of the Forum: Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, sister Sana, sister Shahida and Mr. Akram.
We want flowers of peace rather than the flame of war.
War is itself a problem.
What solution will the war give?
Today will give fire and blood.
Tomorrow will give hunger and necessity.
For this wise people
It is better that war is postponed.
In our garden it is better that candle stays lit.
In our garden it is better that candle stays lit.
The relationship of India and America has become deep and India knows that when the time comes America will openly deceive Pakistan.
It is the history of America.
However, America will gain it's aims in the Indian attack and the India will expend all.
Pakistan should announce clearly that they will not attack first but when India is the first to strike, there will not be any peace and the war will only come to an end when India is occupied and abolished.
It is the Islamic history.
Before this approval, Pakistani public and force delivered the saying which they wanted.
The Indian efforts of receiving extraordinary ambassador and force benefits in fulfilling Mambai attacks are making It clever party mare than impress so after the first world hard opposite action decreased on Pakistan by the world.
The showing of the United States and the showing betterment of president of Interpol peace of mind at Pakistani efforts by avoiding unnecessary noise of India is the side effect of the extra ambassador of India.
There are no two sayings about this dishonest action.
But the question is, where was the Pakistani force and what was it doing when thousands of Talibans proceeded to attack the village of Pir Same-u-Llah.
Should the content of force not be in action that what they did for their country.
Every day thousands of missiles and bombs have been thrown, due to that, how many Taliban citizens have been killed?
I am Requesting ISI, for god's sake leave the Guardianship of Taliban, and let us live with peace and happiness in our Heaven.
And stop this fake Operation.
In National Unity, the day is not too far when in Pakistan, the military affirmative will be passed as it has been passed against jamiat-ul-dawa
Riyaz Ahmed Farooqui
First our intemperance lovers and there supporters are collecting the evidence continuously for legal act are been provided, if any day any affirmative comes across then there are lot of possibilities that in the National unity there will be no one to raise a voice to support us
If suppose there is any delay for Affirmative to be passed then we can keep an example of America in front, so that any one of the power will join us to walk with us
We dont have the consciousness and Knowledge of Peer Sami ul llah his Personality and his Adventures and what work he was busy in
He probably  was not a revolutionary
As Kamri dach gaveera, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr Najeeb ul llah and thousands of Revolutionarys Dead bodies have been disgraced by enemies hands.
They command even after they die.
There is an international game being played over here. Here, they are ruling by scaring the public about beastliness and terror.
In order that it would be permissible for them they said that if we are not there beasts and wild people will come and capture the government.
Such actions of the so-called "Islam lovers" in the name of religion is extremely disagreeable.
The supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of America, but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions, they give it the name of tribal traditions and clearly avoid it.
Any person with a heart can never accept these beastly actions that are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of Islam.
I think the people of our army have joined these people.
This is because when these people move around at least some of the time they will be taken. To catch them will only take so much time, but forget about getting to their spot. Even if they were there they would escape from there.
Are these people so brave that they can take 50 or 70 people hostage and our army watches them like an audience, with hand on hand?
They are also servants of Allah and so is the army.
It is clear that something is sinister.
During the dictatorship of Ziya ul Haq, an atmosphere of religo-phobia was created.  Instead of spreading  the merciful and noble aspects of religion, he stressed on many types of punishment including hanging. This atmosphere of fear and terror was being reinforced through  published literature as well.
And these people are only using this fear as a tool or a weapon to gain worldly pleasures and honor.
preachers!
As you have preached against the fire of Hell
that you have yourself become the face of fear.
It is surprising when it is said that this cannot be the work of a Muslim
We are either unaware of our own history, or we ignore it for some reason.
Upon the death of the Prophet, instead of refusing to pledge allegiance, people burnt the house of the daughter of the Messenger and killed her husband.
Had they come from somewhere outside?
Was the strike on Madeena and Great Karbala the work of Hindus and Jews?
Without the submission of the truth nor the movement was away neither the check.
BBC closes quadrant policy.
The super hit title for this subject: "Was Bush being hit with the shoes legal or illegal?"
Supposedly.
Tahir Chaudhry, Japan
Friend, have some shame!  People have taken a human being from the grave and hung him on a pole just because he raised his voice against wrongfulness, and you are concerned about the title of the box office.
Normal people have a favorable opinion following the victory of the operation in Sherdil, and on the other side of the border the victorious invasion of the operation Lion Heart.
Peer Sahib was the target of the American and Pakistan Agencies' conspiracy.
Now all the criticism is going to be against the Taliban because undercover people within the Taliban have been very successful, and are taking steps where normal people can change their opinions.
I have only the question of the day that what will the force be doing when the dead body was hanging the whole day,are they sitting in country to kill the normal people those say like this two children and thier mother dead by bombing on Taliban houses.
Did they not know about that "chowk"?
Or they were seeing an action film?
We say it with the excuse that we must stop this game for Allah's sake.
At last, there is a commander upon you as well.
A question raised from BBS if it is not reasonable but alas on the sow thinking of writers,.for example it was asked from any person that for what purpose the force went Swaaat containing 30000 persons.
...that the dead bodies of the helpers of force fighting with the Taliban remain hanged on poles all the day.
What did the Pakistani force with Swati public what did but the media contain BBC did the world unknowing about real matter and it was not good.
The Pakistani force is making drama.
Every child of Swaat is saying that this is a blood drama.
Please stop this drama, for God's sake.
The Taliban has destroyed the name of Muslims.
If the Muslims take over the whole world they won't have any place to leave the terror from.
Those aren't interested in doing work or in living a peaceful life, and they take guns and join those people
Islam hasn't come under the pressure of a gun or sword.
Shame on you.
There is no reason for this in any religion or in any families.
BBC along with other media's have gathered information about the Taliban.
The reality is not known to any one, and what the real situation is we only know because we are tribals.
Basically it's a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD, and our ISI, are involved, there is no one in from the Taliban or from tribal. It was created by terror from above agencies, who are insulting the Taliban, Islam, Madarsa's, Pestos, and Tribals.
due to this action Muslims head down with shyness.
i salute MQM Leader Altaf Hussain, ANP and PPP leaders who are against this cancer it means talk against Taliban.
this cancer creates by Ziaulhaq, he left but also destroy Pakistan.
but i am hopeful that present leadership will end this cancer.
India after Mumbai attack said that behind this attack there was a hand of Pakistani extremest.
Pakistan denies that blame, and has said that they will give all possible help to India in interrogation.
India said that it gave a list to Pakistan which shows suspected names of extremist which India required.
now Pakistan said that listed name of Jaish Muhammad Leader Mulana Masood Azhar hide him self and government did not have any information about him.
before this, Pakistani president Asif Ali Zardari denied the claim that western secret agencies and Indian government gave evidence to Pakistan about Mumbai attack.
president Zardari said about Ajmal Qasaab that this was not prove that he is Pakistani.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned Pakistan that its relationship with India cannot improve if it's land is being used for terrorism.
In the latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to Pakistan.
Should these political issues effect sports?
What do you see in the future for Pakistan and India relations.
America will not break and neither will Pakistan or India.
Pakistan will be broken by Pakistanis themselves.
What do you expect after so much provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism.
It has been proven over time that Jinnah has not been good to the Muslims of India.
Yasmin, Chicago.
If Mr. Jinnah's vision was followed, the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism would not have spread to Pakistan and the Muslims in India would not have acted as they had.
It's our fault that we could not bring up a leader of his stature.
if we can not care for our heroes, then
This region has great capabilities.
God knows when we'll understand and the region can progress with the blessing of unity.
In both countries the enemies to peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv sena, and RSS have been raised.
The evil powers don't want this region to progress. Therefore, these countries are controlled like puppets.
Can you imagine what status these regions of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world?
Pakistan is under persecution from God because these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
May Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
Sir, if you open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
Other than that National matter are not looking good as well, circumstances in Sarhad, Balochistan, Karachi in Sindh are in front of you.
In a situation like this, a country needs a leader who can unite all of us into a single nation.
O, Allah, have mercy on us.
In my opinion, there is no other way than a last war.
Too much has happened.
Now, this affair is win or lose.
This problem will not be solved with hypocrisy or deceit.
And neither with small big terrorism in each other countries.
Even Europe came to rest, after fighting the last great war.
If this war had not happened, then they would all be talking like Pakistan and India.
Almost all of our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be finished.
Our military leadership doesn't seem to be sincere in these regards. On the one hand, America and Europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism, and on the other hand we secretly help the Taliban.
We should think and fix our direction and choose only one way. Thanks.
There is no doubt that the majority of the workers of Jama'athud Da'wah are the previous members of Lashkar-e-Taiba who joint the group called Jama'athud Da'wah Pakistan, after Lashkar-e-Taiba was rendered inexistent.
However, after that, the members gave preference to social work, and now even Jama'athud Da'wah was rendered inexistent by the United Nations due to the pressure applied by India and the crackdown being enforced by the Pakistani government.
I believe that if Jihadi groups leave religious fundamentalism and take up social efforts, that would be better.
The present terrorist groups that bring up criminals in the name of Jihad, and the elders of these Mullas, are the same people who used to call 'Pakistan' 'Palidistan', and who knows what else.
Now they aren't leaving any stone unturned when destroying Pakistan.
Actually, these are not even fit to be called human beings, let alone 'Muslims'.
Without cleaning Pakistan of these mischief mongers, the national security will remain at risk.
Can we still think about whether or not to put a ban on these mischief mongers?
There is no place on earth for extremist Mullah's who only work to cause killings.
This news tore my heart.
What kind of world is that in which it has become difficult for those who even take the name of one of the important parts of the religion of Allah, Islam ?
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims, but if a Muslim even tries to extract revenge, along with the whole non-Muslim world, even the hypocrite leaders join and treat those who have sincere religious feeling like our great leaders are treating Hafiz Saeed.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo
Pak relationships turned sour, because of which the proximity between the two countries forming after many years, for the first time suffered a severe setback.
India has always claimed that militant and non-militant groups which are active in Pakistan are responsible.
For the relationships to return to normal, taking action against these countries are made a prerequisite,
Whereas Indian security agencies have accused Lashkar-e-Taiba of being directly responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
The name of Jama'athud Da'wah also comes up many times in this regards.
This is not the first time that relationships between the two countries have become serious due to some terrorist activity that took place in India.
In December 2001, after the attack on the parliament, the two neighbors were prepared to go to war.
After that, Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned and it was included in the list of terrorist groups.
Now, it is being demanded that Jama'athud Da'wah, which according to security reports is just a new form of Lashkar-e-Taiba, also be banned.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against the active fundamentalist groups within its boundaries or not?
Can putting a ban on Jama'athud Da'wah help the present Indo-
Pak crisis to subside, and how important is it for permanent peace between the two countries that armed groups be dismantled?
The Security Council of the United Nations has passed the ban on Jama'athud Da'wah. However, what proof did the Security Council have based on which it showed such urgency?
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complaint and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful state.
Intelligence, army, and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours. India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram, and the Sufis continue to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam will spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salam- Please do it with pleasure but act at your own.
Do not do it under American pressure.
Ff India is aggrieved; it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give evidence?
Why do they accuse us of every thing?
There are extremist groups and organizations in India as well; why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorist group in the world?
What India is doing in Kashmir, what is that?
What Israel is doing, what is that?
The truth is; we are the first Nuclear Muslim State and why this is the main issue.
Pakistan is now in last steps.
Kamran Hasan, Abu Dhabe
You speak for the heart and situations do too.
The new map of Pakistan is shown in American newspapers and the round of punctuation is also a sign of it.
America is gripping more on Pakistan slowly day by day.
In this situation if we did not show union as a nation then there is possible another part as Bangla daish.
To show disatbleness of errorism is less where will be it in Mambae Hotal, Meriat hotal in Islamabad and in Falastin.
Like this terorrists should be pounished where they will where from Pakistan,India,America or Israel.
Now the question is, "Why is the world silent," since a lot of people died by the terrorist attacks in Pakistan.
Was the attack on Mariat hotal not by terorrists?
Then why?
Hats off to Home Adviser, Mr. Rahman Malik! Masha Allah, he has become so brave and courageous!
?
Not only that, according to BBC, the above mentioned Mr. Malik has vehemently disproved this belief that the arrest of terrorists was being done at the 'request of others'.
Brother, Subhanallah!
Whether the ability is there or not, or whether it should be said that it is not needed.
We, i.e. Pakistan, are fighting somebody else's war.
And what about our own interest which we are trying so hard to save?
No one has the right to interfere in any country's affairs.
This does not seem to be the era of new populations.
If people expect justice, or demand that an external united court be established, we should respect democratic institutions.In fact, we should not help any dictator or army man, as there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan, which I think is not accepted by many people who call for unity.
For example, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
In fact, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population, this problem still occurs.
And this causes more opposing feelings.
If they trust America and the United republics, then let them leave the style of new populations, and let them work on those lines, upholding the sovereignty of the state.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
In occupied Kashmir,which is in Pakistan, security forces captured a camp of practically non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India's accusation is that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Minister, Condoleeza Rice, told the leader of Pakistan that there should be immediate action taken against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack.
He said that the extremists who attacked Mumbai used Pakistani earth satellite.
Meanwhile, the saying of Peshawar commanders is that unknown military persons fired another point of United military trucks and in result 50 military trucks destroyed.
It is the second attack on NETO and America.
Meanwhile, Pakistan made the show of distinctive party Lashkar-e-Taiba and before this was tried to make military persons nonmilitary and military weapons were changed with money and certainly no any action without it.
The situations told that in the past period of President Zia Ul Haq, the efforts of Pakistan to end military parties in the result of entrance of Soviet Union in Afghanistan and the resistance by America funding did not succeed.
The question is that what Pakistan wants to do?
Is Pakistan capable for this?
What do you say?

I ask only one question from flag holders of humanity.
If you kill their children and they bring necklace for you, this is impossible.
Saeed, Multan.
And question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies, say any logic, argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men, laborers and poor workers of different occupations, in revenge of American attack?
If the answer is no, then you have instant need of correcting your point of view.
People were armed, at that time it was dangerous that Russia will turn toward Pakistan after Afghanistan, therefore people were armed.
Now when there is danger that America will overrun Pakistan through passage of Afghanistan of which American president had said out in his election campaign then why should we unarm these people?
Only because America or India army don't have to face any civil resistance after defeating Pakistani army?
Yes, if anyone of them is involved in any destructive actions then Pakistan should act against them.
but this is morn, that government against Lashkaray Taiba  that prove right India that Pakistan involve in that.
Najeeb Ul Rehman Saico, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
if accept that Laskaray Taiba involve that still it is wrong to blame Pakistani government.
and one question is also that this terrorist have a either get support of any Government or Indian government personal?
is terrorist only born and made in Pakistan and not made in India and rest of the countries?
as far as Laskaray Taiba has concerned they did not involve to this recent terror.
this has remember that Hafiz Saeed was the first person who called Taliban acts as 'Fitnah'.
this is my firm believe that Taliban acts was a part of American projects so that every that person and group need to clean out from the way who challenge Taliban in any manner.
even support by whole nation, take action against Lashkar due to Indian pressure indicate Zardindco frustration and butter up nature.
American said to end this campagin which start from Saudi's funding ask them godly now clean this dirt as well, which make our society polluted.
We should also protest against them, because in their opinion, America and Saudi Arabia distributed dangerous weapons and announced Jihad but in reality, spread the virus of hateful literature and culture, which caused slaughter houses to open in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, with the announcement that the Pakistani Army will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan and the announcement of the Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly. And tried its' best to get India to attack Pakistan.
This shattered the confidence of America in the area.
Although India did not even threaten nor does it have the guts to.
And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of the Taliban on American posts.
Thus it was proven that without the support of Pakistan and its' army, America can not do anything.
Karachi is Pakistan's business and economic center, and Dubai of the less privileged areas.
Hundreds of thousands do not return empty-handed from here. But since the law was enforced on the western borders, Karachi has taken all the attention.
Now they are looking to kidnap this city.
For the first time Pathan's are called Pashtoons. They are made to fight by making them strangers to each other, although the need is to be united.
One possible solution to the problem is this that either Urdu speaking learn Peshto or Peshto speaking learn Urdu, or what's better is they all learn English.
You will surely think this as a ridiculous suggestion but do you think that the reason for this conflict is not ridiculous?
The reason of violence is language.
Zaheer Chughtai.
Sir I gave this suggestion through childhood to my friends in which there were people according to classification from every religion and dialect but friends used to laugh on me talks.
At that time the condition of Jinna of hatred of dialectal and religious was not that alive and strong but it was brewing internally.
Do not understand what it is and why is it happening?
Are these the very same signs of the Last day?
For what crime are innocent and guiltless being killed?
The reasons are in front of everyone who wants to divide Pakistan in pieces some are active here. The ones who do this neither have religion nor country.
Whether it is in Karachi or Bombay, our homes catch fire from their own lamps. (We  have destroyed our own homes.)
When the government comes in, they just change names of the places to build a name for themselves. Similarly, these days airports, roads, and buildings are all named Benazir.
What has happened in Karachi? Is this what Benazir means?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, there was a failure of efforts of RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi.  This proves that, in the past, political elements that were working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
Unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awakened sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
While the patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties has taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time it has also given American planners one more chance to think.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the turmoil in Karachi, and management is showing self-interest.
Management can control the situation in 1 hour but it is being given extra time on purpose.
Pressure of political parties on police and rangers keeps them from doing the what's  necessary.
Talks of getting united are only limited to statements; political parties should let go of their self-interests and work for the interest of the common man.
As long as there is political pressure on the government, more incidents such as this will take place. May Allah save Pakistan.
I believe these people are the biggest terrorists.
There are definitely some foreign forces at work here, but I do not know who.
And the sad thing is that such a situation was prevalent in any border town. The government would take care of that place, but as this is far from the border, the government looks helpless.
The government should set up an operation here, and save a big and important town from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth due to fear, and as for the local media, it is even thinner.
The truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that either the Urdu speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun speaking people learn Urdu or even better, both learn English.
Definitely, you might think this is a funny proposal, but do you not think the reason for the clashes is funny?
Is the cause of extremism language?
They spilled blood in Karachi, and the story that each citizen was fearing for a long time was finally written.
No one left any stone unturned.  The reports that surfaced in the media only told 50% of what actually happened here in four days.
I have not slept in the last three nights, and I am still afraid.
The people who killed the cobblers and peanut sellers are those who evacuated the hotel.
The people who looted the super highway and cut the ears off of innocent people are all unaware of Allah's punishment, which can catch them anytime.
What do you think the reasons are for this sudden violence?
(BBC)
Keeping the heart rendering Mumbai attacks in view and diving to search for a cause for the violence in Karachi is not at all needed.  Rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in 'blood'.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, \the sun goes out of control.
Liaquat Ali Khan and many Other freedom fighters belong to It. He was writing poetry to remove Mr. Saiko's Misunderstanding.
We will reestablish the old traditions.
We Live for it; and will sacrifice whatever it Takes to protect it.
Faizan Tausif Siddiqui
It's very sad, The whole country is at stake, and we are bickering amongst each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, on Wikipedia.
We got to know that Liaquat Ali Khan was related to the province of Punjab, in the area of Karnal. He also belongs to a Punjabi Family.
for his efforts towards the Refugees, He  is considered as one of their own.
Every action has it's reaction.
you can tolerate till your own but
Ijaz Awan
Sir, before you convince a large number of people with your proposals, I shall tell you that the signs of this mischief are also found on the walls of Karachi, in the form of posters and wall chalking.
We have been seeing both types of mischief.
Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan alone. They did not have to face any reaction.
Quite the opposite, they are pecking at the heart of Pakistan.
There used to be one Muslim League, but they also wrote the rough version of the 18th amendment and handed it over to the Peoples Party.
Before that, MQM and Muslim League had already handed in rough versions of the 18th amendment to the national assembly and senate.
It seems like the copies of the 18th amendment are political trickery, and no one is sincere about accepting that amendment.
This is why no fuss was made in the assembly or on the floor of the senate over this amendment, and the parliament was not forced into accepting the amendment.
It looks as if the parties just wanted to get the thing off their backs by submitting the rough versions, so that tomorrow they may say that they submitted their versions of the amendment but the government speaker did not take action.
MQM coalition partner of government, Muslim League N an underhand ally of government and Muslim league Q the party to approve the seventeenth amendment then how is it possible that these parties can be sincere to approve the disapprove amendment.
It's just like writing your name amongst shaheeds by just putting color on yourself.
The Peoples Party, at any rate, is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment.
How would one think of getting his own hands cut?
As long as Zardari is the president, the seventeenth amendment is not going to be repealed.
This is the opinion of a majority in our survey and so is the truth.
If the seventeenth amendment was to be repealed then Zardari would never have become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Musharaf as along with being the president he is also the chairman of the Peoples Party.
As long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.
In order to cancel the seventeenth amendment, the political parties will first have to dismiss President Zardari from the presidency.
Neither MQM nor the other parties want this.
Most of the elders from our family belonged to the labor community.
In our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor, we used to pray to Allah: Please save us from this hard labor.
To avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what we should do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor.
The editor wrote in reply that we should select certain subjects and become doctors or engineers.
Right from beginning my trend was toward engineering and I had selected technical drawing instead of biology as well.
But at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor.
I studied biology for hardly a month and then when nothing worked out, I took math as an alternate subject.
Fear of labor made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.
I remembered that when I along with my two sons were trying to remove the carpets from our old house.
The little boy had only been working half an hour when he said,"Daddy, this is not what I was born to do!"
If that's true, you should study more like we do, and cut out some of the physical labor.
The son said, ""I am studying and I will get through it also but it is the work that I can not do""
In three hours, we had completed the job and returned home.
The point is, no matter what their reasoning, if a person picks his destiny no one can stop him from achieving it.
God help you if you're lost!
Even on the first anniversary of Benazir's death, no one had a kind word for her.  If you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at all.
After helping them to suppress the Punjab Movement, Benazir helped India stay focused on Kashmir, while at the same time crushing the independence movement of the Sikhs.
Part of their history which has pushed the country back many years, is the tug of war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif.
Even after her exile, Benazir continued to make negative comments about Kashmir and the nuclear program.
Baenazir went against the pact made with Nawaz Shareef in London by making a deal with General Musharaf
During the time of Baenazir's leadership, she gave an open hand policy to her family members to earn money. Due to this, he got to be known as Mr. 10 Percent.
In the time of Baenazir, her brother got murdered and his murderers are still at large.
Besides being a woman, Baebnazir did not fight for the rights of women.
The way Baenazir did politics on her fathers dead body, her followers are doing, in the same way, politics on the dead bodies of her family.
Baenazir got to be a leader twice and in that time, she punished her father's murder and for some, she didn't even file charges against them.
It has been 37 years since the separation of eastern Pakistan, and, sadly, no leader condemns this day nor do they call it a black day.
It should have been that we would celebrate this 16th September as a black day, and take steps so such a sad incident never takes place again.
On this day, we should have send the Bangali's letters of consolation and try to bring them closer to ourselves.
Now we look at the reasons why eastern Pakistan was separated.
He planned to bring back the people of Bihar who were stuck in Bangladesh, and he sent them gifts to keep their spirits up.
We have become so insulated that, when someone dies in our neighborhood, we are not even aware of it.
We do not care for our brothers and sisters, because we have become selfish.
A huge calamity can pass by, but, by the next day, we are lost in our own day-to-day routine of living.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again: the way that East and West Germany became one.
If we sacrifice a little for one another and leave our selfishness behind us, then we can become one again.
Unfortunately, this wish is unlikely to be fulfilled in the near future.
Today, it was announced that the American governor of the state of Illinois was charged with corruption.
An American friend of mine, showing off his knowledge of current events, said, "Look, this is democracy!", in reference to the possible removal and punishment of the Illinois governor by the state congress.
In America, no gigantic figure is above the law.
There is also your country,Pakistan, whose President was elected after corruption charges were dropped.
my sense of humor woke and I said that what's wrong if a governor got arrested in America, in Pakistan, once we arrested the Prime Minister overnight and hanged him and the second time we exiled one. I used my sense of humor, and I said
When did it happen in America?
Pakistan sent the criminal off with honer from the presidency?  When has such a thing ever happened in America?
In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was suspended, and, besides public support, he has yet to be restored. Has that ever happened in America?
Someone with a fake degree was made the Minister of Health in Pakistan. Has that ever happened in America?
After hearing all of this, the American fell down laughing and conceded defeat.
In this picture, president Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded by Americans on all four sides.
It looks that way, from his smile.
He thinks that America supports his government, but he is forgets that a year ago, they were with Pervez Musharaf.
The picture looks like that of a family.
Before that no picture as such has been published in which the President is in the company of 3 American authorities.
Look like that America's work has been increased in Pakistan and one and more Authorities are working on it or they might not believe that person as compared to the first one.
It might be possible that they have planned this also, keeping in mind President Zardari's promise of fulfillment.
Had he been an intelligent politician then he  would be at least not been smiling in this picture and his face would show some signs of embarrassment.
If the principle of democracy applied on this picture than President Zardari is in Minority
In Democracy Majority rules the Nation and who are they picture is showing
The  Swat ares of Pakistan is like heaven on earth and is also known as Switzerland.
Till now, according to the Government Policy, cross talks are  going along together with the use of power.
But the use of power is resulting in increasing the power of Taliban and increasing sympathy for Taliban.It is also not providing any benefits.
what needs to be done is that the government, instead of using brute force, should eliminate the root causes of the issue.
By eliminating these causes Fazlullah and the Taliban will automatically fade.
To a great extent, the Sharia bill proposed by ANP will resolve many of the problems of Swat.
But besides implementation of the Sharia, the government will need to pay more attention to economic issues.
From the earliest steps of General Musharaf, it looked like the nation had rid itself of incompetent politicians. Unfortunately, his lust for power changed his original plans.
All his hopes hung on participation in the "War on Terror." He had begun considering himself immortal.
Those steps which were expected never materialized.
As soon as Bush's era was near its end he started worrying about the end of his rule. In his panic, he made a deal with thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army, but he never had a handle on what was happening in the government.
Either its Bajor or Swat. The army does not control terror, but bombs the "Enemy" publicly. So much loss of life and wealth. If they paint their enemy as mentally sick, then aren't we the "Enemy?"
Things are getting worse in Swat, a war-torn area of NWFP, despite the military operation.
On one hand the writ of GOVT is limited to a resolution of condemnation passed by National assembly while on other hand the influence of Taliban's FM channel is increasing in swat.
The common citizen has no choice but to obey the rule of power.
Security forces in swat have used lethal weapons and claim to have killed many extremists. Despite these causalities, the Taliban's power is rising and they control nearly 80% of Swat.
As a result, GOVT is not accepting its failure and the Taliban is getting stronger.
The poor citizen is the only loser.
Someone in Swat asked, "How are the Talibans?"  The answer is, "They are very good; they are fighting the war against the enemies of God."
A question about the army was answered, "Very good, it is fighting against the enemies of our country."
Who are the enemies of religion and country?  "The poor citizens."
I am greatly astonished, how the Army of Pakistan will fight against Indian Army when it has failed to control a small group of Talibans.
They are unable to track the illegal FM radio channel of Taliban. I think that can easily be tracked.
This FM radio is strongly propagating the agenda of hatred and terror.
After the girls school, they are demolishing the schools for boys.
Curfew is imposed to facilitate the Taliban's movement.
Tonight, during curfew, they have made new bunkers in the nearby areas of Mangora.
The question arises, "how did they reach that area during curfew"?
If the Army can kill Akbar Bugti in a cave, why can't Taliban be targeted?
For God's sake, the Army should take actions to free the helpless people of Swat from the brutal occupation of Taliban. This will improve the image of the Pakistan Army.
He has said that religion is the reason of bloodshed; would you kindly tell me if it would be a peaceful world without any concept of religion?
Does religion divide us on an ethnic, linguistic and regional basis?
No! No way! Sir, religion is what teaches that no one is black or white, punjabi or muhajir. Otherwise, if religion was not present, then half world would have vanished for the war between white and black and the other half fighting over the status and sect.
Actually, religion gives moral teachings to the man. It binds to him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here. He should spend his life according to his rules.
As a Muslim, I have total faith that Islam is complete way of life and a true religion.
While living in London for many years, I used to ask wellness of my family over the telephone every morning, although many did not even call once to find out how we were. Then I realized that they do not even tolerate our phone calls so we stopped calling.
Living here in France for the last two years, I have also felt the same idea.
I do not know why people expect us to call.
Even though a resolution passed about Iraq a few hours ago, Darfar has absolutely no problem in sending peace army.
The Bombay attacks were condemned in no time and banning dubious groups is only a matter of a few hours.
Where death is dancing, we are doing consensus.
Caretakers of international peace, life is finishing here!
Is the wait really going on for it to finish?
So that some oppressed person would not even be able to think about using some mass destruction weapon like ill will to obtain their right?
Even when a father is holding the corpse of his son, an ounce of sorrow does not arise from any part of your heart?
If that is so, you have no right to be called a human -
rather, you are a blemish on the name of humanity.
OK, it was proven that this area was also the home of the Israelis for thousands of years.
Ideally, these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection, but since their strings are being pulled by the western and Arab countries, peace is not possible without their will.
Indeed, now, even Iran wants to fight a proxy war.
Even if Israeli militant action has stopped for a while, it will start again after some incident.
The owner of the BBC is interested in serving America and Israel, and this is why in the name of 'enlightenment' it has come out with a series of Zionist favoring blogs, and is seeding biased and blind propaganda.
What BBC is doing is  just  a formality. Their primary objective is to earn sympathy.
My request to the moderator is that the commentary of applicants should be published to show that BBC still has some respect for facts.
Thanks.
I don't know how this story was enacted but one is sure that dracolla of every age is thirsty for human blood.
There were wars and bloodshed in every era of history.
It is strange that men of the 21st century, which claim to be more civilized, does not however show any concern over open bloodshed.
How does he not feel that what is happening around him is a distorted/worst face of humanity.
The most tragic aspect, is how the current face of a civilized man will present the concept of humanity to next the generations.
Well wisher, Sajjad ul Hasan, Hayderabad dakan.
At the moment in Dera Ghazi khan and in other parts of the country, it is raining.
Enjoy the weather along with this poem related to it.
The rains are present.
If it rains, it is spring.
If it stays, then it is peace.
Sometimes, it comes without a reason.
At times, it spreads over day and night
Sometimes, it is very noisy, and sometimes it is very quiet.
The rains are present.
in a memory, at a night
to a buried ash
Sometimes the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burned itself.
Sometimes each drop seems sorrowful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What it means to them is whether the country lasts or not.
Whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them.
Our media is corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday afternoon something surprising happened.
There are police running all around the city and yet not one of them checks for illegal parking.
Even the traffic cops were not interested in ticketing the illegally parked vehicles.
What happened was that a U.S. Air Force plane became a ship when it was forced to land in the Hudson River.
So far, the only thing known about the "terrorist" was that it belonged to a family of birds called geese.
Yesterday, it was so cold in New York it might have broke some records.
The temperature never goes down this much.
After walking outside for half an hour, I felt pain in my jaw.
Imagine the conditions of those passengers who jumped into the river.
On the bright side, everybody was safe.
The reason for concern is that the company plane sank during the financial crisis.
Seeing all those sights, I reached the New Jersey side from the West Side Highway. There, I found South Bond closed. What should I do?
Coming back, I found myself stuck in heavy traffic.
Thank the Lord! After an hour of trying to make my way through the traffic, there was an opening. I found myself at the 56th Street exit.
I had not come across the exit first, nor the long lines.
Mekki: My Pakistan! Good greetings. Eid Mubarak to you.
Umar: Of course, Faithful!

There was no other option. Otherwise, I would have to go to the farm
to prepare the meat and skin the chicken, too.

We unnecessarily kept thinking of these Taliban of Swat as indelicate, but who were only unhappy over women's education.
They kept expressing their grief by demolishing a women's school and college somewhere every day.
But just like other ideas, this idea also did not come true, according to this report by CNN. Today on the sacred day of Monday this Taliban gang of Swat have blasted a boy's school.
In Swat,the Taliban pulled down the school of students.
The schools of girls were pulled down first in the cause of famous English school Ladies First and I do not that the people why did not consider Talibab free of crimes.
It is also incorrect that the Taliban are only against the public education of girls.
Rather, they are totally against education.
These freedom fighters are gifted with more power than the Devil.
which is commanding us and he is helped to abolish it.
Amen, Amen.
120 schools have been taken down to date.
The tradition of engagement before birth in Muslims,to marriage with Quran in order to control inherits and the insistence of many mufties that the girl became adult and sensible in 8 years it was not minor it is not only but in India a girl was married with a frog.
See the pictures taken at the time of marriage.
Sometime before this, there was a girl married to a dog.
Let's see that groom.
Humanity has ceased to exist in the twenty first century.
This is the time of the computers, and their role in our lives is ever increasing.
A lot of people have reservations on so much dependence on computers in our lives, especially in case of financial or monetary matters.
Where there are certain comforts by the use of credit cards, this allows law enforcement agencies to get to know more about you.
Just looking at a credit card transactions record, your whereabouts can be traced.
In the future, the use of real paper money will get limited because the benefits of credit cards will increase more.
In crime it is preferred to steal credit card information rather than looting a bank.
The computer has provided means for friendships and networking.
Social Networking sites like Orkut, Facebook and Myspace come in first tier when compared according to popularity.
But don't you feel that psychologically, the more we accustome ourselves to social networks, the more we are physically getting away from people.
Match-making websites match your choices to other peoples choices to find similarities. You then get a list of such matches.
Now can you spend your life with a person exactly like you.
I can't. That's why we can't compromise a life partner who is half or partly similar to you.
My faults can be compensated by my partners'.
I guess I got a lesser part of intelligence.
Since childhood, whenever an elder said anything to me that was the truth for me.
This is how I came to the believe that Dad has the answer to every question in the world.
People used to make a lot of jokes about me because of this.
the only thing that look truth is which can be done in real.
The necessity of lying is often frustrating.
Because of this, he suffered as well.
It is always my desire to lie as little as possible.
Don't lie in the name of God.
and say Inshallah only when the prayers is only for the God that he will accomplish it
God knows your true intentions.
this is the Only complicated problem due to the distance from  the religion.
According to our religion, as well as Pakistani law, minors should live with their mothers.
The father should meet their needs.
Then, when the kids get mature, they can live with anyone they want.
You have rightly said about the misunderstandings relatives create.
Our behavior is over taken by feudal thinking.
Ever here this way of thinking is working that new co-sharers will be born in father's property and this is where the opposition is shown. Otherwise their father's this behavior is worth praise and pursuance.
With reference to relationships, this forceful affiliation has created evil in our society.
The concept of marriage of a divorcee or a widow is ending.
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason for family breakups.
In our society, if a wife of a 50-55 year old man or husband of a woman passes away, and he marries again, why is he not respected?
There is a Pakistani uncle living close to us, his wife passed away around 10-12 years ago. Now after all his children got married, he married a widow, for which his kids have turned against him.
In my point of view, it is their religious right. What do you say?
They said: "How could he consider having someone else take the place of our mother?"
I think his sons should ask themselves what he did that was so wrong when he married a widow after his children got married.
In this way, the widow got someone to help and support her and he got someone to take care of his home.
His sons and daughters are involved with their own lives and will not take care of him.
Their thinking is not reasonable.
If the sons' wives refused to serve their father-in-law, what would he do?
The sons are responding to societal pressure.
People mock such a family and such an action, so the sons oppose the second marriage.
In actual fact, what their father did is in accordance with Islamic principles.
It is a curse in our society we are caught in it from 40 to 50 years.
The feeling of a wife is, her husband can do lots of bad things whatever it may be, but he does not have to marry again
if she has the potency she will try even after her death
Along with her husband, she is also losing the life after death, and she is one for the evils things in the environment
Saying Islam, Islam from the mouth does not do any thing, we like the thing which are there in rituals
like, demotivation for the girls education, and love marriage, etc.,
now your question is, if the big brother would rather bring the widow to his home, he might have gone to her home, then there will no quarrels from his children (the quarrel may be in the widows children)
We embraced Islam even before the separation of Hindustan and Pakistan, but we have not came out of such evil thinking and this ritual is more important than Islam
The second marriage of a man is bad. Divorce is known to be bad. The divorced women is a untouchable sin, love marriage is the bad impression, the marriage of a man with a elder woman is said to be the evil plan of the woman. The above things are of such evil thinkings
and we think that if we wont follow modernism, we are considered to be an old thinking man
Embracing Islam is easy, but to come out from such evil thinking is some what impossible.
Allah, bless us with the ability and courage to perform this task.
Amen.
It was never that difficult to write Urdu.
It took centuries to write this small amount.
Think of this less as a lot.
Goodbye.
In his book "I am Taimur", Ameer Taimur writes "I found the secret of my lifetime is that if the commander of any army is present on the front line, than that army will never be defeated."
But here, the things are all together different.
They say the population is by default for getting killed for us.
If anyone dies from the population, it is considered murder.
May peace and blessing of Almighty be upon you.
I was coming back to my shop after the Isha prayer tonight, a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called me.
I thought that probably this man has lost his way or wants to ask something, I stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked me if I could speak and understand Arabic, I said no problem, you tell me what's up?
He started telling that he has come from Riyadh and here in Medina someone picked his pocket, so he needed help. I said please go away brother, since such an incident has already taken place with me that I gave this man 12 riyals so that he could reach Riyadh, but he started doing the same act after moving a little further.
I was furious, I cursed him and threatened him to the Police, then he ran away.
This is the situation of Muslims now that even for begging we ride our cars along with our families and make at least 2 to 3 thousand a day.
However there is a clear Hadith (SAAW) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one.
May Allah bless us and make us true Muslims (Amen)
Wassalam

Do you think that the accusation on Adnan Sami by his wife is correct?
Can this accusation be an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Inform us about your opinion on the Subject.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
As far as allegations are concerned, anyone can post it on someone else.
Nothing comes before prestige.
however may be the relations between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he left his respectful life and went to India to make money and now this fame has caught him badly.
This is a consequence of his own deeds.
Washington...
Top American officials say that president Obama will take a strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
In the new American policy over Afghanistan there is more emphasis on war than development.
Officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in the achievement of American goals Since in his government, there is corruption, drugs business has increased and Taliban are regaining their power.
American officials say that people, who are putting more pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more, include vice president Joe Biden and President Obama's representative for Afhanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke.
He said that the strategy came about after President Bush left. He participated in video conference with Hamid Karzay every fortnight and those conferences emphasized America's role in reconstructing Afghanistan and its cities.
The American officer said that the Central administration under Obama will actually work with local leaders for a change.
The officer said emphasis will be given to the fight against corruption joining hands with the Karzay administration.
Hamid Karzay is going to face a new election and it is still not clear whether Obama and his friends will support Karzay's candidacy for President.
Can we predict whether the declaration by the American Officer will affect a policy change in Afghan affairs?
Or whether Hamid Karzay's rule is coming to an end?
What do you think about all of this?
SriLanka beat Pakistan in the three day international cricket match series by two games to one.
In the first one day match Pakistan defeated SriLanka, but then SriLanka went on to win the remaining two matches.
In the match on the third day the performance of the national team was too awesome. The team chased a total of 309 runs, while SriLanka was only able to score 75 in 23 overs. The national team should have learned a lesson from this defeat.
From the results of the series, it becomes evident that the performance of the national cricket team is not consistent.
Despite home ground and all claims, the national team suffered defeat. What do you think are the reasons?
Which aspects of the game should experts focus on?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
Which part do you place the responsibility of the loss on, fielding, batting or bowling?
Let us know of your opinion.
Malik Babar Husain, Jeddah. It is very sad that even in todays modern age, such ignorant traditions are prevalent. If the landlord or the property owner targets innocent people with his harsh dictatorship, who will call them Muslims?
Let any big shot walk on these burning coals. Why does the government allow them to do that?
When will court justice come into play?
The Sri Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan, to play the one day international series.
The happy news is that the foreign team is still coming to Pakistan regardless of tension between India and Pakistan.
On arrival at Karachi airport, the SriLankan team was given a warm welcome.
Between Pakistan and Srilanka, two matches are held at Karachi and while one is at Lahore.
Both teams are claiming assurance regarding bowling, batting, and fielding.
Srilankan is proud of their Spiner while Pakistani is believing in their fast bowler.
Srilankan Captain Mahela Jaywardena has said that there is no one Player of Pakistan team but Whole Pakistan team is dangerous
Murlidharan and Mendas will be our trump card; on the other side Pakistan' Captain has said that the competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik has said that we have played Murlidharn and will see Mendas as well, and will develop a secret game plan which we will show on the ground.
Will Pak-Sri series be entertaining and thrill?
Whose side will be heavier in Pakistan and Srilanka series?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the most valuable player of the series?
Let us know your opinion.
Gulfam, London, Publish statements that are of liking, you give preference to We would like you to write the truth.  Do not entangle the statement like Mukher Jee, because it is commanded to say truth in front of tyrant and it is equal to Crusade(Jihad).

It is all these people's doing Kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years.
No, no one  asked.  Now, they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism.  So, they have started talking about peace and settlement.
First, they generally massacred Muslims.  Now, they are perplexed, attempting to settle the matter.
In a way, Pakistan has to understand their own duplicitous policies.
Asad Khan, London
India creates situations that make people all over the world focus their attention on Kashmir.
Pakistan always shows the truth of India to the world.
The British government also understands that India created a bad image of Pakistan's terrorism so that people would focus on Kashmir occupation.
and frustrated to talk about this matter with Pakistan
British Foreign minister David Milliband said that by resolving the Kashmir issue terrorism will stop and the government of Pakistan can improve the way they handle new challenges on their border.
The President of the United States Barack Obama expressed a similar opinion.
British foreign minster has said that even though the fight against terrorism is dangerous, for their own safety they chose to fight.
David Milliband said that Pakistan did not show sympathy for terrorist groups.
Due to pressure from big powers to resolve conflict of Kashmir, India tries to direct focus to this region to turn back concentration from the problem.
Perhaps Mumbai terrorism is a part of this conspiracy?
Does India want to use terrorism as a means to avoid dialogue?
Let us know about your opinion.
Usman Afzaal
I think the big powers (countries) are who want to harm Pakistan.
They in fact are thinking of ways to control Pakistan because they know Pakistan is an atomic power.
They want to create an environment of revolution.
Foreign countries are thinking that if Pakistan is cornered that will pose more political and geographical problems. They want to help Pakistan so they can achieve their vested interests.
A citizen of the USA.
There's a Hindu saying that goes 'walking stick in arm and name of Ram (Hindu God) on lips'.
I think from time to time there is anxiety and to relieve that Pakistan is blamed for, or at least associated with, some negative event.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian army chief should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.
Faheem Siddiqi
This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but we know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is in hot water.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The prime minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani, said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden, played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing him with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the Parliament.
The prime minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers' movement not played any role?

The Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has once again accused Pakistan of provoking a war.
And Pakistan is using terrorism as state policy.
While addressing a Prime Minister's conference in New Delhi, Manmohan Singh said that the terrorist elements are backed by neighboring countries, especially Pakistan.
The terrorists behind the Mumbai attacks used the pelagic route and were safe from the Indian Coast Guard.
The Indian Prime Minister said that the November attacks were carried out by Lashkare Taiba.
He added that the terrorists are using modern techniques and the latest communication systems. "We'll have to be more rigorous in controlling the border where they are infiltrating," he said, adding that terrorism will not be tolerated in any case and that that is their policy.
What do you think of this allegation from the Indian Prime Minister?
Does the internal Political strife and individualism show that India is in trouble?
On what basis has India warned others?

This is the most dangerous situation where Isreal kills Palestinians, on the other hand it is also the same in Kashmir; it went unnoticed by any peace councils, and not even responding to this.
The Associations in Kashmir and Palestian have to fight for their freedom, and they must unite and struggle with dangerous situations. One day their struggle will result in good. Insha Allah
In Ghaza, the Israeli air force attacks Palestine and many people have died.
The important Political Person of HAMAS Nazariyan has killed along with his family.
On the other side the functions of the peace councils were closed, without any conclusion.
The conference was conducted against Isreal by Libya and other gulf countries, and the report was submitted to America.
Over the last few days, there have been bombings by Israeli planes on the Palestinian civilian population.
The whole world cried out regarding the Mumbai issue, but the Israeli attacks do not seem a massacre to anyone including America and Britain.
Why are the important Islamic countries quiet?
What do you want to say about this double standard of the world?

I think that actually, most of our people are illiterate. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties. The electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has taken a serious position.
On the other side, there was an increase of an average of 18% in gas rates, while the unavailability of petrol in some cities has become a cause of great difficulty for the public.
Among the manufacturing and business circles, there are strong protests and severe reactions going on to the long-term power cuts and gas crisis.
Industrialists give an ultimatum before closing the factories.
Here there is growing anxiety among those dwelling in  Karachi because of eight to ten hours electricity load shedding.
Industrial activities have almost stopped completely.
Government departments are playing a blame game on each other.
Under these circumstances the proposals for increasing electricity and gas tariffs is a joke with the people.
Why is attention not being focused on resolving the issues?
Can the government see the failing of the country's economy?
To solve these problems in the short term, what suggestions do you have?
Please give us your opinion.
Imran Khokar from Madina Munawara Saudi Arabia: I want to say that with the way people are, they get similar leaders.
I am surprised that a government who claims to support public services is actually hurting them.
The unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a persecution.
The government has no control over these institutions.
Law and order is deteriorating every day; may Allah bestow His mercy on this country.
A new year has started.
Last year was a year of outbreaks and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered for terrorism.
It also marks the stepping down of President Musharf and the end of Presdient Bush's eight years in office, the throwing of shoes on Bush and formation of democratic government in Pakistan, calamities and an earthquake in Baluchistan, and a global financial slump.
A new year is arriving.  What do you foresee in the new year?
In your opinion, what will be the result of the political or geographical situation? What will be Obama's strategy?
Is there hope for progress towards eliminating terrorism.
Is the judicial crisis of Pakistan over soon?
What will become of the relationship between Pakistan and India?
Is there a chance of surgical strike or full scale war?
What expectations do you have for the new year?

The first anniversary of Benazir Bhutto is being celebrated. She was murdered in an election rally at Liaquat Garden Rawalpindi, on December 27, 2007.
Today Benazir is not within us. She was a seasoned politician and a personality of international repute. She had a unique status in the country's politics.
The mystery of her murder has yet today, still not been solved.
Her efforts to establish government and democracy in the country was not wasted.
Today, a democratic government has been established in Pakistan, and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari is holding the office of the President of the State.
How do you see Shaheed Benazir's role in Pakistani politics?
Who can be behind her martyrdom?
She was recently awarded the global award for human rights. What would you like to say about her political and democratic services?
After presiding over America for eight years, President Bush has left the White House and moved to Camp David so the White House can be renovated to Barack Obama's tastes.
The destruction of the World Trade Center, attack on the Pentagon, and Bush's subsequent "war on terror" retaliation against Afghanistan and Iraq (with the assistance of forces from other countries) have become memorable examples of his presidency.
Due to this war, America faced the worst ever economic and financial crisis in its history.
What do you think the world achieved and lost as a result of this war?
Were the policies of Bush successful?
What is your opinion of Bush's presidency?
The Indian government has stopped its cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one-day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, when interviewed by Jeev News, said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour.  Due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip due to the present political situation a proper step? Shouldn't sports be separate from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that the security conditions are so bad in India, the England cricket team is continuing its tour. So why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this matter?

Their are people who are proud about going to India.
They make their films and videos over there. Their eyes should now be open to how much the people of India respect them.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami should return to Pakistan first chance he gets because respect did not suit you there either.

India's attitude has changed since the attacks in Mumbai.
Jagjit Singh has shown by his reaction that he hates Pakistan and the Pakistanis.
Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsley. Why should he be considered a bad singer now? Adnan Sami should stay in India, though, since there is no need for him to come to Pakistan.
Muhammad Shamshaad Alam,Karachi
As to the statement of Jagjit Singh, I can only say that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements there that relate to the actual circumstances? Pakistanis, open your eyes to how much value you are accorded in India. Understand the Indian mentality.
After the Mumbai incident, angry statements have increased there. Now people are saying bad things about the famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to foreign news agencies, in the farewell trip of American President George Bush during a press conference with the Prime Minister Nur-al-Maliki, the situation became hilarious when an Iraqi journalist in the Prime Minister's office told Bush, "Dog, this is a farewell kiss".
The journalist then took his shoe off and threw it at Bush. President Bush ducked with expertise and saved himself from getting hit by the shoe.
The second shoe hit the American flag.
Security agents pulled this journalist away from there.
On this occasion, President Bush said that he did not know why he did that.  The shoe was size ten, he was not bothered.
In your opinion, does this action of the journalist show the anger of the Iraqi public against President Bush?
What do you say about this incident?
After the terror incidents in Mumbai, the tension in Indo-Pak relations escalated to a grave extent when Indian Air Force war planes violated Pakistani air space in the Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
Due to the reaction of the Pakistani Air Force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
According to sources, both Indian planes were full of weapons and ammunition.
This is the first incident if it's kind in the current tense situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that they are all set for the country's air defense.
Information Minister, Sherry Rahman, says that Indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed. Although, this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
In your opinion, does India really have an intention of air strike on Pakistan?
Is this statement of India correct?  That this violation was a mistake, or this was to find out the ability of Pakistan's Air force.
Is this incident going to aggravate the current estrangement among the two countries?

Respected martyr, Benazir Bhutto, was given the International Award for Human Rights after her death, which was received by her son and chairperson of the People's Party, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
During a session of General Assembly in the United Nations headquarters, former prime minister of Pakistan, martyr Benazir Bhutto, was presented with this award for acknowledgment of her efforts for human rights in a ceremony.
On the December 10th the United Nations celebrated the 60th anniversary of the passage of the human rights resolution.
Benazir Bhutto, former American Attorney General Louis Ramsey Clark, and the worldwide Human Rights Watch were among the people and institutes being recognized with honors for their work in human rights on the occasion.
Present for the occasion were Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Abdullah Hussain Haroon and other senior embassy agents.
What do you think about the martyred former Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, receiving this award?
Samir

It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, and how proud she was of Naseerullah Babar's success.
However, she completely changed later.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party, and made her son the representative of Peoples Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi. This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
As long as the iron ax is fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are are adopting secretive ways and this is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations have included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed (as well as two other Pakistani citizens) and that of Jama'athud Da'wah (as well as four other organizations) into the list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaidah and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, the practically non-existent organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba Operation Chief, Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, there was a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek, also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organizations listed were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organizations, restrict their trave. and arrest them.
They will have to face charges.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India accusing these organizations of being responsible for the Mumbai Attacks when they do not have any proof?
Why doesn't India have any local terrorist groups?
Are these world organizations aware of the persecution of minorities in India?
