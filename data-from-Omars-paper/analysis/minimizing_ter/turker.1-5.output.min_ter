'first nuclear experiment was done in 1990'
Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.
this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.
Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News, that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Thomas Reid said that based to many reasons, he has a belief that China had experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
the reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.
he further added that this was the reason that in 1998 only in a span of two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments as a reply to Indian nuclear experiments.
Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiment.
He added that the atom bomb that was tested on May 19th 1998 by Pakistan was made very carefully and that Pakistani scientists had complete reliance on it.
When Thomas Reid was asked whether China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said because India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.
He said that there was proof available that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and later on the documents which were received from Libya also verify this fact.
Upon another question, as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.
He said that we also predict that Israel also has access to the results of this experiment.
Thomas Reid was also asked about China's nuclear distribution program which is going on.
Upon that Thomas Reid said that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Asfahan, Iran since 1991.
Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.
He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libia and Yemen thorough North Korea.

According to the official sources, police and army surrounded the area and started the search on receiving secret information.

The role of European Union for the peace in Middle East
from official point of view, the role of European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of Sarkozy are helping hands in this process.
The spokesperson of the European Commission, Amadeu Altafaj, said that every effort which helps advancing the joint message of the European Union to the two parties, is welcome.
As far as the state policy is concerned, everyone seems alright.
However, in reality, the European Union is in a sad state of internal differences from the inside.
The role of Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak
On top of that, internal fighting has made it all the more helpless.
on the other hand the French president Sarkozy is behaving like if he is still the president of the European Union.
Whereas France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a presidential role, and he is able to, but he does not have the permission to do so.
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner is facing the funniest side.
He is in the delegation which is led by Schwarzenberg, the Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic. 
In addition, the two foreign ministers are giving different statements on the war in Middle East. 
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend herself, while according to Kouchner war is not the answer.  Germany has also sent a special ambassador to the Middle East. As long as European Union does not show a unanimous stand, she can not be successful on the diplomatic front. 
Its evidence is the reaction of Israel who does not pay an importance to the conciliation efforts of the EU.
this is a golden chance for the European Union to do something since America due to the policies of George W. Bush has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial crisis: German millionaire industrialist's suicide
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany left a huge business group behind him.
But earlier common German citizens did not know much about him.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.
then the financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed 100 Million and 1 billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on Marclay.
Some time back the bank agreed to provide Merkel Group an emergency loan but Adolf Merkel who raised from a small industrialist to the position of a strong industrial group whose annual income was approximately 30 billion Euro, could not bare the loss in his investment capability.
After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quick, putting it on new lines.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm, Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm always had special importance.
Adolf Marclay has said this many times in his life. ""We have been in pharma business since four generations"".
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have sanctioned 400 million Euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.
Like this, after the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain the same as it was.
Crime rate of foreigners living in Germany
According to recent statistics the crime rate of foreigners between 2004 to 2007 .22
dropped from 22.9%
4 percent.
According to Joachim Herrmann, the interior minister of Baweria province, this is apparently a positive change.
He said: "It is important to note that the number of foreigners getting German citizenship is increasing.
Therefore this should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German but his background is foreign.
Herrmann said that from 2010 his state will keep this fact in mind while collecting the data of criminals.
Besides Baweria, Hamburg is also thinking in the same lines.
Senator Christoph Ahlhaus of Interior ministry from CDU said:"" When the scientific research is conducted one can not draw results of his own rather they depend on the data which is calculated after research.
Ahlhaus diverted the attention to a research report from the anti crime's provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamberg, it was investigated that out of all crimes happening there what percentage have the involvement of foreigners.
Results indicate that here foreigners
had a lower crime percentage than the crimes taking place in the whole state.
Contrary to this, during 2006, when the percentage of youngsters committing crimes was calculated, it became evident that the youngsters from a foreign background committing crime was 44
.7 percent.
However, other political parties of Germany for example, SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei were against this proposal that while collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired that which German citizen has a foreign background.

May Allah bless the tongues of the world and may Barack become a blessing for the world.
Though there is not much hope, but we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan , effected by this change, are in our favor.
And what Barack Obama, who is the result of Martin Luther Kings dreams, gives to the world.
Obama, part of whose name is Husain, taking the oath today, as the American President, is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance, but also a historic test.
Not only for himself, but also for all the people who supported him.
This will also be a test for the white majority, as it is not easy for them to accept wholeheartedly the presidency of a black man. 
Those here in South Asia, especially the Muslims, who have hopes about him, should remember that he was elected the president of America, and Obama should remember that the president of America is actually the president of the world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
It is necessary for people who likes him not to have over expectations from him.
if Obama becomes successful in decreasing the religious and racial acrimony, it will be a victory for his fans.
What effect will this change have on South Asia, and what considerable change can be expected in the American policy in this regards?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan.
BBC
My Sir, whether it be Obama or someone else, the type of policies with regards to the whole world is decided by the multi-billionaire, influential, strong Jewish lobby.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts,the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is in front of everyone.
After the formation of Pakistan, the South was under Wali South, which had a single rule. 
With a help of an agreement they transferred the administration of Swat to the Pakistan government.
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a step mother.
In the south, after the end of Wali South rule, no more schools were built. 
Nor was there any interest in the construction and development over there.
Presently the girls seeking education went down.
The Taliban are continuing their attacks on educational institutions in the NWFP.
Swat has suffered the highest number of schools destroyed and the majority of them have been girl schools.
Not only this, but the Taliban have announced the prohibition of girls education in Swat.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.
what do you think, by stopping girls' education, what the Taliban want to achieve?
Why has the government been unsuccessful in stopping these illegal steps?
what do you think the government should do.
The question should be, what does the ISI and Pakistani agencies get?
Because the public of Swat have realized this was a game, and that the army was there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them. Otherwise, how could five schools be blown up in a single curfew night? How could people be slaughtered during curfew and hung in the main circle of the town?
When the government is not being allowed to have any say in Swat, how can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps?
Now, the question arises, as to when the government has an armed military, new and dangerous weapons, new technology and spy system etc., then why are these four Taliban not being controlled?
The only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught.
The conclusion is that the Taliban, through there dark activities is making the work of the global leadership easier.
15 years ago, the war was on in Afghanistan.
ISI had control over the Taliban, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran. 
Then, suddenly the situation changed and Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of Dollars from America, so the previous friend became an enemy.
Now the scenario is that the war is still raging but the supporters in Pakistan are still the same, Iran, India and Russia.
It is a human mistake of doing wrong by not doing what is right.
If a thief robs a place, then he is in danger to rob the same place and same time tomorrow as well. If he fears god and man, he will not steal.
Similarly,  Israel should realised that it is a wrong thing to have bloodshed in Gaza.
Greetings!
Question is that is war, armed movement, terrorism is solution to problems?
If not then what is that unique formula that can move us toward solving this issue?
This extremist path of war does not solve our problems  but increases them.
Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq should adopt these models in order to get Independence which Nelson Mandela uses in South Africa
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
kashmiri's participation in election shows that they have accepted this point.
Israeli attacks are going on Gaza from 3 weeks and death toll has reached to 1000.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date, a ceasefire was not possible.
And according to a guess 9000 Falatinis have been left their homes and gone to save places after the attacks  starting in December.
And here helpful institutions blamed Israel that he did not care the Falastini children and there will be one total posterity in hard mental and emotional problems.
What do you say?
what should suppose to be done ?
How is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Taliban should be given a chance
Basit, Peshawar
Wake up! If Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down girls schools?
And kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
These Taliban has damaged Islam so much that no other nation or religion has done.
Pushtun force
Kohat, Pakistan
If the entire Muslim world gets together and even just warns Israel of attacking it, you will see how much Israel's daddy, America will get hurt.
and immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well.
But what can be done, where can our leaders get so much courage from?
someone tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step as he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights does not rest with the Arabs or the Muslims of the world alone but is the obligation of the entire world community to raise their voice against tyranny.
This dreadful incident is the worst amongst the crimes committed by Bush.
Similar to how, in Pakistan and India, on the 30th of June, that is before the close of the financial year, the government institutions are looted, in the same way, before the winding up of the American government, Israel was given the green signal to do whatever it wants.
on one hand America says that effort will be made for ceasefire.
On the other side, the United Nation is passing one resolution over another but both have done nothing practically, this means that united nation is also working  to crush the Muslims.
All Muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the United Nations, and should establish their own global organisation.
We have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations are seen, but the harm is only done to the Muslims.
What is the use of this probaganda when BBC is not going to publish it.
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically of Muslims, is spilled, the monster of unbiasedness gets onto BBC's back.
by the way is a flag bearer of rights
Saying something from their side is a far away thing, they do not want even comments
from the Muslims.
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, and the likes of you stay among Muslims, call yourselves Muslims and cause Muslims..
[syja786]
For a while, BBC forums have been making a certain point, sometimes while discussing suicide attacks and other times, terrorism in India.
Extremism is the favorite word for those anti-islamic comments.
But, who is extremist, that you can easily figure out from the above comment.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal can not be fought with the sword?
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what shall one do other than crying?
But the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that we try to use the name of Jihad to disfigure the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existece of Israel, then what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks.
The conduct of both sides is misanthropist.
The role of UN and the USA was again seen as favoring towards the injustice of Israel.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
And we should think about giving the real terrorists an anti-terrorism Nobel prize for their painstaking efforts against terrorism, as after all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, would it be possible for terrorism to take place at such a large scale without the support of some big leader? And everyone knows who is controlling the strings.
In easy words, such gangsters are told to do whatever they want.
Hitting people hard and leave them to cry.
The Arab rulers are giving medicines for the injured,Funeral clothing's for the dead and money and they are asking
Israeli attacks, what should happen?
this is the actual problem that the leaders of Muslim countries including Saudi crownprince are in a false sleep, neither they have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
They should immediately take practical steps against the Israel
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Greetings to all brothers and sisters!
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is similar to considering them defeated.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature, as the steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Hamas and Israel should reconcile so that this bloodshed comes to an end.
Muhammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France.
Absolutely true.
Supposing that Hamas is 100% on the truth, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah. Even then, they should know that if a good deed is resulting in the destruction of an established house, it is no more a good deed.
Those who claim to love God, love the messenger and love their religion, loving mankind is a part of their faith.
As if it is the order of Allah to evacuate all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than the Muslims.
Najeeb-ur-Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI$T@N]
No, not to kill them, but rather the order is to invite them to Islam.
but Jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion.
One should fight with them until they finish their conspiracies. But this certainly does not mean that they can wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the fate of the murderer of innocent children is annihilation.
but I ask my friends that the Israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past have become so strong today that they don't listen to any one, this is because the Jews are united.
there are no Shea's and Sunnis, there are all just Jews and they have developed everything in every field.
in contrast, what is the condition of 55 Islamic countries?
They are behind in every field, and now the situation is that they have become so helpless that the enemy is killing them and they are waiting to die.
it is essential that all Muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
and there is no better strategy, that recognize Israel, learn modern education and means of progress and let the world live in peace and harmony.
Muslims have plenty of land and resources.
There is need to be used properly.
this first most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque and this was impossible without removing Yasin and Arafat from the way.
the world is witnessing that how Palestine had been scattering  after the death of these two leaders.
and how the Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
In 1974 a Pakistani Prime Minister was of such an International trust that first time in history he united all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance.
today on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task that the whole nation promise to not only keep unity in its lines
By eliminating the differences among  Muslims, it will complete its mission of establishing an Islamic Commonwealth. 
This is the Jin which has grabbed the Palestine by half a century.
this jinn have many face.
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
and this jinn other face eating peoples in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
and this jinn have a big fear of Islam, as this jinn knows that when ever he pull out this only and only by Islam Muslims and Muslims complete religion and act of Islam pull out because history said that Islam put on right track many biggest Abujahal.
Israel has been bombarding Gaza with air attacks and missiles since the 27th of December. 
in this attack more than three hundred resident died.
Since the air attacks, Israeli tanks and other land-invading military vehicles have reached the border of Gaza. 
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
although Israel official said that it will continue its action in Gaza until he believe that rockets attack end on Israel.
In your opinion is this right for Israel to say about this inspection is to protect Israel?
is international world do its part in this scenario?
Is this situations due to uprising situations in Israel?
can any improvement be expected in the situation in Middle East after the succession of the newly elected American president Barak Obama.

Palestine will forever remain a sacred place for Muslims and its protection is a must for us.
We should also remember that it was our first Qiblah.
Israel and India have to vanish one day since these countries are made to be broken and God will surely torment these disbelievers. Sajid Sadiq, Lahore.
"When has the night of loneliness been spent shedding tears,
When has a calamity been averted only by supplication" (Nawab Zadah Nasrullah Khan)
BBC searches for such comments and publishes them.
After all, the image and prestige of neutralism has to be kept. 
although the news from BBC are usually correct but the real thing is the style of the news.
Which news to be made prominent and which news to be considered as insignificant.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
in this art now a days the Pakistani electronic and print media, specially some Urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone, who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the "grudge of Muavia" written on them.
has said that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. how long this hypocrisy will continue.
Why there is so much atrocity on Muslims. If people like America leave backing up of Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So if Americans you have courage then leave backing up of them and see then their fate of life.
The famous just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If killing a particular race off completely is the answer, then Hitler's plan would not have seen any Jews survive, and definitely not seen them rise again. 
In the words of a poet
Injustice is injustice. If it breeds, it dies.
Blood is blood. If it bleeds, it dries.
Now who will tell whom what is terrorism?
Is all this not included in terrorism? Why does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocent not red?
And now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere?
I watched the progress of the Mumbai incident, as if my own house was on fire. The sorrow of humans can not be watched, and who can not see this sorrow? If only Muslims would think a bit, together.
Dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood, how shall we condemn, I can not find words!
I feel like crying about the helplessness of Muslims, that on one side, people are dying in India, and the whole world is climbing onto Pakistan, without any proof and saying, take action or else we will.
And on the other side, Israel is ruthlessly killing Muslims and the whole world is silent. This is unbearable.
God has light not darkness and when this darkness ends then.
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
As far as elections are concerned, it is not surprising that the people who are in power do such things to win the heart and mind of people especially in a state like Israel. And speaking of Barak Obama, history shows that no American president has wavered from the policy and will not do so in future. A tyrant is a tyrant whether he is white or black.
It appears from the conversation of the forum that everyone is grieved over Benazir's death, but as a politician her mistakes are not forgotten. 
It is debatable that Benazir died for democracy or for power.
If democracy was dearer, why did she leave the republic for ten years in the control of Musharraf, waiting for American clearance and deal?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when people affected by dictatorship needed her. Unfortunately she came to Pakistan when she assured about government and that she will be freed from trails.
There is no one remaining to say about the criticism and accusations of a historical personality.
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them.

Sir/Madam, maybe if you read not only the history of Pakistan, but of its neighboring four countries or of seven other countries, then you might understand the meaning of Mr. Psycho. 
Tariq Ayaz
One whose nature is wrong cannot be taught.
The reflection of the pine in water never got to be green.
Britain never let them become one, and invented the hindu-muslim friction which was taken ahead by Sir Syed. 
Psycho
How merciless is our nation. We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.
We have progressed enough.
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar if you en wreathe him with books.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks but Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.
If the talk is about war, then there will be many loss of human lives.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu but on the other hand when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader; point to be noted.
First of all, merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and  all christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
We do not want the flames of war, we want the flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
What problems can war solve?
It will give fire and blood today.
Tomorrow will give hunger and necessity.
Therefore, O intelligent people,
it is better that war keeps postponing.
In your and our garden
its better that the glim keeps lightened
the India-America relations have deepened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
This is that old history of America.
Because in the case of an Indian attack, America's goals will also be fulfilled and the expenses will be India's.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation and ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
This is Islamic history.
even before this resolution the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
In compensation for the Mumbai attacks, the abnormal diplomatic and military benefits that India tried to gain, made it more a victimizing party, than a victim. That is why, in contrast to the harsh initial global reactions, the world has now reduced their force on Pakistan.
while ignoring India's unnecessary bobbery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a "Side Effect" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
There is no two opinions about this being a very beastly action.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past one year?
How many Taliban are killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday?
I appeal to the I.S.I that for God's sake, stop monitoring the Taliban and let us live in peace in our heavenly hometown Sawat.
And stop this phony operation.
The day is not far, when a resolution will be passed in the United Nations, against army intervention in Pakistan, in the same way as it was passed against Jama'athud-Da'wah.
Riyaz Ahmed Farooqui
First our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in UN,
And supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
As the bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are immortal even after they die.
But there is an international game being played over here. Here, they are ruling by scaring the public about beastliness and terror.
So that license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will clutch the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
The supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of America, but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions, give it the name of tribal traditions, and clearly avoid it.
Any person with a heart can never accept these beastly actions, which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of Islam.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so brave that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also men of God and so is our army.
It is very clear that there is fishy.
instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and lesson gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
You frightened the world form fire of Hell.
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It is surprising when it is said that this can not be a work of a Muslim
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Upon the death of the Prophet, upon refusing to pledge alliegance, who burnt the door of the daughter of the Messenger and pulled her husband out with a rope around his neck?
Had they come from somewhere outside?
was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
Without accepting the facts, neither motives can be removed nor these can be corrected?
BBC people, stop this dual policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Chowdary, Japan
please show some modesty, a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office.
For the success of Operation Sherdil and across the border the success of Operation Lion Heart depends on the favor of people.
This step is of American and Pakistani intelligence agencies and Pir Sahib is the victim of this conspiracy
all discussions on this forum will now be anti Taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined Taliban and they are doing what can change the public opinion.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public. They even report something like this 'Bombing on Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000, in Swat went there to do.
That the bodies of the Taliban who helps the army is left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake stop this drama.
These Talibans have destroyed the image of muslims.
Through out the world if Muslims don't tell them Muslims then why would terrorists are found in their territories.
those who become insensitive and people who don't want to work hard take guns and join these groups
Islam has not came under the pressure of gun or sword
Have shame.
Its baseless and has no roots in any religion nor in family customs.
All media including BBC show different views on Taliban and Tribals.
But nobody knows what the actual situation is. It is we who know about it because we are tribals.
In short, its a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a talib or a tribal. Who made these institutions? Warmongers who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions.
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that current leadership will end this  cancer.
After Mumbai attacks India said that some extremists are behind the attacks.
Pakistan has denied charges and said that India in the investigation will provide all possible help. 
India said that it has given a list to Pakistan that has 20 suspected extremists required by India.
Pakistan said that leader of Jaish e Muhammad, Maulana Masud Azhar, included in this list has not been detained and the Pakistani government has no information about him. 
Previously, the President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari had rejected the idea that western intelligence agencies and the Indian government had provided Pakistan proof about the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said about Ajmal Qasab that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned Pakistan that its relation with India can not improve unless its land is being used for terrorism.
And in the latest developments, the Indian cricket team cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should these political events affect sports.
How do you see the future developments of the relationship between Pakistan and India? 
Neither America nor India will break Pakistan.
Pakistan will be broken by Pakistanis themselves.
what do you expect after so much provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism.
Time has proved that Jinnah did not do good to the Indian Muslims.
Yasmin, Chicago.
Madam, if Mr. Jinnah's vision was followed, neither the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism had spread in Pakistan nor the Muslims in India had undergone such behavior.
But it is our fault that we couldnt reproduce a leader of similar stature.
If we can't respect our leaders then
This sector does have a lot of abilities.
god knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
In both countries the Mullahs, Pundits, Taliban, Shiv Sena and the RSS etc have been established to oppose the peace process.
And these negative forces do not want the sector to make any progress, hence the countries are kept on their toes.
can you imagine what status will this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world.
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
May God keep our country Pakistan safe, amen. 
But,please open your eyes to look at  the situation and ground realities around you then  you will come to know that where American  troops have reached .
Besides the country matters do not seems better.The circumstances in NWFP, Baluchistan,and the situation of Karachi in Sindh, are also in front of you .
In this situation the country needs that leader who can make us a united nation.
O Allah bestow your mercy upon us.
In my opinion there is no way other than a last war.
Enough is enough.
It's now or never.
These false acts of cooperation will not solve the problem.
And neither with small big terrorism in each other countries.
after all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
and if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be finished.
But our military leadership does not seem sincere in this regard. On one hand they assure America and Europe that they are with them in this war against terror and on the other hand are covertly aiding the Taliban.
We should think and fix our direction and choose only one way. Thanks.
There is no doubt that the majority of the movement league are from the Tayaba Group, who joined the league after the inception of Pakistan.
Although these members preferred subsidiary activities and now after India's great persistence, The United Nation has invalidated it also and Government of Pakistan is continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it is better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
Terrorist groups present in Pakistan, who support professional criminals and the heads of those Mullahs are those who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.
They are not letting any stone unturned in the way to destruction of Pakistan. 
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called Human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan from these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous or not?
There is no place in this world for extremist mullahs whose only purpose is to kill.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What type of world is this in which  it is very difficult to follow and live with the preachings of Allah's islam .
Non muslim can kill muslim but when the muslim try to take revenge then all non muslim  with the whole world brother's  together think ,that the islamic preaching's are done with Hafiz Sayeed.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-
Pakistan relations are affected, and the recent improvement of relations between two countries is enormously shocked.
India has always claimed that militant and non-militant groups which are active in Pakistan were responsible.
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the action against these groups.
The Indian security centres  has blamed the attack on Mumbai the Lashkar-e-tayab is responsible.
Jamat Adawa has also been nominated. 
It is not the first time that because of any terrorist attack the relation of these two countries are worsen.
In December 2001, after the attack on the parliament, the two neighbors were prepared to go to war.
After that, in 2002 Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
Now Jamat Adawa, to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of Lashka-e-Taiba, is demanded to be banned. 
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan do decisive operations against extreme activists on its land?
Can putting a ban on Jama'athud Da'wah help the present Indo-
Pak crisis could resolve and for real peace in between two countries how important is that to finished groups who have weapons?
Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly?
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency against the Muslims?
To say that the plaintiff slow are witness mercurial!
India, itself has become a failed government!
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To the dear nation of one nonpolitical, religious, farming organization...
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when this beautiful Religion rose to the hands of distillation then within the human beings began the difference of religious and disbeliever and the new gateways of pride and prejudice began to open by which the world was unknown before.
Salute, sir, salute happily, but get your work done on your own.
Don't do it under the pressure of America.
if India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
And why do they accuse us with everything?
There are fundamentalist groups and organisations, even in India. Why does no one put any restrictions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the world?
What is it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What is it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the first Islamic Nuclear State. Why, is what the fight is about.
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamranhassan, ABU DHABI
Your words touch the heart, and the situation seems so.
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be the part of this conspiracy.
The Americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over Pakistan.
In this situation, if we do not stand together and show our unity, then remember, if Bangladesh can be made, then anything can happen.
Terrorists' attack should be condemned, whether these are committed in Mumbai, Islamabad or in Philistine.
Like this terorrists should be pounished where they will where from Pakistan,India,America or Israel.
Now the question is that why the whole world including the Pakistani officials are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack on Mariat hotal not by terorrists?
Then why?
Praise the worthy Advisor interior,Mister Rehman Malik,by the grace of God, how brave he has become!
According to BBC on one hand (a committee of) Security Council of UN has banned Jamat Aldawa, on the other hand Mr. Malik says we didn't impose the ban and if it is to be done will be after through research.
not only this, but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under 'someones's pressure'.
Brother, Subhanallah!
Having this capability or not, this I don't want to say.
We, i.e. Pakistan, are fighting somebody else's war
And also its our policies we try to save them.
No one has the right to interfere in any country's affairs.
We cant notice the reign of good.
If people has right view of justice or strengthens on independence respect southern institutions and not help any captain or soldier they there will be definitely peace in Pakistan which is not liked by politicians.
As such, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
This enhances the opposite or anti sentiments.
If America and its Allies believe in Democracy, they should give up their colonial behavior and leave this region
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
Pakistani forces occupying Kashmir raided one of the camps of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba.
Pressure is being increased on Pakistan for taking rapid action against extremist organizations after Mumbai attacks.
India blames that Lashar-i-tayba has role in Mumbai Attacks.

He said that the extremists whom attacked Mambae used Pakistani earth.
Meanwhile, the saying of Pashawar commanders is that  unknown miltary persons fired the another point of United miltary truks and in result 50 miltary truks destroyed.
This is the second attack in Peshawar on NATO and American supplies in the last 48 hours.
Attempts made prior to the raid to disarm the  groups of Laskkr e Taiba from Karachi to the Tribal areas were unsuccessful despite offers of rewards for surrendering weapons and promises of immunity. 
It is clear from the circumstances that efforts remain unsuccessful to dislodge the armed groups funded by Americans and Saudis during afghan war. It means efforts to restore Pre-80's Pakistan are fruitless.
Question arises, whether Pakistan wants to do so?
Does Pakistan have the ability to do so?
What is your opinion?

I ask only one question from flag holders of humanity.
If you kill their children, will they come to garland you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan.
And question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies, say any logic, argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men, laborers and poor workers of different occupations, in revenge of American attack?
If your answer is no then you need to correct your point of view.
People were armed, at that time their was a danger that Russia will turn toward Pakistan after Afghanistan, therefore people were armed.
Now when there is the danger of American attack via Afghanistan of which current American President clearly expressed in his presidential campaign then why should we disarm these people?
Only for this that after defeating Pakistani Army America or India may not face any public resistance?
Yes, if any of them is involved in sabotage activities then only Pakistan should take action against him.
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeeb ur rehman seiko, *Lahore* [P@KI$T@N]
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
And another question arises that did these terrorists not have the aid of some government or non-government employee of India.
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As far as Laskare Tayyaba is concern it has no involvement in the recent incidents.
It must be recalled that Hafiz Saeed was the first 'Militant Leader' who declared activities of Taliban 'revolt'.
I am quite sure that Taliban agitation is a vital part of American plans. Every person or organization who challenges Taliban in any aspect, must be eliminated. 
Despite the cooperation of the whole nation action against Lashkr due to the pressure of India indicates the nervousness and flatterness of Zardari and Co.
To terminate the expedition started by the American and Saudi funding, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society.
Also protest them that by what ethics American and Saudis are spreaded dangerous arms and so called Jihadi but in fact the virus of  loathsome literature and culture, due to which human butcher houses established in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly. And tried its best that India should attack Pakistan.
This exposed the might of the American Army in the region.
Although India neither made any threat of an attack nor she had the courage to do so.
And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of Taliban or American posts.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and tha Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi is Pakistan's business and economic center and Dubai of the less privileged areas.
Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty handed, but ever since the law and order situation in the western border regions was lost, all people diverted their attention here.
Now they are looking to kidnap this city.
For the first time, Pathans began to be called Pukhtons, and the people of a single town are made foreigners and are being made to fight, while the need is for unity.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speaking learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu, or its better that everybody learns English.
You will surely think this as a ridiculous suggestion but do you think that reason of this conflict is not ridiculous?
That reason of violence is language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, I actually shared this proposal many times in my childhood with my friends, which included people from all religious and linguistic groups, but these people used to laugh at me.
At that time, the religious and linguistic hate, which was not as lively and strong as they are today, were still developing within.
Do not understand what and why is this happening?
Are these the signs of the Day of Judgement?
For what crime are innocent people being killed?
The reasons are in front of everybody. Those who want to break up Pakistan are the active ones, and those who do such things, have neither religion, nor country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns
Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir mean that which is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awaken sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
The identical country loving reaction of all the political, religious, linguistic and national parties has not only taught India the manners of diplomacy but it has also given the American policy makers a chance to think again.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the worse situation in Karachi and administration is not neutral.
The government can control the situation in one hour, but it is purposely allowing it to grow.
Police and Rangers abstained from taking any action since they were in pressure from political parties.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
As long as there will be political pressure on the government, more such incidents will take place. May Allah save Pakistan.
I think these people are the biggest terrorists.
And there must be some foreign hands behind it, but do not know who plays the mischief. 
but alas that if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there, but since its not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
The government should set up an operation here, and save a big and important town from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth due to fear, and as for the local media, it is even thinner.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is this that Urdu speaking people should learn Pashto or Pashto speaking people should learn Urdu or it is even better if everyone learns English.
You will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but don't you think the reason for collision is ridiculous?
that the cause of extremism be language?
There was another story of cruelness recorded in Karachi, terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
Wherever one could do something, he did everything. Reports on the media are 50% of what has happened here in four days.
Have spent the last three nights without sleeping, and the fear is still there.
Those who make the people evacuate hotels, those who kill the shoe-makers and the peanut-sellers.
The people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of Allah's punishment which can catch them anytime.
In your opinion, what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
Keeping in view, the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai, we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in Karachi. It is simple and easy to guess that the turmoil is just due to an unconcious trade of blood.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control.
The blood of Liyaqath Ali Khan and many other brave hearts was also from there. I am writing this poem to get rid of Saiko's misunderstanding.
We will also repeat the traditions of the elders
They gave their lives to build, we will give our lives to save.
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
it is very disappointing that whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
org is searched for Liaqat Ali Khan, you will know that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family of an area of Punjab Karnal.
Because of his service to the Muhajirs, they consider him their leader. 
Every action has a reaction.
One can bear ones self, but..
Ejaz Aiwan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been bearing both types of mischief.
Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan. They did not have to face any reaction.
Contrary to that, they are pecking at the chest of Pakistan.
One Muslim League N was left, even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to People's Party.
Before this MQM and the Muslim League (Q) has already submitted the draft of the 18th amendment in the Assembly and the Senate. 
Till now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why  no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.
It seems that by submitting the draft of the 18th amendment these parties have beaten around the bushes, meaning they can claim that they had submitted the amendment but the ruling party's speaker did not proceed. 
MQM is i coalation with government, Muslim League(N) is secret partnership with government and Muslim League(Q) is the party that passed 17Th ammendment, then how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17Th Amendment
This is what is called getting credit for nothing.
Peoples Party anyway is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment.
Nobody can think of cutting his own hands.
as long as Zardari is the president, seventeenth amendment is not going to be cancelled.
This was the opinion of majority in one of our survey and it is also correct.
If 17th amendment was to be discarded then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf. Because with being the president, he is also the chairman of the People's Party.
as long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.
In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to bid Zardari farewell from the president house.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
Most of the elders in our family belong to labor class.
in our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor work, we used to pray to Allah: that please save us from this hard labor work.
to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what should we do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor work.
The editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and take such and such subjects.
We were inclined towards engineering and in matriculation we studied Technical drawing instead of Biology.
but at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.
We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.
means that the fear from labor work made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.
I remembered this when I was trying to lift the carpet of my old house along with my two young sons.
It was not half an hour since we started working, that the younger son said "Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job"
We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.
The son said that I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work.
Anyway, the three of us finished that work in three hours and returned.
It means that when a man decides the destination, no matter what the motives were behind this, no one can stop him from getting it. 
But if you don’t even know what you have to do, then God be with you. 
It is said that one should not accuse the dead, but sometimes one cannot help it, as we see only evils in her on the first anniversary of Benazir. 
On one side Benazir crushed independence movement of Sikhs by handing over the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India for her own sake and on the other hand provided India an opportunity to fully concentrate in Kashmir after crushing the movement in Punjab.
The greed of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years.
During her exile, Benazir continued to give negative statements on Kashmir and the atomic program. 
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
During her reign, Benazir provided her husband the opportunity to make money. Because of this he became known  as Mr. 10 percent. 
In Benazir's era, her brother was killed, and his killer is still not been punished.
besides being a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
just like Benazir did her politics over her fathers dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came to power twice, but let alone bring the people guilty for the political killing of her father to justice, she could not even file a case against them.
it has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
We should have been observing 16th December as a day of reflection, and made plans to prevent the re occurrence of such incidents.
On that day, we send humanism messages to the people  of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to us.
Rulers open the file of Mehmood-ul-Rehman Commission  in order to study the reasons for the separation of  East Pakistan.
They are making strategies to bring back the Beharis   (ethnic class) stranded in Bangladesh and send them  gifts to encourage them.
But we have become so indifferent that when someone  dies in our own neighborhood we don't  know about it.
We do not care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines of life from the next day.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again, like East and West Germany became one.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be granted in the near future.
When it was announced in the news today that the Governor of the American State Illinois was arrested for corruption charges
and to remove him from governorship provincial Congress is preparing for his rapid accountability, our American friend who has a keen interest in Pakistani affairs exaggeratedly said to me 'see this is democracy'.
In America, even the higher level people can not transcendence the law.
and there is your country Pakistan whose president has been elected after dropping of corruption charges.
My vein of loyalty throbbed and I said what is the big deal if a governor was arrested in America. In our Pakistan, once the Prime Minister was arrested and hanged overnight, and another time sent into exile.
Tell me, when did this happen in America?
In Pakistan, those who broke the law were sent out of the presidential palace with a guard of honor. Tell me when this happened in America.
In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was suspended in such a way that besides the public support he has not be restored so far, did it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan, a fake-degree holder was made the Minister of Health. Did this happen in America?
After listening to this, poor American could not stop laughing and also accepted defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded on all four sides by Americans.
It seems from his smile
he thinks that America is with his government. He is forgetting that one year ago, they were with Pervez Musharraf.
This picture was taken at a family gathering. 
Previously, such a photo was never printed in newspapers before, i.e. one president with three American agents.
It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.
It is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.
If it was a smart ruler, at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo, and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting.
If the principle of democracy is applied on this picture then Present Zardari is in minority.
In democracy, majority rules the country and the picture reveals the actual rulers.
There are enough opportunities in the fields of counseling and psychotherapy.
According to the government tactic so far, along with force, discussions have been going on.
But the use of force is achieving nothing other than strengthening the Taliban and increase in public sympathies for them.
what needs to be done is that the government, instead of using the power, should eliminate the causes of the issue.
By finishing the causes, Fazlullah and the Taliban will be finished themselves.
The Shariat Bill by the ANP government will help address the problem to a great extent. 
But, in addition to the observance of the Shariat law, the administration will take care of the well being of the people.
from the early steps of General Musharaf, it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians, but the lust of power changed all his plans.
Whatever expectations were, after joining the 'war of terror', he began to consider himself irremovable.
The expected actions and the steps arranged was end
When the rule of Bush was coming to an end, he became scared and started dealing with thieves. 
General Musharaf was in a position to control the army. But the present administration does no know what is happening.
If it was Bajaur, or Swat the terror was uncontrollable by army.
Despite the military operation in Swat, a war-torn area of NWFP, things are getting worse.
Translation of the second sentence goes here.
The common citizen has no choice but to obey the rule of power.
In recent years the number of chemical and herbal health supplements has greatly increased in popularity, a major one of which is human growth hormone, commonly known as HGH. 
Result: GOVT is not accepting its failure and Talibans are getting stronger
The poor citizen is the only looser.
In recent years the number of chemical and herbal health supplements has greatly increased in popularity, a major one of which is human growth hormone, commonly known as HGH. 
Then asked about the army. Answer was "very good, it is fighting against the enemies of our country"
Then it was asked, who are the enemies of religion and country, the answer was "the citizens"
I am astonished, how the Pakistan Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban's.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
But still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
After the girls schools, now boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfews are called so that the Taliban can move around easily.
Tonight 8 trucks entered the suburbs of Mingora during curfew and created bunkers.
Question arises, how did they reach there during curfew?
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone explain to the army to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the Army can defeat any enemy.
He says that most of the blood is spilt in the name of religion, tell me that if religion was not then blood wouldnt have spilt?
Are Punjabi, Pathan, White, Black, Mahsood and other tribes the result of religion?
No, sir, no way! Only religion teaches that there is no black and white, there is no Punjabi and no immigrant. If it were not for religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between the white and the black, and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribe-brotherhood hatred.
Actually, religion gives moral teachings to the man. And binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here. And he should spent his life according to his rules.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France, for two years, I also felt the same way.
I don't know why people always expect us to call them.
A resolution about Iraq, passed in a few hours, to send a 'peace' force to Darfur is not at all a problem.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are doing consensus.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
Is the wait really going on for it to finish?
So that no more victim can even imagine to use a weapon of mass destruction like catapult to have his  due rights.
When a father keeps running taking the dead body of his beloved son,even then you don't feel any pain in your heart?
If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
Rather you are a black spot on the name of humanity.
OK, this was proved that this area was also the home of the Israelis for thousands of years.
Ideally, these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection, but since their strings are in the hands of the western and Arab countries, therefore peace is not possible without their will.
and now even Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
Even if operations in Israel are stopped for the time being, they will start again after some other incident.
The interests of BBC homeland are affiliated to America and Israel and this is why under the wrapper of 'broadmindedness' it has produced a series of blogs consisted of 'Jewish favor' and is conducting one sided and blind 'propaganda'.
BBC is only carrying the 'formality' and its objective is to have sympathies!
mr moderator is requested that he may publish the commentry by this humble soul so that one can guess BBC still has some integrity left.
Thanks.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
how can he not realize that whatever is happening is showing the ugliest face of humanity
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time along with Dera Ghazi Khan, in whole country winter rains are goin on.
Presented is a poem according to the season. Enjoy the rain along with this poem.
It rains just because of you
if it rains, its spring
When it stops there is no movement
sometimes comes without a reason
Sometimes it spread day and night.
sometimes loudly, sometimes silently.
These rains are also from you
in some remembrance some night
to a buried ash
Sometimes he put it out
sometimes he lit himself up
Sometimes every drop is like pain.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What is it to them, whether the country lasts or not.
Let the population sell toothpaste or clean the bells of the Mandir with the peels of lemons.
For one, our media is also corrupted, like our leaders.
Its sole purpose is to extract money from the government.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday noon strange thing happened.
The whole police was running here and there but was least bothered about illegal parking.
and moreover that NYPD traffic was also not in a mood to look at illegal parked cars.
it happened like this that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in Hudson river.
Till today only this much is known that the "terrorist" belonged to the family of birds called goose.
Yesterday was perhaps historic cold, in New York.
The temperature does not fall this low. 
My jaw start to ache because of half an hour outside walk.
Just imagine what would have happened with those who jumped of the plane into the river.
The reason for happiness is that all the person were safe.
The dark side is that the company's plane crashed in this financial crisis. 
I went by West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I still do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thanks God,during my an hour trip the road was bit cleared as I get an exit from 56 street.
Otherwise I did not avail the first two exit due to the long lanes of vehicles.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women
Shaguftah: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I have had two chickens. It's a sacrifice. Janzeb will tell you how it was.
Apart from this, there is no other way.
At this farm, one has to get his own meat done,, including removing the skin.
Basim: .Net might take some to repair.
What happened on the forum?

dear sir use Firefox.
The snow will melt. 
We are not related to the Taliban. Taliban opposes education of women. 
They show their anger by demolishing schools and colleges for women. 
But like majority of the ideas, this was not proven right also. According to this news of CNN, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a Boys school with gunpowder.
Swat, The Taliban has destroyed a boys school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Ameen Summa Ameen
By gods grace till now 182 schools have been demolished.
The custom of fixing marriages before birth among Muslims, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See a picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
Some days go, a girl's marriage with a dog become fresh.
look at that groom.
Humanity is rare in 21st century.
Today is the age of computers, and computers' influence is growing in every aspect of life. 
Lots of people have many reservations about this growing interference of computer like in financial issues.
where use of credit card bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
That now with just looking at the credit card transactions record your whereabouts can be traced.
And in future when use of currency will be minimal its utility will increase.
similarly in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, the credit card information is stolen.
Similarly friends are also made through computers.
Social networking sites, like Orkut, Facebook and Myspace are at first level of acceptance.
But do you not think that the more we are following these social networking sites, the further we are getting from people in real life?
Similar are the match making websites, where your desires are matched with others desires and you are shown a list of the people who match with you.
Now can you spend your life with a person like you?
I can't do it, that is why a life partner is called my better half. 
That he/she may cover my deficiencies.
Perhaps I received a lesser share of wisdom.
Since childhood when ever an elder said anything to me that was the truth for me.
In the same way, I was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world.
I was even ridiculed a lot on this
But only plausible things seemed true. 
I was always perplexed at the need to tell a lie. 
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
That is why I try to lie as less as possible.
that I do not falsely please others, that too with the name of Allah.
and Allah willing say only when there is pray to Allah that work completes.
Besides Allah knows what is there in the hearts.
This is a despicable matter that arose due to distance from religion.
According to both our religion and Pakistani law, young children should stay with their mothers.
Their father is responsible for their maintenance allowance and he can meet them.
Then when the kids get mature, they can live with anyone they want.
You are right that the actual problem are the relatives who misguide.
Jagirdar thinking on all of our deeds exercises.
Thinking the same thing here working in the property of the father, a new parts and will be opposed the same otherwise his father, the process is commendable and counterfeiting.
here these restriction regarding making of relations have created many evils in the society.
Related  widow and the concept of marriage is scarce.
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason family breakups.
Why can't our society accept the remarriage of a widowed 50-year old? 
there is a Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago, now after getting all his children married when he married a widow, his own children have gone against him.
In my opinion they have the right? what would be ur opinion?
"To take place of our mother in the being of our mother" what kind of thinking?
In my opinion the children of this person should think that after having married all the kids, is there anything wrong in his marrying a widow?
Thereby, this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
As the children would definitely have gotten busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow if their wives refuse to look after them, when they are old, what will they do?
This result is because of Societies pressure
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society, which we are facing for the last 40-50 years.
A wife can accept her husband going around having illicit relations, but she cannot stand him having a second wife.
If she had the power, she would not allow him to do this even after her death. 
She destroys her husband and her own hereafter, and becomes a cause for spreading filthiness in the society.
Nothing happens with singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.
As for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house, so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax, (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt).
In IndopPak we embraced Islam centuries ago but can't get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then Islam.
Thinking of a man's second marriage as an innovation, divorce as a clinical rest, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife, is all a part of this mentality.
Moreover to copy the western nations we declare veil and worship backward.
Accepting Islam was easy, getting rid of this way of thinking is very hard.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.

Ameer Taimur in his book "I am Taimur" writes I found the secret in my living time that if the commander of any army is present on the front line then that army will never be defeated.
But here situation is else.

if someone from common people dies then murder
May peace and blessing of Almighty be upon you.
I was coming back to my shop after the Isha prayer tonight, a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called.
I thought that probable this man has lost his way or wants to ask something, I stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked whether I could understand Arabic well or not. I said no problem, tell me what you want.
He started to say that I have come from Riyadh, to Madinah, but someone has pick-pocketed me, so please help me out. I asked him to excuse me, as such an incident had taken place with me previously, that I had given the person 20 Riyals to buy petrol to reach Riyadh, but he went a little ahead and started to ask somebody else.
I was furious, I cursed him and threatened him of the Police, then he ran away.
Now the situation  has become, that we Muslims come on cars, with our families to beg throughout the day and gain at least two or three thousand illegally.
Whereas there is a clear Hadith of the Prophet (SAWS) that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand; the lower hand being the begging hand and the upper hand being the giving one.
May Allah bless us and make us true Muslims (Amen)

Famous singer Adnan Sami's wife reached a police station in Mumbai, accusing him of torturing her.
, police has advised her to consult the court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Guladari submitted a plea against her husband that Adnan Sami tortures her continuously.
and treats her inhumanely.
Now this thing has gone out of her tolerance, therefore, a case may be registered against Adnan Sami.
, in place of filing case police asked her to consult the court by saying that this case is not under the jurisdiction of police.
In your opinion, is the accusation against Adnan Sami, by his wife proper?
Is it not an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Let us know what you think about this matter. 
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
As far as the allegations are concerned, anyone can make them against any other person. 
nothing more important than respect.
Whatever be the case between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he had left his honorable life and went to India to earn money. Now that fame has fallen around his neck.
This is the result of his own actions.
Washington...
top American officials say that president Obama will take strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
In America's new policy for Afghanistan, instead of development, war has been given more importance.
The envoys say that Hamid Karzai is being considered a barrier in the achievement of American goals in Afghanistan, as there is corruption in the government and the business of middlemen has increased and the Taliban are once more gathering strength.
The American officials also said that those people in the current administration who are pressurizing Hamid Karzai to do more include, Vice President Joe Biden and American Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrook
They stated that the policy change came after President Bush left office, who used to have video conferencing with Hamid Karzai fortnightly and emphasized the American role in the rebuilding of Afghanistan and its civil institutions.
Officials say that Obama management will work with the state leaders as a backup with the main government.
They said that they will ask Hamid Karzai to intensify the campaign against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing fresh elections this year, and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his group will support Karzai for presidency or not.
Is this statement, of the American officials, a forecast of change in American policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is Hamid Karzai's rule coming to an end?
What is your opinion about this?
In a series of three one day matches between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2-1.
In the first one day match Pakistan defeated SriLanka, however SriLanka won the remaining two matches.
The national cricket team in the third one - day match is very poor performance , Sri Lanka 's national team only in response to 309 runs ڈھیرہوگئی on 75 runs in 23 overs , and thus it faced a lesson nose of the defeat . 
The result of the series shows the inconsistency of our cricket team's performance
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
Which aspects of the game should experts focus on?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
which department you will hold responsible for the defeat, fielding, batting or bowling?
Kindly share your opinion.
Malik Babar Husain, Jeddah. It is very sad that even in todays modern age, such ignorant traditions are prevalent. If the landlord or the property owner targets innocent people with his harsh dictatorship, who will call them Muslims?
Let any big shot walk on these burning coals. Why does the government allow them to do that?
When will the court system work? 
The Sri Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan to participate in a one-day international series. 
besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
On reaching Karachi Airport, the Sri Lankan team was given a warm welcome. 
Two matches will be held between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Karachi, while the third one will be played in Lahore. 
Both teams are asserting highly regarding their batting, bowling and fielding.
If the Sirilankans are proud of their spinners than Pakistan has its fast bowlers.
Sir Lanka’s captain Mahela Jayawardene says that no one player but the whole Pakistan cricket team is dangerous.
Muralidharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, while Pakistan’s captain says that this competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik has said that we have played Murlidharn and will see Mendas as well, we have develop a secret game plan which we will show at the ground.
will the Pak-Srilanka Series be really as interesting and exciting as the claims are?
Which side will dominate in the Pakistan and Sri Lanka series? 
Who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Give your opinion.
Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.
Malik Yousuf, Dubai
It is all these people's doing Kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years.
no one ask about that now they have stuck with fundamentalism and fight for terrorism so they now start talking about deal.
first they killed Muslims brutally now they are trying to resolve issues.
although Pakistan have to understand there two way policy.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating this situation to distract world attention away from Kashmir issue.
but Pakistan always shows India real face to the world.
Now British government has realized that Indian government is maligning Pakistan for terrorism so that it can occupy Kashmir.
and they hesitate to talk to Pakistan over this issue.
British foreign minister David Miliband said that by resolving Kashmir issue will end extremism. Pakistan government will be able to handle the border issues.
It should be noted that American president Obama has already expressed similar views on Kashmir issue.
British foreign minster while talk with media and writes on one essay that though of fight against terrorism is wrong for challenge of danger for its own safety killed people is the policy of Bush.
David Miliband has said that Pakistan should show lineancy towards extremist groups.
Is India creating uncertainity in the region to avoid the resolution of Kashmir issue by big powers?
Are the Mumbai attacks the part of the plan?
Does India want to avoid the comprehensive talks by on the basis of terrorism?
Tell us your opinion.
Usman Aftab
I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
In fact are thinking of means to control Pakistan. They know Pakistan is an atomic power.
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign counties are thinking that if Pakistan is cornered that will pose more political and geographical problems. They want to help Pakistan and want to achieve their vested interests.
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get problems often in a while and they start threatning Pakistan.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.

Raas Al Khaima, It is due to America that wrong statements are being given , America is out of its mind but now India is also doing the same, India should try attacking , then it will become crystal clear that who stands where.

The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.

All decisions will be made in the parliament.

As the President, I have taken steps according to the situation and the Constitution and under the law, given priority to the American interests on my popularity. 
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.

This is very hurtful incident that Israel is publicly massacring the Palestinians, same situation is here in Kashmir but Security Council do not even bother by it.
All the groups that are in Kashmir and Palestine, should keep the war going for freedom, and unitedly fight any force that opposes them. One day their martyrdom will bear fruit, God willing.
Israeli air attacks still continues in Gaza, since now several Palestinian Men, Women and children have been martyred.
The important Political Person of HAMAS Nazariyan has killed along with his family.
The Security Council session ended without a decision. 
The conference was conducted against Isreal by Libya and other gulf countries, and the report was submitted to America
Israeli airplanes bombardment is continued since many days on Palestinian civil population.
The whole world reacted on Mumbai attacks but no country including America and England can see bloodshed caused by Israeli attacks.
Why are the major countries of the Muslim world silent? 
What is your opinion on these double standards of the world.
Saeed, New York.
I think that actually, most of our people are illiterate. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties, the electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has taken a serious position.
On the other hand price of Gas has been increased by 18%. While due to unavailability of petrol, people are facing sever difficulties.
The business and industrial communities of Pakistan are violently protesting against power and Gas crisis.
The producers have given the ultimatum to close the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is perturbed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
The production life cycle has become practically paralyzed.
The government institutions are blaming each other to express their stand.
Increasing the prices of electricity and gas is not a joke with people?
Why did not pay attention to solve these problems.
The government is not going to work for upwards.
What will you suggest about the control this big problem.
Let us know of your opinions.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that government carrying slogan of public service is itself hurting them.
The unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a torture.
Government has no control over the institutions.
The law and order situation is getting worse, day to day. May Allah have mercy on this country.

After ruling over America for eight years, President Bush left the White House, for presidential camp office, Camp David, so that the White House can be decorated and prepared for new President Barack Obama, according to his wishes.
During Bush's eight years rule, the historical attacks and destruction of the World Trade Center, attack on Pentagon and then in the name of war against terror, attacking Afghanistan and Iraq and involving forces from other countries into the war and use of American resources in it have become memorable examples of his time.
As a result of this war, America had to face the worst economic and financial crisis in history.

Vice president of Indian cricket board Mr. Ragiv Shukla told Geo News that he has sought permission for the tour of Pakistan from Indian government but due to current tensions between the two counties the tour has been canceled.

Is the Indian government's decision not harmful for cricket?
Despite security concerns English team visited India then why can't the Indian team continue its tour of Pakistan.

Salman, Karachi.
Those people who feel proud of visiting India
and they make their films and videos over there, their eyes should open now, as to how much the people of India respect you.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami in which he said that he is not Pakistani national but a British.
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan at the first opportunity, because he did not get honor there either.
Farid Ahmad

After the Mumbai attacks, the mode of the Indians have changed.
Jagjeet Singh reacted by expressing that he hates Pakistan and Pakistanis.
It should be known that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsle and how has he become helpless now? Adnan Sami should stay in India. There is no need for him to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam
Karachi, i will only say this on the statement of Jagjit Singh that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Mumbai attack their feeling of hate has increased.Now they are talking against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
according to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said "You dog this is a farewell kiss"
After this, the journalist took his shoe off and threw it at Bush. President Bush ducked with expertise and saved himself from getting hit by the shoe.
The second shoe hit the American flag.
Security personnels dragged the journalist away from there.
On this occasion, President Bush said that he did not know why he did that, the shoe was of size ten, he was not bothered.
In your opinion, does this action of the journalist show the anger of the Iraqi public against President Bush.
What do you say about this incident?

It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she changed totally.
But it's also true that she ignored the senior members of her party and nominated her own son as the representative of the People's Party. What sort of democracy is it?

Our rulers should understand that the people they are fighting against are our own. Who are taking upon every problem because they love Pakistan
If a war occurs, then they will fight for Pakistan. 
When their love would be felt, just condenming politics will not work. I think between both, there might be going a resulting war.
