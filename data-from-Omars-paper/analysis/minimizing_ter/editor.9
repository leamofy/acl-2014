1990 Was First Nuclear Test
Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer, had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.
In this book, called 'Nuclear Express', the political history of the bomb and its proliferation, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or got help from a nuclear power.
Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990 during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Thomas Reid said that, due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Among the factors are the design of the bomb and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.
He further added that that was the reason Pakistan was able to reply to India's nuclear test with a nuclear test of its own in just 2 weeks and 3 days.
Thomas Reid reminded us that in 1961 Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test, in response to which America took 17 days to perform a test, despite having had this bomb for a long time.
He added that the atom bomb that was tested on May 19, 1998 by Pakistan was made very carefully and had complete confidence of Pakistani scientists.
When Thomas Reid was asked why China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said that India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.
He said that there was proof available that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design. Subsequently, the documents received from Libya support this fact.
Further questioning as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.
He said that we also believe that Israel has access to the results of this testing.
Thomas Reid was also asked about China's ongoing nuclear distribution program.
Thomas Reid responded that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Asfahan, Iran since 1991.
Apart from this, China provided Iran with the nuclear enrichment plant in Kheraj.
He said that China has been providing Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt and Libya with nuclear technology through North Korea.

Administrator for Jamaa'athud Da'wah
The central headquarters of Jamaa'athud Da'wah is in Taibah, about 25 kilometers from Karachi.
This center includes a hospital, a school and a hostel for students.
The law minister of Punjab, Rana Sanaullah Khan, says that supervisors were appointed in the center of Jamaa'athud Da'wah so that the work of social institutes there can go on unaffected.
According to Khalid Waleed, the son-in-law of the Jamaa'athud Da'wah chief, Hafiz Saeed, a high ranking government officer, Khaqan Babar, was appointed for the supervision of the hospital, school and other social institutes, based in the center, as the administrator, while the posting of police at the center was also increased.
The Security Council has passed a ban on Jamaa'athud Da'wah, after which the Pakistani government has started taking action against Jamaa'athud Da'wah across the country, and has put the chief of the Jamaa'ath, Hafiz Saeed, along with other leaders under house arrest. The appointment of the administrator in the Taibah center by the Punjab government was also a part of the action being taken against Jamaa'athud Da'wah by the joint government.
Khaqan Babar belongs to the DMG (District Management Group).
Hafiz Khalid Waleed said that the Commissioner of Lahore division, Khusroe Pervez Khan, along with police and the civil government, came on Sunday and inspected the Taibah center. Khalid Waleed spoke ill about the appointment of an administrator by the government in Jamaa'athud Da'wah, and he said that the number of patients in the hospital and children in the school had already dropped due to government actions.

According to Republicans, this economic package would not prove a failure
In the House, this economic package is passed on a 244 to 188 vote

Bitterness between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Israeli president, almost screaming, that the blood of many humans were spilled in Gaza, and it saddened him to see that people could watch and applaud this armed killing from Israel.
Mr. Erdogan said, "I believe that you are using such words to erase your guilty feeling, and out loud, as well. But you killed those people, and I am remembering those children who were killed near the shore."
Simon said that Gaza's calamity is not Israel, but Hamas, who have established a dangerous dictatorship over there.
A BBC journalist from Davos said that he had never seen such a scene in an global economic forum before.
However, Erdogan later stated that he respected the Israeli president and his age, which is why he did not scream at him, but whatever he was saying was very far from the truth.
Turkey is one of the few Muslim countries which has a diplomatic relationship with Israel. But displeasure has been materializing between the two recently.
'The attack was not planned by Pakistan'
When talking to ND TV, an Indian channel, Wajid Shamsul Hassan stated that the Pakistani investigation report on Mumbai attack would be executed.
The attack occurred in Mumbai last November, more than 120 people were killed.

The Mumbai attack has badly affected the relationship between the two countries.
When talking about the Pakistan investigation report on the incident, the high commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hassan has given out a hint about the whereabouts of the report.
Wajid Shamsul Hassan said that in the light of the investigation it is understood that Pak land had not been used for organizing the attack.
It might have been some other land that had organized the attack.
These are the two places (Pakistan and Britain) about which I was worried.
India and the international community have created a lot of pressure on Pakistan to take action against the culprits of the Mumbai attacks.
Wajid Shamsul Haq said: We are not trying to cover it up.
We believe in taking action based on facts.
The world will accept our investigations.
We will try to satisfy India over the results of the investigation.
While defending the delay in the investigation in Pakistan, he said that it takes time to collect, understand and check these kind of things.
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Haq said that it took 45 days for India to present its dossier.

Omar Abdullah says that he will play his role in making talks possible between the Indian Government and the Separatists. However, this is not possible until the elections in India and the formation of the new government.
The Role of EU for peace in the Middle east.
The official point of view is that the role of the European Union is a decisive one in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
According to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of the Schwarzenberg delegation and Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
The European Union's spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, has said that all these efforts are commendable if they convey the European Union's message to the opponents of the war.
Everything seems fine, as far as the official statement is concerned.
However, in reality, the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of internal tensions.
As the head of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is even weaker than before.
And, on top of that, internal issues have made it helpless.
On the other hand, French president Sarkozy is behaving as if he were still President of the European Union.
He is doing so despite the fact that France has completed its six-month presidential tenure.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and is capable of doing so, but he does not have the authority to do so.
The most comedy situation is for the Ambassdor of France Mr. Bernard Kouchner
He is also involved in this, with guidance from the Ambassador of the Czech Republic, Mr. Schwarzenberg.
Not only do they have differences of opinion, but they might have to face a battle with the western world.
they said that for the defence the Isreal they might has to face the war, even though it doesn't appear like that,  on the other side Germany also posted a person towards the east side. till Europeoan Union come to an conclusion, they wont win the battle
This is the proof of Isreal, which is doesn't provide any response to the European Countries.
This is the best time for the European Union to perform because America has failed on the western side due to the policies of George W. Bush.

The goal of advertising is to sell the product or let the people know the various facilities made available to them, either at the market or at their doorstep.
When a product is being advertised we are able to gather more information, such as its name, price, benefits and availability in short.  Tt is a brief actual account of itself.
But sometimes the drafted messages tend to be fictional too, owing to either exaggeration or to false claims made by the advertiser. Viewed objectively, the advertising message must act as a salesperson and do its best to convince consumer of the merits of the product.
The words used in advertisements are typical of a salespersons' language and this is how he would like to convince his prospective buyer, should they come face to face.
The name of this advertisement is, "Ratiopharm". The words used by the salesperson, definitely praise the product or service that is available.
More often, they are colorful and catchy words as they persuade the customer to respond favorably and force him to purchase the product. Unless cosmetics and other like Kassbohrer products are heavily promoted, they will languish unsold on the shelves of this stores for a long time.
Advertising always puts forward the best points of the product. Advertisement can be educative, entertaining, informative handy and surely interesting.
At times, however, they tend to be boring, irritating and embarrassing.
Another category of advertisements tends to brag so as to tempt the buyers.
But whatever it be, advertisements have a two-fold purpose to serve. They have a message to convey and they attempt to evoke a desirable response in the buyer. As a result 400 VEM product becomes a popular ones; the demand increases.

According to latest statistics, the rate of crime among immigrants from 2004 to 2007 is 22 percent.
Decline from 9% to 0.21%
has reached 4 percent
According to Interior minister Joachim Herrmann of the province Bavaria, this is a superficial positive change.
He said, "This should be noted that the number of outsiders seeking immigration of Germany is increasing."
Hence, this should also be stated in statistics that the criminal is a German citizen, but his background is non-immigrant.
He said that his province will also consider this while collecting statistics.
A part of the Bavaria plan is also being planned in Hamburg.
The Senator for foreign affairs from CDU, Christoph Ahlhaus, has said: "When the research is done in a scientific manner, the man can not pre-decide its results but it is based on the facts and figures that come out as a result of the research."
Ahlhaus diverted the attention to a research report from the anti crime's provincial office which was prepared in 2006. According to this report in Bergdorf (a part of Hamberg), it was revealed that out of all crimes happening there a certain percentage involved foreigners.
results showed that the foreigners here have
The crime rate was less when compared to the crime rate  all across the province.
In contrast, a 2006 survey was done on crimes in youth in Berlin and it concludes young people having foreign backgrounds were in the 44%.
was 7 percent
However, other political parties of Germany such as SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei were against this proposal. While collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be included as to German citizens have a foreign background.

Al-Qaida's Video Message to Germany
This thirty-minute video shows a man wearing a black turban to cover his face while holding a gun in his hand as he addresses the German government.
The same man is introducing himself as the Father of Talha and is talking in German.
Arabic subtitles are present in this video message.
There is a log of Al-Qaeda on the side of the screen and the video has a date of October 2008.
In this message, it said the German Government is the country expressing their belief that they will not be attacked after sending an army in a great numbers to Afghanistan. If this is not innocent, then what is it?
This man calling himself ""Father of Talha"" did not threaten an attack on Germany indirectly.
In Afghanistan, the number of German army soldiers included in the United army NATO is almost 3500 at this time.
In October last year, German Parliament has approved of sending 1000 more soldiers to Afghanistan.
This is the first message received by Germany from Al-Qaeda.
Mikhael Luders, who keeps a close watch on the activities related to terrorism, says in relation to this message :"" The suicide bombing outside the German consulate recently has proved that we should take the taliban seriously in every condition.
For the last few years, AL-Qaeda has been distributing messages over the internet and there have been attacks after such messages.
The militant group the Taliban has taken responsibility for the terrorist attack outside the German Embassy this weekend.
Most German papers and analyzers are linking this attack with the message of Al Qaeda.
They are targeting Germany.
Muslim hard liners see Germany's Afghan policy in a negative and questionable light.
They blame the German government for adopting biased policies not just towards Afghanistan, but also toward the Middle East.
And for this reason they are increasingly finding Germany as their enemy.
The German government stated that undercover agencies knew about the video even before it came out publicly.
The German federal anti-crime organization was investigating the contents of the video.
Obama takes office as President of the United States.
In this crisis the American people are on one side while the rest of the world is expecting different things from Obama.
Now, as Barack Obama is receiving greetings and congratulations from all over the world on becoming the President of the United Staets, the expectations for him are increasing.
In this regard, the German Chancellor Angela Merckle has expressed confidence in the American president.
"I am sure that based on the friendship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America, we can resolve all the issues faced."
Russian prime minister Vladimir Putin has said that Obama appears to a serious and open-hearted man. This is really good news.
Meanwhile, the policies of former American President George W. Bush have been facing criticism.
However, many appreciate his stance in encouraging China to play a more constructive international role. All China has said about the new American president is that he will have to work for stronger military relations between both countries.
Based in the German city of Bochum, Chinese political expert Kusuay Wu says,
"In this regard, I am sure that in the coming weeks and months, Obama and his team of economists will put immense pressure on China to have a more flexible and competitive market exchange rate for the Chinese currency."
The previous American regime has also improved relations with India.
As to how far Obama can take these relations, Christopher Raj, professor of American Studies in New Delhi says, "Now we have come closer in strategic partnership. However, Obama can not bring an overnight change."
In a message sent to Obama by Pope Benedict, he also stressed the need to create an environment of peace and mutual help in the world.
State Elections in Israel
This is the first important election in this war-ridden country since 2005.
In the state elections more than 14,400 contestants have entered the contest for 440 seats.
To maintain peace and safety during the elections, 800,000 police and soldiers were posted in Iraq.
Fearing that some bomb blast or terrorist attack might take place on this important day, all the borders of Iraq were sealed one day in advance, i.e. on Friday.
In addition, the airport was closed and restrictions were placed on public transport.
According to reports, due to the restrictions on public transport, there was no traffic on the roads of Baghdad, and children were seen playing football on the roads.
During the present Iraqi elections, the security arrangements will tell us two things: first, whether or not the local security agencies will be able to take over the country after the return of the American forces from Iraq in 2011, and second, to what extent is the public prepared to bring change to the country in democratic ways.
The state elections are being held with help from the United Nations as almost 800 international supervisors are overlooking the elections.
Today is celebrated as Ashoora day all over Iran, with high reverence and piety, and with the remembrance of the Leader of martyrs Imam Hazrat Husaian.

Israeli troops' retreat from Gaza Corridor, stern defense put up by Palestine fighters.
According to Mahar news reports of Urdu service,even on the 16th day of the battle between good and evil, the Israeli troops showered bombs on the city dwellers. 880 people have so far martyred in the land-sky-sea attack of the Israeli troops and 3700 Palestines have been severely injured.
The martyrs include 275 innocent children. They embraced death smiling at the faces of deceitful Arab leaders and the organizations pretending to be working for international human rights.
The Israeli troops were forced to leave Ujain in Gaza today because of the strong resistance of the masked Palestine soldiers. They exhibited magnificent defense with the help of their strong faith and desire for sacrifice. They engage in a do or die battle against the Zionist enemies.
But for the treacherous stand of the Egyptian President, Husni Mubarak, the brave and solid fighters of Hamas would have thrown the Israeli troops into the pit of shameful defeat. Unfortunately, the Egyptian Muslims also kept the Palestines under siege along with the Israeli troops. It is the most tragic incident in the history of Arabia.
There can be seen that Saudi Arabia and the Udar government both extend political as well as financial assistance to Israel. Similarly, they join hands with Israel to deceive the Musalmans of Gaza who are put in unending miseries.

He said that the lack of completion of the Iraqi mission and improvements in social security are his biggest mistakes.
President Bush said that he did everything possible for the protection of America.
In response to several questions asked about Israeli aggression in Gaza, President Bush replied that Israel has the right to protect herself, but Hamas does not and Hamas should not attack Israel and like America the whole world should strangle the oppressed instead of the oppressor.
America's most incompetent and ineffective president said that Hamas should not be provided arms, however America is giving the most deadly weapons to Israel, who are using these weapons in the Palestinian genocide. He Also criticized pro Israeli Arabs and declared them friends of Israel.
Bush was embarrassed about the crimes committed in the Abu Graib and Guantanamo bay prisons.
Experts say that Bush should be tried for war crimes and that the organizations who will do this will do great benefit to mankind.
Iranian President Ahmedi Nizad regreta the silence of Arab countries.
According to news agencies, Iranian president Doctor Ahmedi Nizad has strongly criticized silence of Arab leaders on the recent Israeli aggression and oppression.
President Ahmedi Nizad is "shocked" at the silence of Arab countries and their leaders on the Israeli aggression in Gaza and said that Israel is committing a Holocaust of Palestinians, and terrorizing Palestinian children, women and ordinary citizens.
President Ahmede Nejad has called upon all the Arab countries to unite against Israel and to save the oppressed Muslims of Gaza from Israel's harm and tyranny.
Ahmede Nejad: Saudi King should clarify his stance on the  Gaza genocide.
According to the report by MAHAR/MEHR news agency, President Ahmede Nejad in his message to the Saudi King Malik Abdullah, declared that the silence on the genocide in Gaza and muteness on the murder of innocent children and women by the Muslim King of Saudi Arabia is a reason that is encouraging of the enemies of Islam.
President Ahmede Nejad has said in his message- "You should show your true stance on Gaza and declare support for the oppressed, so that the enemy's efforts of planting differences in the Islamic block should fail."
President Ahmede Nejad has said further that- "You know that for the last 19 days, Israel has been bent on genocide, murdering innocent children, subjecting homes, mosques, schools and hospitals to barbaric bombing. The Zonist Regime is brutally murdering the unarmed Muslims in Gaza. In situations like these, silence on the part of leaders like you is only encouraging Israel."
President Ahmede Nejad has told Malik Abdullah that even non- Muslim countries like Venezuela and Bolivia have taken concrete steps against Israel and that he is expected to take better steps.
President Ahmede Nejad told the Palestinians that success will be at their feet in Gaza.
and the oppressed will win over the oppressors and that's Allah's promise.
President George Bush: Terrorism is still a threat to the USA.
MEHER/MAHAR news agency has copied with reference from the German news agency that the US President while addressing his successor Barak Obama and the nation in his farewell speech, said that though the US is safer than it was seven years ago but the threat of terrorism still looms over USA.
Bush said that the enemy terrorists are waiting patiently to attack America, and they have a strong determination to attack America, so America should never be unaware about its security.
The American President ignored the hurt and suffering of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, and defended his policies saying that America is still the biggest supporter country of independence. However, commentators do not accept the reality of the unpopular president's remarks, as America is neither a supporter of freedom, nor a supporter of human rights, but rather it is the most mischievous country in the world, which not only supports a bloodthirsty country like Israel, but is also directly involved in its crimes.
Israel openly kills children, women and civilians and the American president is congratulating them. This is the American humanity and freedom which the world is seeing in Gaza and other places.
Usama Hamdan: Presence of army in Palestine continues
According to a report by the Mehr News Agency, the Hamas leader in Lebanon, Usamah Hamdan, told French News Agency, during an interview, that the one-sided ceasefire from Israel's side is against the comprehensive international efforts for a ceasefire. He said that as long as Israel is present in Gaza, a one-sided ceasefire is meaningless.
He said that the one-sided ceasefire was an unsuccessful effort of Israel to escape defeat. Hamdan said that if Israel wants long-term peace, it will have to accept Hamas's conditions as well as end this siege.
The Hamas leader in Lebanon made it clear that if Israel tries a one-sided ceasefire with its army remaining in the Gaza belt, there will be resistance against it.
Addressing a one way conference from Beirut, the Usamah Hamdan called for the European countries to break ties with Israel.
The Hamas leader said that the increasing numbers of the martyred and injured will only increase our determination.
He told the Palestinian public to stay firmly rooted and resist the enemy like a boulder.
Taliban have killed six people in Pakistan's tribal area of north Wazirastan.
Meher reporting agency copied with reference to Reuters that Taliban have killed 2 Afghans and 4 Pakistanis over accusation of espionage in Pakistan's tribal area of north Wazirastan.
According to reports, on Tuesday morning locals found four bodies from Tehsil Chowk in Tehsil Mir Ali, who were shot dead.
Two bodies were found thrown in the market of a bazaar in the capital of Miranshah.
Letters written in Urdu have also been found near the bodies in which it is claimed that the dead were involved in espionage.
Also, two weeks earlier, in Miranshah, capital of north Wazirastan, two Afghanis were killed over accusations of espionage.
Over the last twelve days, fifteen people have been killed over charges of espionage for America.
It should be clear that during last six years more than a hundred people have been killed in south and north Wazirastan on accusations of espionage. Taliban are accused of being involved in these murders.
Barack Obama is expected to undersign the closure orders of the infamous Guantanamo Bay prison.
Mehr Reporting Agency has cited sources that say the American president will sign off on the closure of the infamous Guantanamo Bay prison.
The new American president, Barack Husain Obama, started working on his campaign promises at the surface level.
In this regard, President Obama called for planning to withdraw the army from Iraq. He will sign an order today to close the notorious Guantanamo Bay prison.
It is being expected that President Barack Obama will probably sign an order today by which the Guatenamo prison will be closed within one year.
Apart from this, the White House is expected to revise suspected terrorism investigation methods and ban ill treatment of prisoners during interrogation.
President Barack Obama started to fulfill his election campaign promises from his first day in office. One of his first steps was to work toward making the workings of the government transparent.
Experts say that the American president has begun efforts to save the falling image of America throughout the world. That will be difficult, because as long as it keeps supporting the bloodthirsty Israeli government, it can not be expected to do anything good. Therefore, if America wants to save its image, it will have to stop its support of Israel and disassociate itself from Israel's crimes.
Tony Blair stresses need to include Islamic organization, Hamas in talks
Mehr news agency quoted from the Britain newspaper, The Times, that former Prime Minister Tony Blair stressed upon the need to include Hamas in talks to bring about peace in the Middle East.
According to the Times, Tony Blair said that it is important that a path be found for bringing Hamas into the Middle East peace process. Blair criticized the Bush administration for speaking only to Mahmood Abbas and ignoring Hamas. It should be clear that the Western countries have realized the democratic and organizational powers of Hamas and are calling for bringing them into the talks, whereas previously they used to consider it a terrorist organization. A terrorist organization which is trying to defend its country and struggling to save its own home from the clutches of others. Whose home and country have been in the hand of the occupying Israeli government for 60 years.

Why reduction in exercise with increase in the age
New Research
Exercise is good for health in every age
This keeps the heart healthy,reduces the level of cholesterol,Helps in keeping the weight low, helps in reduction of sugar and reduces Alzheimer meaning decreases the speed of dementia.
Unfortunately, in many people with the increase in the age, the capability to carryout exercise also decreases.
The specialists say that with exercise our body and brain remain active but age can have effect on it.
The American Medical Association says that Many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out.
Doctor Patrisha Pae Leka of the Meo Clinic in Mani Sotta says that the reason for the the increase is due to the lack of exercise and our bodies inability to function properly.
Doctor Patrisha teaches medicine at the Meo Clinic.
She researched heart illnesses in elderly people and the benefits of exercise.
A team of doctors used high frequency sound layers to test how well the heart was functioning.
They studied the effectiveness of the heart while pumping blood, looking at the entire beating cycle.
The experts had given full attention to the left side of the heart since it is the part that pumps the blood.
They came to know that with the growing age the grievousness is added in the respiration work of the heart.

Indian Army Chief: "No Chance of War With Pakistan In Near Future"
Indian Army chief Gen. Depak Kapoor said that there is no chance of war with Pakistan. "However, we are ready to protect our national interests at any cost," he added.
General Kapoor asserts that, despite international pressure, a terrorist network still exists and is active on Pakistani soil.
He was speaking to journalists in Sri Nagar.
The Indian Army chief is on a one-day visit to the Kashmir Valley to observe the activities of the armed forces on the borders.
When asked to comment about Pakistan's rejection of Indian proofs related to the Mumbai attacks, Gen.Kapoor said that the political leadership is responsible for dealing with issues related to war and peace.
When asked to comment about Pakistan's rejection of Indian proofs related to the Mumbai attacks, Gen. Kapoor said that the political leadership is responsible for dealing with issues related to war and peace.
There are riots and protests in Pakistan. It is reported that there would be a tremendous battle between India and Pakistan. Pakistan has aimed to weaken the Indian Army.
It is reported that there are about 700-800 men in the army in Kashmir, of which about 50% of the army men are foreign men.
General Deepak Kapoor has reported that there is some improvement in the K.I.K atmosphere. He has also said Pakistan has increased the efforts of battle on the Pakistan dependent Kashmir. Therefore, we have increased the Army camps at the Indian borders.
It is reported that he has increased the number in the army in the India dependent Kashmir. He has clearly mentioned from the symptoms that there cannot be any compromise with regard to the protection of the country.
Oh God, Please accept our prayers. Please prove Barack Obama to be good for this world.
It is evident from the present situation that there are slight chances of getting a positive response. Still we will wait and see to what extent the Pakistan-American Relationship changes and what benefit it can give to us.
What inspiration does Mr. Barack gives to this world with regards to the inspiration and aims of the Martin Luther King?
Obama, with part of his name is Hussein, is going to take the oath as an American Leader. He is going to be a protector of a country and its history. This is an exam for the Americans.
Not only is it for the sake of their community, but also for all those who have supported him with their heart and soul.
This test will happen on the extreme white paper. It is not easy for him to write on the blue paper whole-heartedly. He would rule the country with justice.
Here in South Asia, Muslims who have expectations from him, should remember that he has been elected as the President of the United States. And Obama should remember that being President of the United States actually means being the President of the entire world.
A man whose brothers and sisters were brought to America as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, this will be a win for the people who love him.
What will be its effect on South Asia, and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan?

Whether it is by Obama or some one else, the policy of the entire world is done by Jews who lobby billionaires and influence powerful and effective people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts, the offensive reactions of India, America and Israel are in front of everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat, who had a regular army and made laws.
He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a  pact.
But it is regrettable that our government treated Swat as an adversary.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the Swat self-rule ended.
And no interest was taken in building infrastructure.
The number of girls who are getting an education today is much smaller than the number of those who used to get educated in the previous era.
In the Frontier Province, there is a continuous targeting of educational institutions by the Taliban.
The largest number of schools destroyed has been in the district of Swat, and the majority of those are girls schools.
The Taliban has imposed a ban on education for all females.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting an education.
what do you think are the Taliban's objectives in ending women's education?
Why is the government unable to stop these unlawful acts?
What do you think the government should do?
The question is, what are the benefits for the ISI and other Pakistani agencies?
Now, the people of Swat understand the game:  The military is there to support the Taliban, not to kill them, for how is it possible that 5 schools can be blown up in Karfuo, and people slaughtered and hanged in the street?
When there is no government authority left, then how can government stop these unlawful acts?
Now the question that arises is why, with all their advanced technology, destructive weapons, and an effective spy system, the Taliban are still not in control?
The answer is they have the hand of some secret power, which is why their weapons never run out and they are never arrested.
The conclusion is that the Taliban, through there actions, are making the work easier for World Powers.
War has been raging in Afghanistan for the past 15 years.
ISI is controlling the Taliban when at that time their opponent was the North Coalition who was supported by Russia, India, and Iran.
Then suddenly the situation changed, and actions of the Taliban began to appear.
ISI was also offered dollars from America, causing past friends to become enemies.
Now the situation is that this war continues, but still helping Pakistan are Iran, India, and Russia.
Unless humans discover right and wrong then they will keep making mistakes.
For example, if a thief who goes to steal gets the thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse with punishment, then he fears from God and will not steal.
Unless Israel understands that they are doing wrong and spilling the blood of innocents, then they will get punishment for it. They will keep playing with the blood of innocents of Gaza till then.
Respects!
Is war, armed movement, and terrorism a solution to problems?
If not, then what is the solution of the problems?
It is right that the war is the way that does not solve the problem but make it more difficult.    You correctly say that war makes the problem more difficult rather than solving it.
Falastin,Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the way which adopted Nalis Mandaila in South Africa to make their movements success.    Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the methods used by Nelson Mandella in South Africa to make their movements successful.
That mean there should be behaver and politics efforts in more then force.    This means that changing behavior and political efforts should take precedence over the use of force.
The participating of Kashmirian public in election tells that they accepted this view.    We can tell that the Kashmirian public has accepted this point of view, judging by their participation in the election.
The third week is continue of Israel attacks on Ghaza and dead persons are about 1000.    About 1000 people are dead in the third week of continuing Israeli attacks on Gaza.
The war could not stopped until this time with world ambassador efforts.    Only the efforts of world ambassadors can stop the war at this time.
And according to a guess 9000 Falatinis have been left their homes and gone to save places after the attacks  starting in December.    It is estimated that 9000 Falatinis left their homes and sought safe haven after the attacks started in December.
And here helpful institutions blamed Israel that he did not care the Falastini children and there will be one total posterity in hard mental and emotional problems.    Humanitarian institutions have accused Israel of not caring for Falastini children, and the consequences will be challenging mental and emotional problems for many years to come.
What do you say?    What did you say?
Is it should be?    What should it be?
How could it long term peace be possible in Gaza?

Wake up. If Taliban will do real Jihad to sacrifice innocent people.
who burnt out girls schools?
and if kidnap for ransom or not get ransom so who will hang people on the pole by called them American spy?
Those Taliban give more damage to Islam that any other nation or religion have done.

Kohat Pakistan
If all of the Muslim world attacks Israel or just gives the threat to do so then see how painful this for America, the God Father of Israel.
Then a true seize fire will be observed.
But what should we do about the cowardice of Muslim rulers.
Someone should ask the Ahmadi Nejad to be the first to attack as he is popular for his bravery.
Struggle for Peace and human rights is not the solo responsibility of Arabs or the Muslim world. It is the duty of the whole world to raise their voices against cruelty.
This sad incident is the worst crime committed by Bush.
In India and Pakistan, the financial corruption becomes higher at the end of fiscal year. Similarly, The Bush administration has permitted that Israel can do what they want.
On one hand America demands the seize fire
On the other hand, the United Nations is passing resolution after resolution but action-wise neither have done anything. There is only one meaning of this, and that is that even the United Nations is openly in favor of destroying the Muslims.
All Muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the United Nations, and should establish their own global organization.
We have many examples of where promises and resolutions of only America and the United Nations are seen, and harm is done to the Muslims.
What is the use of these vain efforts if BBC does not want to publish anything?
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically that of Muslims, is spilled the monster of unbiasedness gets onto the BBC's back.
which considers itself the standard bearer of truth.
Forget about breaking something on its own - the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments.
from Muslims
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, and the likes of you stay among Muslims, and call yourselves Muslims.
[syja786]
For a long time on BBC forums, sometimes suicide bombing and terrorism in India was used to target a certain sect.
The favorite word of these Anti-Islamic discussions was "Extremism".
You can get a very good idea about who an extremist is from the above discussion, where writing against Iran was almost considered blasphemy.
When will our muslims understand that Anti Christ can not be fought with swords?
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what can one do other than cry?
But the basic fault is that by naming the source of this turmoil and massacre Jihad, we try to blacken the beautiful face of Islam.
When the majority of Palestinians accepted the existence of Israel, then why did Hammas need to fire those rockets on Israel and conduct suicide attacks?
The attitude of the both the sides is against humanity.
The role of UN and the USA was again seen as favoring towards the injustice of Israel.
May Allah give the muslim nation the understanding of becoming united. Amen!
As a matter of fact,think about giving Noble Prise to terrorists for carrying out this painful terrorist activity, as a campaign against terrorism, eventually the actual work is being done by them.
Otherwise, is it possible to carry out terrorist activity on such a massive scale without the assistance of Chiefs,when everyone knows who are pulling their strings.
In such a situation it appears to be high handedness,"Do what ever you can."
The strong mans fist,it beats over the head and do not let one cry.
The Arab rulers are giving medicine for the injured,funeral clothing for the dead as well as money, and they are asking
why the Israelis are continuing their attacks?
The actual problem is that the rulers of Islamic countries, including Saudi Arabia, do not have the military power or an effective defense plan.They just think that by providing aid they have done their duty.
They should immediately take practical steps against Israel
such as cutting the oil supply to European countries and America.
Regards to all brothers and sisters.
I think, asking Hamas to give up their struggle for the sake of peace is unfair to millions of widows and orphans. It is similar to prove them unsuccessful.
If the  Pharaoh-ism of US and Israel is on rise then Moses will come to counter them because every Pharaoh has a Moses.The American and Israelis actions are producing suicide bombers among Muslims.
Power has abandoned their ability to think and understand.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan.
Now Hamas and Israel should seize fire to stop bloodshed.
Mohammad Sarfraz, Paris, France.
Rightly said.
Suppose Hamas is on right path and struggling against cruelty for the sake of God's will, they should know that an act of goodness does not remain good if it causes harms to others.
Love for humanity is the precondition for God and his prophet's love.
It seems God has asked to completly obliterate all others than Muslims.
Najeeb-ur-Rahman Psycho *Lahore* [Pakian]
No! It is not decreed to annihilate but it is decreed to invite people to Islam.
People who perform conspiracies against the religion think it is decreed to do Jihad against them.
One should fight with them until they finish one's conspiracies. However, this certainly does not mean that they can wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
The consequence of a murderer of children is disaster.
Its a request to my friends that yesterday Israelis did not have a roof over their heads yet today they are so strong that they do not listen to anyone because all Jews are one.
They do not have Shiite nor Sunni, all are just Jews and they have succeeded in every field and made everything.
What is the condition of 55 Islamic Countries?
Lagging in every field and now the condition is this that they are so helpless that enemies are killing them and they are waiting for their death.
All Muslim countries should get together and make a plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better action plan than this, which is to accept Israel and to learn modern science and developmental ways from them and allow the world to live in peace and calm.
Muslims have a lot of land and resources.
The need is for proper utilisation.
First, the part that hurts the most is that there could not be unity between Hamas and Al-Fath.
Great leader like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were systematically killed to weaken the brave nation of the only region which is still fighting for Masjid Aqsa, and this was not possible as long as Yasin and Arafat were in the way.
The world is watching how Palestine is getting scattered, second by second, after the death of these two leaders.
And how the Jewish lobby is increasing its reach, second by second.
In 1974, Pakistan had a Prime Minister of such global credentials that for the first time in the history of the country, he gathered all the Muslims leaders, with a 100% attendance, under a single roof.
Today on his 81st birth anniversary, is it a very difficult task for the people to pledge to keep unity, not only within their ranks,
Also, while eradicating the differences between other Muslims, Islamic common wealth will be compiled.
It's a monster that has gripped Palestine for half a century.
This monster has many faces.
Many times this monster criticizes itself from a different mouth, to divert the attention of the world.
Its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This monster is most unhappy with Islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through Islam, and the history of Practical Islam that Islam has put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
Bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since the 27th of December.
More than 300 Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
After the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
Through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the Security Council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to effect a ceasefire.
However, Israeli officials claim that they will continue their action in Gaza until they are convinced that Israel will be safe from rocket attacks.
In your opinion, is the statement by Israel, that this is an Israeli struggle for safety, acceptable?
In this situation, is the global brotherhood doing its' job?
Can this inhumane action have a direct relation with the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can there be any expectation of improvement in the Middle East situation, after newly-elected president Barack Obama takes office?

Zaheer Chughtai
In this art, now-a-days the Pakistani electronic and print media, specially some Urdu newspapers and columnists are not behind anyone, who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism for the ""Grudge of Muavia"" written on them.
It is said, that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hammas should stop the attacks. How long this hypocrisy will continue?
Why is so much oppression being done on the Muslims? If country like America stop supporting these Jews, then Allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support, and then see what kind of life they get.
The famous unjust people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.
In the words of a poet
Oppression is oppression, that the more it's done the more it is erased.
Blood is blood, that the more it falls, the more it gathers.
Now who can tell that who did terrorism?
Is all this not included in terrorism? Why does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocent not red?
And why is there no one to send a mourning message from anywhere?
I saw bombings like this in Bombay. My own house caught fire. Can these people not see the sorrow they cause? Can no one see this sorrow? Alas, if only Muslims would think as one.
There were dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces were soaked in blood. How shall we voice our condemnation? I can not find words!
I feel like crying because of the helplessness of Muslims that on one side people are being killed in India so the rest of the world comes over Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations otherwise we will do it ourselves!
On the other hand, Israel is killing generations of Muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent. This is unbearable!
There is delay but not EVER in the house of God and only then will this darkness be gone.
When America backs Israel, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Concerning elections, the rulers should do such things to gain people's support. There is no doubt about this especially when countries like Israel exist. Stop talking about Barrack Obama. History is a witness that no American leader has gone against this policy. They will not do it. A regime, whether black or white, is a regime.
The debate going on in this forum makes it clear that every one is sad about Benazir's death. As a politician, though, one can not ignore her mistakes.
This discussion should include debate about whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was so dear then why was it suppressed in the 10 year dictatorship of Musharaf until American influence brought it back?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when people affected by dictatorship needed her. Unfortunately she came to Pakistan when assured from the government that she will be freed from trials.
There is no one remaining to say anything about the criticism and accusations of a historical personality.

Somethings should be ignored because nothing can be done about them.

How bloody is our nation and in our party's excitement while writing the Epode they will be blind. But now every historic people is trying to pinpoint an accusation and criticize the judiciary, but on this noone is telling anything.
We have achieved a lot of success.
Sana Khan
Few things can be avoided by thinking that nothing can be done. This is the same as if we put books on donkey -- he will not become a professor.
If after the attack on Mumbai there is a problem between Pakistan and India, they still have to continue their regular activities.
If we talk about war then on both sides there will be a loss of human life.
India is saying that the person arrested at the time of the Mumbai attack is a Pakistan citizen and he has written a letter in Urdu and sent it to Pakistan. But India has said after arresting him that he is an engineer, but after that they have proved that he is just a fourth standard pass, a point to be observed.
First of all, to Mr. Bhana and all Western friends of this forum, a happy Christmas.
Colleagues of the forum: Mr psycho, a raza, sister sana, sister shahedah akram and to all Adaab (salaam, greeting)
We do not want the flames of war. We want the flowers of peace.
War is, in itself, a problem.
What problems can war solve?
It will give fire and blood today.
It will give hunger and need tomorrow.
Therefore, intelligent people,
If war keeps getting postponed, it's better.
On your and our porch,
If the candle keeps burning, it's better.
Indo-American relations have now gotten quite deep, and India knows with certainty that America will openly betray Pakistan when the time comes.
This is also the old history of America.
If an Indian attack occurs, America would achieve its goals at the expense of India.
Pakistan should make it known very clearly that we shall never attack India first, but if we are invaded there will never again be any peace, reconciliation or ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied. Even if it means we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
This is the Islamic history.
Even before this resolution the Pakistani public and army had already given the message that they wanted to establish.
Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it more easier for them than expected. The world community has relaxed its pressure now in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has shown.
While ignoring India's unnecessary bribery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a ""Side Effect"" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
There are not even two people that will say that this is not a heinous act.
The real question is, when thousands of the Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at the time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they've done over the past year?
How many Taliban were killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday?
I appealed to the I.S.I that please stop monitoring the Taliban, and let us live in peace in our heavenly hometown, Sawat.
Stop this phony operation.
That day is not far when a resolution about Pakistan's military intervention will be passed by United Nations just like the bill which was passed against Jamat-ud-Dawah.
Riaz Ahmad Farooqi
The extremists of our country and their supporters themselves are constantly providing all evidences and justifications required for instigation of action against them. If the day comes when such a resolution is passed, most likely not a single voice would be raised in United Nations in our favour.
Supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.
We are not aware and familiar with the character and achievements of Pir Sami-ullah, and what his activities were.
He may not have been a revolutionist.
Like the dead bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, Doctor Najeebullah and thousands of other revolutionists have been subjected to dishonour at the hands of the enemy.
They are immortal even after they die.
There is an international game being played here, in which the public is ruled by fear through barbarism and ferociousness.
The license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will seize the government.
These acts of so-called Islamic "activists" in the name of religion is without doubt worthy of condemnation.
These supporters of extremists can see the injustice of America, but instead of expressing grievance about those dishonest acts they clearly shun them by giving them the name of tribal traditions.
Even by calling it "tribal traditions", and sometimes in the name of Islam, any pious man will still fail to give reason for such dishonest acts.
In my view, our Army people are associated with these people.
When these people move from a place then it takes time before they can be caught. There should be time for that, but it's a stretch that they will get there on time before they are long gone.
Are they so merciless that they kidnap fifty or seventy men and our Army applauds at them like a spectator?
They are servants of Allah and so is the Army.
There is something wrong at the bottom.
Malaiat, in the period of the dictator of the time, Zia-u-Lhaq, he did not show good characteristics of sympathies of Allah, but there are various tortures in the name of religion and more it his writing, "What will be done after death."
Such persons use this fright as a way to get only this world respect.
O Speakers                                                                                                                                                              ""preachers""
You frightened the world in the form of fire of Hell.
You became the image of fright.
Upon it, I wondered that when it is said if it can be a Muslim action.
We do not know this history or cover it for any purpose.


Was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina the act of Christians and not the Jews?
Without accepting reality, the motives can not be diminished nor correction can be made.
BBC, please stop this dual-headed policy.
Better than this topic is the super hit title "Shoeing of Bush - Fair or Unfair"?
It should have been.
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
Please show some modesty. A human was pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office?
The success of Operation Sherdil, and across the border, Operation Lion Heart, depends on whose favor the opinion of general public is in.
This act is of American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahab is a victim of this conspiracy.
All discussions on this forum will now be anti-Taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined Taliban and they are doing what they can to change the public opinion.
I would like to ask only this. What were the soldiers doing when the corpse was kept hanging throughout the day? Were they sitting there to aim only at the common people? It is said that Taliban hideouts were bombed and a woman and two kids were killed when a house was attacked.
Why didn't they come to know about this great tragedy?
Were they leisurely having fun?
Let us fold our hands to you in a request. For God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler who watches over all of us.
Though the question raised from the B.B.C. is substandard, it could only be felt pity at the poor quality of the writers. For instance, nobody asked this. What were the 3000 soldiers camping at Swat doing?
The army's helpers were hanging the dead bodies of those who fought the Taliban on poles.
The cheating done to the commoners by the Pakistani soldiers is done, but it is not right that the medias including B.B.C. has concealed the fact from the world.
The Pakistani soldiers are playing drama.
Every child in Swat whispers that it is a bloody drama.
Stop this drama for Godsake!
These Talibans have destroyed the image of Muslims.
If the real Muslims do not accept Taliban as Muslims, then why do they get a refuge in thier places?
The ones who are shameless and do not do hardwork and labour take arms in their hands and join thier group.
Islam doesn't spread through sword and guns.
Have shame.
It's baseless has no roots in any religion nor in family customs.
All media including BBC show different views on Taliban and Tribals.
Infact nobody knows the actual situation except us, becuase we are the natives.
(sorry was pretty hard to translate)
This move has shamed all the Muslims.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is the Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that current leadership will end this  cancer.
After the Mumbai attacks, India said that some extremists were behind the attacks.
Pakistan, rejecting the accusations, said that it will help India's investigation in every possible way.
India said that it has given a list to Pakistan of 20 suspected extremists wanted by India.
Now Pakistan has said that included in the list is Jaish-e-Muhammad's Molana Azhar Masood, who is not in custody and about whom the government of Pakistan has no information.
Before that Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari refuted the view that the West's secret agencies and the Indian government has given evidence related to the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari has said that it has not been proven that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that its relations with India are not going to improve until its land is ceased to be used for terrorism.
In latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should sports be effected due to recent political events?
What future to you see for India-Pakistan relations?
Neither America nor India broke Pakistan.
Pakistan was broken by the Pakistanis themselves.
What else could be expected after such regionalism, communalism and vandalism.
Even Jinnah did not do good for the Muslims of India. Time has proved this.
Yasmin, Chicago
If we had kept working on the vision of Jinnah, destroying the cancer of communalism, then regionalism and vandalism would not have spread in Pakistan, and the Muslims of India would not have been treated poorly.
It is our mistake that we have not produced a leader of his caliber.
If we could pay the respect that is due to our heroes..
This region has great potential.
God knows when this region will learn it's lesson and it's unity will bring regional development/prosperity.
Both countries have extremist forces like Taliban, Shiv Sena and RSS etc... These extremist forces are enemies of regional peace.
The imperial powers do not want peace and stability in this region.They are controlling these countries like puppets.
Can you imagine the international influence of Pakistan, China and India, if they are united?
Pakistan is under the occupation of corrupt and opportunist leadership.
May God protect our country, Pakistan.
But being a Pakistani we should not neglect the ground realities/threats. American forces have been deployed very near to our Afghan borders.
In spite of this, the situation in the country doesn't seem to be stable. The situations with the NWFP, Baluchistan and Sindh, and the problems in Karachi are also evident.
In troubled times like this, we need a leader that can unite the people of this country.
O God, please show us some mercy.
I believe we have no other option but to go to war one last time.
Enough is enough.
It's now or never.
These fraudulent dialogues and pointless meetings are not the solution to the problem.
Neither is committing small scale terrorist acts against one another.
After all, it was only after waging the Second World War that Europe managed to sort its problems out.
Were it not for this World War, they'd still be arguing and nagging at each other over small things.
Almost all of our political parties are unified on the idea that terrorism and sectarian violence need to be eradicated from the country.
But our own military leadership does not seem to be sincere on the topic. On one side, Europe and America have assured that the military is sincere in achieving a terror free state, yet on the other hand they help the Taliban in disguise.
Now we have to think and define our path and select one to focus on. Thank you.
There is no doubt that the elements of Jamat-ud-dawa include a majority of people who belong to Lashkar-e-Taiba, a banned organization, which is now established and operating with a new name in Pakistan.
However, after more focus was diverted towards humanitarian efforts, as well as India's strong request, the United Nations has banned the organization and the government of Pakistan has implemented a crack down as well.
In my opinion, if these Jihadi groups would leave religious extremism and focus on religion and humanitarian assistance, it would be much better.
The terrorist organizations in Pakistan that have used the name of Jihad to induct and nurture professional killers, criminals and their molana's are the same people who called Pakistan "Plaeedistan" meaning "unclean land." These are the people that give Pakistan a bad name.
Now, they are trying their best to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they aren't even close to being a Muslim. In fact, they deserve to be called animals or barbarians.
Pakistani security will remain at risk until these extremists are eradicated from the country.
Should we still think that the innocent people will be charged under rules and regulations?
In this furious world, the job is war, and their work is only to kill.
With this news, my heart is broken.
What type of world is this in which  it is very difficult to follow and live within the preachings of Allah's Islam .
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims, but when the Muslims try to take revenge, then all non-Muslims--together with the whole world--think that the Islamic preachings are what Hafiz Sayeed is doing.
India is very upset about the attack on Mumbai.
Citizens of Pakistan have created the misunderstanding between two countries, and in the coming days the sitiuation will be worse.
India always blames the Pakistani terror group.
The coming problems with the taluk have been stoped.
The Indian security centers have blamed them for the attack on Mumbai, saying the Lashkar-e-tayab is responsible.
In this case, the name of Jamat-ud-Dawa has come in the front many times.
This is the first time that relation between both countries have worsened due to a terrorist activity in India
In December 2001, after the attacks on Indian Parliament, these two neighbors were on the brink of war.
After that, in 2002, Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
Now Jamat-ud-Dawa, about which Security analysts say that  in reality is a new face of Lashker-e-Tayyaba. Restrictions on the party are being requested.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan do decisive operations against extreme activists on its land?
By banning Jamat-ud-Dawa, can  current Pak-India crisis be over?
Can the crisis be over? And how important is it to close down the armed groups to keep constant peace between both countries?
Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all, what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly?
Will the Peace Council never show any alertness against the Muslims?
It is said that when the accuser is lazy the witness is active.
India itself has become one useless realm.
Whose intelligence, army and other security officials have become useless.  For 72 hours they have danced the dance of mole with terrorists and India is cheating the world by blaming Pakistan over its uselessness.
If one disbeliever dies then the whole world knows about it - why is this doubly accurate?
To the dear nation of one nonpolitical, religious, farming organization:
Farhan Farooq, Faisalabad
When our Prophet (Peace be upon Him), great ancestors, and Sufism gave the human beings their love and respect, the religion Islam was growing more vast and ripening from peace.
The Muslims were also promoted in every field.
But when this beautiful Religion fell into the hands of government, human beings began to differentiate into the religious and the disbelievers, and the new gateways of pride and prejudice began to be known for the first time in the world.
Salute, Sir salute happily, but get your work done on your own.
Do not do it under the pressure from America.
If India is in difficulty, let them prove it, ok?
Why does it not give?
And why do they accuse us with everything?
There are fundamentalist groups and organisations, even in India. Why does no one put any restrictions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the whole world?
What is it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What is it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the first Islamic Nuclear State. What the fight is about?
Pakistan is on the verge of break up.
Kamranhassan, ABU DHABI
You are right, circumstances do support your argument.
Now, even American magazines are publishing new maps of Pakistan. These sanctions are part of the greater game plan.
Gradually,USA is making its grip stronger on Pakistan.
In this situation, if we had not become a united nation then history of Bangladesh's creation would be repeated.
Terrorists attacks should be condemned, whether these are committed in Mumbai, Islamabad or in Philistine.
Terrorists should be uprooted without any discrimination of nationality.
The question arises, why has Pakistan and the rest of the world been silent on the terror attacks in Pakistan, killing hundreds of innocent people?
if attack on Marriott was not act of terror?
then why
Hale to the advisor for interior Rehman Malik! How brave and bold has the gentleman become!
no image
not only this, but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under 'someones's pressure'.
Wow, all praise to the Almighty!
Whether having the ability or not or to say what I do not want.
We, the Pakistanis are fighting who's war?
We have our own interests that we shall do our best to protect.
No one has  a right to interfere with anyone's national affairs.
The colonial system is apparently not there.
If people demanded justice and the Allied forces recognized the importance of a free judiciary, respected democratic institutions, and didnt support dictatorial governments, peace could be achieved in third world countries, including Pakistan. However, this is not acceptable for the Allied forces.
Pakistan is always in line with European and American interests.
Pakistan is forced to be so, despite the opposition from the majority of its populace.
This enhances the opposition viewpoint and anti-American sentiment.
If America and its allies truly believe in democracy, they should give up their colonial behavior and leave this region.
Pakistan has the ability to arm or disarm itself.
Security forces searched a camp of Lashar-i-tayba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
After the Mumbai attacks, pressure is being increased on Pakistan to take actions against extremist groups.
India has claimed that the group based in Lashar-i-tayba had a role in the Mumbai attacks.
Condalezza Rice, the American secretary of state, asked Pakistani leadership to take practical and transparent actions against those responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
he believed the terrorists involved in Mumbai Attacks were from the Pakistani soil.
Meanwhile, the officials in Peshawar has told that more than 50 trucks have been burnt by some unknown armed persons. These trucks were going to Afghanistan with goods for NATO forces.
This was the second attack on American supply during the last 48 hours.
Meanwhile Pakistani police cracked down a camp of Lashkar i Taiba, a banned outfit. Already many efforts have been made to disarmed the extremists, even money and indemnity was offered.
It is clear from the circumstances that efforts remain unsuccessful to dislodge the armed groups funded by Americans and Saudis during afghan war. It means efforts to restore Pre-80's Pakistan are fruitless.
Question arises, whether Pakistan wants to do so?
If Pakistan has an ability to do this?
What is your opinion?

I have only one question for the standard bearers of the world.
If you kill their children, will they come to give you garlands? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill innocent people, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in negative, then you really need to fix your viewpoint.
The people were armed when there was the fear that Russia would head towards Pakistan after finishing Afghanistan, and that is why they were supplied with arms.
Now, when there is the fear that America will capture Pakistan, via Afghanistan, as the present American president has clearly mentioned in his presidential mission, why should we disarm them now?
Only such that after defeating the American or Indian army it does not have to face any resistance from the public?
Yes, if any of them are guilty of being involved in any destructive work, Pakistan can take action against them alone.
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
Another question is: were these terrorists not supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the present terrorism is in no way connected to it.
It must be remembered that Hafiz Saeed is the first 'Jehadi leader' who called the Taliban actions 'mischief'.
I am sure the Taliban effect is a inseparable result of American plans, and hence every person who can stand in the way of Taliban must be removed.
Despite the support of the whole nation, the fact that Zardari took action against the Lashkar is a clear sign of frigid and sycophant nature.
To stop the project that is running on Saudi-American funding, they must be requested themselves to regather, for God's sake, the filth that has polluted our society.
we will protest against them that in which ethical way America and Saudia has distributed dangerous weapons and so called Jihad but actually they have distributed hatred literature and cultural virus which has created a human slaughter houses.
after the threat from India to attack Pakistan, Pakistan Military announces that they will pull his forces from Afghan border and put it towards India. Taliban also announces that they will take care of the Afghan border which resulted in a chaos in America and he Forced India not to do war with Pakistan.
In this Letter all the musket of American Power was exposed
in contrast India has never threatened nor has the power to attack
the remaining damage is done by the Taliban by attacking the American convoy
this proved that without Pakistan Military and Government Of Pakistan support America is nothing
Karachi, Pakistan's Main Business and Finance City which is Dubai of all the rural areas
Million never returned from here with empty hands, but when western areas law and order situation is worsen all attention is directed towards Karachi
now they want to hijack this city
for the first time Pathans are called by Pakhtuns, which is making city's people as stranger and fighting among each other but to be united is necessity of time
One solution to this problem is that either the Urdu speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun speaking people learn Urdu, or both learn English.
You might think that this is a funny proposal, but does this cause of conflict seem funny?
That the cause of this extremism is language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, I actually shared this proposal many times with friends during my childhood, which included people from different religious and linguistic groups, but these people used to laugh at me.
At that time, the religious and linguistic hate, which was not as lively and strong as it is today, were still developing within.
How come I can never understand what is happening?
Are these the signs that the Day of Judgment is coming?
For what crimes are innocent people being killed?
The reasons are in front of everybody. Those who want to break up Pakistan are the active ones, whom have neither religion, nor country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns.
Whichever government comes, it will only changesthe names of the places and start working for fame. This is just like nowadays. The airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir describe what is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
At the height of the Mumbai attacks, the fact that the efforts to cause mischief on linguistic and racial lines in Karachi failed is proof that those politicians have been resigned from their jobs.
The taking of the lives of innocent Pushtu speaking labourers and the Indian warnings have awakened sleeping Pakistani feelings from Karachi to Khyber.
The identical country, loving reaction of all the political, religious, linguistic and national parties has not only taught India the manners of diplomacy, but it has also given the American policy makers a chance to think again.
The responsible parties for the worsening situation in Karachi are the United and the ANP. The government is taking sides.
The government could control the situation in one hour, but it is purposely allowing it to grow.
The police and rangers are avoiding action because of the pressure on them by political parties.
The talk of uniting is restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
These kinds of situations will happen until political pressure stays on the management. Allah keep Pakistan safe.
In my opinion, they are the biggest terrorists.
Of course there are external powers active in this, but no one knows who they are?
But what is the most unfortunate is if this kind of situation occurred in a city like Sarhad, the government would have acted, but because it is not in Sarhad, the government is so behaving helplessly.
Government should do an operation here and save country's big and an important city.
Otherwise, Pakistan will face a large economic setback.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth because they are scared. On the other hand Pakistan's media's condition is even worse.
The complete truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is this that Urdu speaking people should learn Pashto or Pashto speaking people should learn Urdu. It would be even better if everyone learned English.
You will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but don't you think the reason for collision is ridiculous?
The reason for persecution may be language.
Another story of murder has finally been published in Karachi, which was being dreaded by all the citizens for a long time.
The criminals do not let go any opputunity of a crime. The news reports and the media are only telling 50% of what actually happened here in 4 days.
We have spent the last three nights without sleeping and the fear is still there.
Those who make the people evacuate hotels, those who kill the shoe-makers and the peanut-sellers.
Those who rob and kill at the Super Highway, and cut off the ears of innocent citizens, they are ignorant of the wrath of Allah which will eventually entrap them.
What could be the reasons of this sudden turmoil in your opinion?
(B.B.C)
Keeping in view, the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai, we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in Karachi. It is simple and easy to guess that the turmoil is just due to an unconcious trade of blood.
Obviously if somebody infuriates a father, it would not be surprising if the son reacts violently.
the blood of the loyalists of Liaqat Ali Khan also belonged to the same place but to eliminate Mr. Psycho's misunderstanding I am writing this verse.
We shall also continue the traditions of our elders.
It was made by the sacrificing of lives.
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
It is very disappointing that the fate of the entire country is at stake and we are still fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
Liaqat Ali Khan belonged to a noble Punjabi family from Karnal in Punjab.
Due to his efforts on behalf of migrants, they now consider him as one of their own.
For every action there is always a reaction.
one can afford on oneself but.
Ejaz Aiwan
Before you gather a huge crowd quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan. They did not face any reaction.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
One Muslim League N was left. Even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to the People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q have made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment to the National Assembly and the Senate.
Till now, it seems that the drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment. They also did not force the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part. They will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft and that the government speaker did not take any action.
MQM the government, Muslim League N in the opposition and Muslim League Q was the party who passed 17th amendment, so how is it possible that these parties will be sincere in finishing the 17th amendment.
This is what is called getting credit for nothing.
People's party is already not in a hurry to finish 17th amendment.
How can someone think of cutting their own hands?
The 17th amendment will not be canceled until Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of the majority in our survey, and it is also true.
If 17th amendment was to be discarded, then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf. Because with being the president, he is also the chairman of the People's Party.
The 17th amendment is valid until he is the president.
In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to bid Zardari farewell from the president house.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
Most of the elders in our family belong to the labor class.
During your childhood, when our uncles were doing their work, we prayed for Allah to protect us from physical labor.
To avoid this, we wrote to the editor of monthly Amroz to ask him what to do after matriculation so that we would not have to do physical labor.
The editor wrote in reply that we should become a doctor or engineer and study these courses.
We were inclined towards engineering and in matriculation, we studied technical drawings instead of biology.
But at the time of admissions in FSc, the elder brother forced us to study medical in FSc.
We hardly studied biology for a month before we started studying math.
These were the means that we took to avoid physical labour. We became engineers and we are in better position than many members of our family and we thank Allah for it.
We remembered this when with out our 2 young sons. We were trying to lift carpets of old hour.
It had been not even half an hour that we were working when the small son said, "Daddy, it seems that I am not born for this job."
We said, if so, study well like us and build up your body.
The son started saying, "I am studying already, will be studying more, but this work is not done by me."
Any we three managed to complete the work within three hours and returned home.
The meaning of saying this is that if a man decides on one destiny then whatever comes afterward will not stop him from accomplishing his destiny.
Yes, and if you don't really know what you have to do, then Allah is the only protector for you.
There is a saying that we should never speak ill of the dead, but what to do, when at the first anniversary of Benazir's death, we only see bad in her.
Benazir for her own benefit forwarded to India the Sikhs' army, who were to fight the war of independence. On one side the independent movement of the Sikhs was collapsed and on the other side gave an opportunity for India to concentrate on Kashmir after pushing down the Punjab movement.
It is part of the distraction from the leadership of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif which have pushed the country many years backwards.
During exile, Benazir continued on keeping the series beneficiary information of Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
During her rule, Benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make money. That is why he is known as "Mr. Ten Percent".
During Benazir's rule his brother got killed, but his murderers are still safe from any punishment.
Although she was a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
Just as Benazir conducted her politics over her father's dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came into power twice, but she could not punish the culprits of her father's political murder. Even she couldn't register a case against them.
It has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us, but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
What should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated December 16 as a didactic day and take measures to ensure that this kind of incident doesn't happen again.
On this day, we can send greetings to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again.
The rulers would reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Bahari's stuck in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines.
If only East and West Pakistan could be one together just like East and West Germany was united once again.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be granted in the near future.
It was announced today that the governor of Illinois was arrested on corruption charges.
When the state Congress started getting ready to remove him from the position of the governor as soon as possible, then there is this one American companion who has a close watch on the circumstances of Pakistan, boastfully claimed to us that this is what we call democracy.
In America, even the higher level people can not transcend the law.
The other is your country, Pakistan, where even the President was chosen after the corruption charges against him were dropped.
My vein of loyalty throbbed and I said what is the big deal if a governor was arrested in America. In our Pakistan, once the Prime Minister was arrested and hanged overnight, and another time sent into exile.
Tell me, when did this happen in America?
In Pakistan, those who broke the law were sent out of the presidential palace with a guard of honor. Tell me when this happened in America.
The Chief Justice of Pakistan was removed in such a manner, that despite having public support, he could not be replaced until now. Has this happened in America?
In Pakistan, a fake-degree holder was made the Minister of Health. Did this happen in America?
Hearing this, the American laughed until he was tired and accepted defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded on all four sides by Americans.
It seems from his smile that.
he thinks America is with his government. He is forgetting that one year ago, they were with Pervez Musharraf.
Thus, psychotherapy gained popularity.
Whether there is madness in method or method in madness, there is certainly a method in dealing with madness.
That said, mental health care has come a long way from merely addressing dementia to dealing with problems such as stress, depression, anxiety, and relationship issues.
She completed her MA in counseling psychology from Columbia university.
The center offers support services for depression, anxiety, stress, learning disorders, and personality deficiencies.
Material problems and workplace issues also exist.
It also offers employee assistance programs for members.
There are plenty of opportunities in the fields of counseling and psychotherapy.
Traditionally both roles were played by psychiatrists, who not only counseled patients, but prescribed them drugs.
Recent research has revealed that there are conditions which can be cured without medication.
Instead of using military power, the government should find out the real causes of the problem.
Fazalullah and the Taliban will dissolve into nothingness if their root causes are terminated.
The Shariat bill suggested by the                                                                 The Shariat bill suggested by the ANP administration will, to a great extent, bring a solution for the problems in Swat.              a
But, in addition to the observance of Sharia law, the administration will take care of the well-being of the people.
The actions of General Musharraf made us believe that we had been made free from the unqualified politicians of the land. However, his ambition for power changed everything.
How high expectations there were! He lost all hopes in ""war and terror"".
Hopes of taking actions were lost.
It seemed he understood that the end of his reign was imminent along with the end of Bush administration. As a result, thieves were recruited to power centers.
General Musharraf was in a position to control the army, but the present administration doesn't know what is happening.
The army could not put down the terror in Baajodoh and Swat. The commoners are subjected to "bombardments and enmity", creating great loss to lives and properties, and launching them into psychological disorder.
The situation is still going from bad to worse in Swat, a strongly affected part of Sarhad state, despite the continuity of military action for over one year.
On one hand, the government is reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly. On the other hand, the Taliban's illegal radio FM channel is having much more influence in the region.
In the most pragmatic point of view, the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region.
During the attacks by security forces there were claims the fundamentalists were destroyed bombing from gun ship helicopters and cannon houses. Despite this damage, the Taliban only became more powerful. According to one estimation, their control over Swat increased that much more.
On the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat, but on the other hand the Taliban is stronger.
Who is stuck in  between? The unfortunate civilians are.
It is said that in Swat someone asked what kind of people are the Taliban were. The questioner received the answer, "They are very good, as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of Allah and the religion."
Then he asked how the army was and received the answer, "They are very good, as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country."
Finally, he asked who the enemies of the religion and the country were. He received the answer, "We civilians are."
I am wondering how the Pakistani Army will fight the Indian Army, when they couldn't succeed against a small faction of the Taliban.
They could not track down Taliban's illegally operated FM channel, which in my opinion is very easy.
But still, FM was spreading hatred in full swing.
Girls' schools as well as boys' schools are now being destroyed.
A curfew is imposed so that Talibans can move around easily.
Tonight 8 trucks entered the suburbs of Mingora during curfew and created bunkers.
The question is, how could they reach it during curfew?
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house and salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, someone tell this army to protect the helpless people of Sawat from the Taliban and prove that the Pakistan army can overcome any enemy.
He says that most of the blood is spilled in the name of religion. Tell me, if there was no religion, would blood not have spilled?
Punjabi, Pathan, White and Blank, Mehsood and other tribes: Are these the products of religion?
No not at all.  A religion teaches that there is no white, no black.  There is no Punjabi, no immigrant.  If there was no religion, then people would have destroyed each other and other things in the battle of black and white.
The religion only teaches the man how to be disciplined and mannered.  Religion only shows the man that he has not come by himself.  Instead he has been created by the Supreme Power God and He has sent you in this world to lead a life as per His orders.
Being a Muslim, I am very sure that Islam is a complete religion  and moreover it is a true religion.
Even after the time I acquired the luxuries in London, I continued to call up my relatives every morning to find out about their good and bad.  Even though my relatives never bothered to call me ever in my life. But still I continued to do so. But the time when I felt that my relatives don't even like me calling them, I stopped making calls to them.
Even I have felt the same here since I have spent two years of my life in France.
Why do people still only  expect us to call them Patna?
About Iraq, within a few hours there would be an Army sent for the "peace" in the Darfar. This is not a problem for them.
The action after the Mumbai Blasts and the security in the area are a matter of few hours.
There are discussions and opinions on the matter that Mumbai is more of a risk to death than any other source.
Hey you, the Protectors and leaders of the Peaceful world, the life is being ended here only in the discussions.
is it really being waited to diminish.
so that any again no aggrieved could even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights.
when a father is running carrying his beloved sons dead body, even then do your hearts not ache?
If not, then you don't even deserve to be called a human being.
but you are a black mantle over the name of humanity.
This region has also been a homeland for Jews for centuries.
ideally these two nations should have lived in harmony but since their fates are in Western and Arab hands, so without their will, peace can not prevail in this region.
and now even Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
even if the Israeli operation stops temporarily, it will start again any moment after any incident.
BBC's own country has its interests related to America and Israel and this is why while taking cover of enlightened moderation, it has started a series of blogs or Jewism and doing a biased propaganda.
The BBC is completing a formality. Their goal and intent is only to gather well wishes.
I request the moderator to publish this comment from Fidwi: "So it be known that at least a little bit of affinity towards truth is still remaining in BBC".
Thank You.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to be known. But one thing is for sure, in every age, Dracula  has been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
This 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre is a surprise.
How could any one not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
What kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to any one coming in the next century ?

At this time, summer showers are taking place throughout the country, including Derah, Gahzi and Khan.
A poem on climate is presented to you. May you enjoy the sweet rain when you read this poem.
It rains just because of you.
Whenever it rains it is Spring.
Whatever comes to a standstill is tranquility.
Sometimes it comes, with no reason.
Often it spreads wide at night.
Often noisily, often silently.
It rains, but just because of you
Whatever cherishing memory, any night
A suppressed music!
Sometimes, he put it out.
Sometimes, he lit himself up.
Sometimes, every drop carries sorrow.
These rains are quite like you.
All these leaders are about to run holding a very sensitive case. Little do they care if the country survives or not.
The people should they sell their possessions or be wiping clean the temples with lemon peals.
Like our leaders, our media is corrupted as well.
Its sole purpose is to extract money from the government.
The people are oblivious about this.
An odd incident took place yesterday, at noon.
All the police are running here and there but no one is asking about illegal parking.
NYPD traffic was not in the state where it could look at illegally parked vehicles.
A plane of the US Air became a ship and landed in the Hudson river.
We only know that terrorists are of the descendants of geese.
Yesterday was perhaps historically cold in New York.
The temperature does not fall this much.
Even my jaws started hurting from my half an hour walk outside.
Imagine how the people who jumped from the plane into the river would have felt.
There was so much happiness that all the people were safe.
It was sad that the company's plane drowned during this financial crisis.
I went by West Side Highway to New Jersey. While watching all this, I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I still do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, in my one hour trip, the way had opened at least a bit so I was able to get the 56th street exit.
Otherwise, I would have not taken the previous two exits, seeing the lines waiting at them.

For no reason, we thought that the Taliban group from Sawat was non-religious, who were only against female education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
But like the majority of the ideas, this was not proven right either. According to this news on CNN, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a boys' school with gunpowder.
Swat: The Taliban has destroyed a boys' school.
The girls' schools were already destroyed, according to the famous English saying "Ladies First". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusations against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, says Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujaheddin more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Amen, then Amen.
Masha Allah, up till now, 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom, among Muslims, of fixing marriages before birth, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement made by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See a picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
Some days go, a girl's marriage with a dog become fresh.
I see that now.
Humanity is rare in the 21st century.
It is the age of the computer. The computer a place in every walk of life.
Many people have objections to the interference of computers in financial matters.
Although credit card users' personal lives are under more control of law enforcement agencies.
Now the record of financial matters can easily be tracked by using credit cards.
In the future, when usage of currency decreases, its importance will increase.
In the crime world, the risk is not taken to rob banks. Now credit card information is stolen.
Similarly friends are also made through computers.
Social networking sites, like Orkut, Facebook, and Myspace are at a high level of acceptance.
Do you think that the more we follow these social networking sites, we get farther away from people in real life?
The matchmaking websites, where you are shown a list of the people who match your desires, have a similar aspect.
Can you live happily with a person who is just like you?
I cannot, and I think that is why the spouse is called the better half.
He or she will help me address faults within me in a positive and productive manner.
Maybe I do have a little sense.
I used to believe older people were wise and believed everything they said.
Consequently, I thought that my father knew the answer to every question on earth.
People teased me a lot about that.
But only that saying seemed true which could be possible.
Become much irritation because what was the reason to tell lie?
Bore loss on that saying even at this age
So it is my effort to say lie the very least.
Do not misguide someone by lying and attaching Allah's name to said lie.
and Allah willing say only when there is pray to Allah that work completes.
Remaining Allah knows better the state of intention.
This is a disgusting problem that results from a distancing from religion.
According to the law of both Pakistan and our religion, minor children should remain with their mothers.
Their expense is due to their father and father can meet with children.
Then when the child becomes of age, he or she can stay with whomever they want.
You were right to mention that the actual problem is that the relatives were misleading.
Possessiveness is present in all our actions.
It is this very factor in effect over here, that there will be new shareholders in the father's property born, and they will go against him. Otherwise his fathers action is commendable.
These restrictions have caused social evils, even in our marriages.
The concept of the marriage of a divorced woman or a widow has become obscure.
It is these wasteful ideologies and baseless traditions that have made the family structure a mess.
Why is it In our society, if the spouse of a 50-55 year person passes away,  they not looked at in a nice manner?
Near us, there is a Pakistani uncle, whose wife passed away 10-12 years ago. Now, after marrying off all his children, he has married a widow, and his children have gone against him.
I believe this is his legitimate right. What do you think?
What kind of mentality believes 'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place?'
Would this mans children think poorly of him if he married a widow when hes already married off all his children?
By this means, the widow received support while the uncle hired someone to care for the house.
The children would have been busy with their own lives and would have been unable to care for him themselves.
Ignorance is the reason for all this.
If tomorrow their wives refuse to look after them, when they are old, what will they do?
This is the retaliation against the constraints of society.
Children start feeling ashamed of their fathers second marriage when judgmental people begin to question and mock their fathers choices.
In reality, they should face the oppositions and proclaim that their fathers actions is not wrong, but rather in perfect accordance with Islam.
For the last 40-50 years, our society has been forced to live with this curse.
A wife can accept her husband going around having illicit affairs, but she cannot stand him having a second wife.
If possible, stop him from doing so, even after death.
She destroys her husband and herself afterward, and becomes a means for spreading filth in society.
Chanting Islam, Islam does not mean anything. In reality, we like only our culture and traditions.
For instance, keeping girls from gaining an education and fearing marrying the girl of one's choice.
As for your question, the old man was going to the widow's house instead of bringing the widow to his house, so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax (though the stomach of the widow's children would hurt).
In the Indo-Pak subcontinent, Islam was accepted centuries ago, but it could not yet leave its' ignorant mentality and has always kept culture and tradition above Islam.
Thinking of a man's second marriage as an innovation, divorce as a clinical break, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as a mark of honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife, are all a part of this mentality.
What's more, imitating the western countries, we have started to consider piety and veils as old-fashioned.
Accepting Islam is easy, but leaving this mentality is very difficult.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Amen
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.

Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes, "I found this secret in my life that if the leader of any Army is in the front line, then that Army will never lose."
But here the situation is otherwise.
To say that common people are there to die for us, if we die then we are a martyr,
but, if someone from the common people dies then it is murder.

Today, as I was returning to my shop after Isha prayer, a man sitting in a car at the circle raised his hand and diverted my attention towards him.
I thought this man might have lost his way, or he might want to ask something, so I stopped, and his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked whether I could understand Arabic well or not. I said no problem, tell me what you want.
He started to say that I have come from Riyadh to Madinah, but someone has pick-pocketed me, so please help me out. I refused, as such an incident had taken place with me previously, that I had given the person 20 Riyals to buy petrol to reach Riyadh, but he went a little ahead and started to ask somebody else.
I got very angry and scolded him and warned him that I would call the soldiers, so he got very frightened.
Now the situation has become, that we Muslims come on cars, with our families to beg throughout the day and gain at least two or three thousand illegally.
Whereas there is a clear Hadith of the Prophet (SAWS) that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand; the lower hand being the begging hand and the upper hand being the giving one.
May Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims (Amen, Amen)

Famous singer Adnan Sami's wife reached a police station in Mumbai, accusing him of torturing her.
The police station advised her to contact a court.
Adnan Sami's wife, Saba Giladari, made a complaint against her husband saying that he continuously tortures her.
And she says that he treats her in a non-human manner.
Now it has become too difficult for her to bear, and that is why she has filed a case against him.
The police, instead of filing a case, told her to contact a court, saying that this matter was not one in which the police could get involved.
In your opinion, is the accusation against Adnan Sami by his wife proper?
This is not an Indian effort to disgrace Adnan Sami, is it?
Let us know about your opinion on this issue.
Adam Sanghad Mehr.
As far as making accusations, anyone can accuse the other.
To become enraged due to defending honor is not sensible.
Whatever be the case between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he had left his honorable life and went to India to earn money. Now that fame has fallen around his neck.
This is the result of his own actions.
Washington...
The Secretary of State of the United States of America, Hilary Clinton, says "President Obama will take a strong stand against Afghan President Hamid Karzai."
In America's new policy towards Afghanistan, war will be given more importance than economic developement.
The envoy to Afghanistan say that Hamid Karzai is considered a barrier to the achievement of American goals in Afghanistan. The corruption in the Afghanistan government and the business of middlemen has increased, and the Taliban are once more gathering strength.
The American envoy stated that among the people in the American government who are pressing President Hamid Karzai to do something more are, America's Vice President Joseph Biden and President Obama's representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Hallbrooke.
He said that this good administration was noticed after President Bush left, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai every 2 weeks, which used to emphasize the role of America in Afghanistan and the development of its city departments.
Officials say that the Obama administration will work with state leaders as a backup to the main government.
Officials say that they will emphasize to Hamid Karzai the importance of fighting against corruption.
Hamid Karzai faces new elections this year. It is not yet clear whether Obama and his administration will favor his re-election or not.
Is this statement of the American officials a forecast of change in America's policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is this era of Hamid Karzai ending?
What are your thoughts in this matter?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan with a score of 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka in the first day's match, but Sri Lanka won the next two matches.
In the third match, the nation's team performance was very poor. They scored only 75 runs in 23 overs against 309 runs made by the national team of Sri Lanka, and this is how we were defeated.
The result of the series proves that the National team has no consistency in its performance.
The national team was defeated. What are the reasons, in your opinion?
which departments of the game should be addressed more by the authorities?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
Which department will you blame for the defeat: fielding, batting or bowling?
Please provide your feedback.
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish traditions continue. These feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule, who would call them Muslims?
A Sardar should walk himself over these embers. Why doesn't the present government take action against them?
The judicial justice will come in handy.
The Sri Lankan cricket team has arrived in Karachi to play one day internationals.
Despite the tensions between Pakistan and India, it is nice to see a foreign team visit Pakistan.
Upon reaching the Karachi airport the Sri Lanka team was given a warm welcome.
There will be two one day matches in Karachi and one in Lahore between Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
There have been bold statements from both sides regarding their bowling, batting and fielding.
If the Srilankans are proud of their spinners, then Pakistan is sure to be proud of its fast bowlers.
The Sirilankan captain Mahela Jayawardene has said that no one player of the Pakistan team can be singled out as a threat, the whole team is dangerous.
Muralitharan and Mendis are said to be trump cards while the Pakistani captain has said that the competition will be a tough one.
Shoaib Malik said that they've already played Muralitharan and that they'll see off Mendis as well, he also said that they've got a secret game plan that they'll reveal on the pitch.
Can it really be that according to the Pakistani and Sirilankan claims the contest will be a gripping one?
Who will have the upper hand when the series between Pakistan and Sirilanka gets underway?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Give your opinion.
Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.

How is all this is double for these people, when the Kashmiri people have been fighting for independence for the last 60 years?
No, no one asked, and they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism, so they start talking about making up.
First they openly killed the Muslims, now they are making efforts to setting things right.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating such a situation so that the world's attention can be diverted from Kashmir.
But Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now the British Government is also understanding that the Indians are taking cover from their occupation over Kashmir by accusing Pakistan of terrorism.
They hesitate to talk to Pakistan about this issue.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that resolving the issue of Kashmir will bring an end to extremism, and the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
It should be clear that newly-elected American President Obama has also expressed similar views about the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister has written in an article and told the media that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of President Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
Due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Is India using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialogue?
Let us know your opinion.
Usman Aftab,
I think that the major powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
Rather, it wants to want to keep it in check, and hence is thinking of taking certain steps. They know that Pakistan is a nuclear state.
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries seem to think that if they corner Pakistan they will face political and geographic problems. They want to help Pakistan, but they also want to be successful in their goal.
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition that in the side is a knife, and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn Pakistan.
We are ready by all means. The Indian Army chief should keep his mouth shut.

Political statements are coming under the mischievous support of America. America is crazy and now Indians are going in the same pattern. If India has the courage to attack, it should to learn the reality.
Israel is attacking Hamas and no one has courage to stop Israel. Following Israel, India also wants to do some venture.
PM said that Byden had a great role in shedding Musharraf's uniform and restoring the democracy. That is why he has awarded SI.
No political party can get the credit of uniform shedding and the restoration of democracy. Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in Parliament.
PM said that Dr. Qadir's chapter had closed.
If public protest against dictatorship has no significance to you?.
If lawyers movement did not play any role?
What are you going to do about the Prime Minister's statement?
Please give us your opinion.
American President George W. Bush in his last press conference advises the newly elected president that he made many mistakes in his tenure and that Barack Obama should do whatever he think is right.
As the president and according to the Constitution of the USA and law I did these things, and I looked out for American interest at expense to my own popularity.
He said that America's enemies are still planning to attack America. The biggest challenge for Barack Obama is to prevent these attacks.
He said that being unable to find the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was his major dissapointment and that to announce the mission completed in Iraq was his biggest mistake.
In the last press conference from the White House, the American president has said, "This is my last press conference, and I thank all of you news reporters and my colleagues who attended this conference."
Do you think Obama will not make that same mistake that Bush made?
Don't you think Bush was late in accepting his mistakes?
Will Obama be able to follow the advice of Bush?
Inform us of your opinion.
The American Vice President Dick Cheney says, "I want to see Usama Bin Laden alive or dead."
He says that Usama Bin Laden is hiding in some hard to reach area and is of no use to his organization. However, if Usama Bin Laden is arrested alive or dead then his organization must be destroyed.
America is ambitious on the arrest of Usama and the search of Usama is on.
Will Dick Cheney's wish of arresting Usama be accomplished?
Inform us of your opinion.

We'd love to hear your opinions.
Again, Manmohan Singh is accusing Pakistan of creating a war-like atmosphere.
and that Pakistan is using terrorism as the policy of state.
While speaking to his cabinet of ministers, Manhmohan Singh reiterates that terrorist factions continue to have the support of their neighboring countries, particularly Pakistan.
Also, that the terrorists who attacked Mumbai used a naval passage in order to remain safe from the coast guard.
The Indian Prime Minister said that the Mumbai attacks of November were carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba.
He claims that the terrorists are using new techniques and modernized forms of communication. He asserts that we will have to gear up our forces at the line of control to match the opponents. He emphasizes that terrorism will not be tolerated by any means.
What is your take on this accusation by the Indian Prime Minister?
Do the internally opposed and separatist movements of India show the disturbed situation in India?
On whose orders is India taking this warning stance?
Give us your views.

This is a sad calamity that Israel is massacring the Palestinians and the same situation is prevalent in Kashmir, but there is no effect on the Security Council.
All the organizations present in Palestine and Kashmir should keep their war going until they gain independence, and they should form unity among themselves and keep facing any type of harm, and eventually their martyrdom will give fruit, God Willing.
The air attacks by Israel on Gaza are continuing just the same. Until now, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
Important Hamas leader Nazariyan was killed along with his wife and children.
Here the Security Council meeting concluded without any decision.
The meeting saw American opposition to the derogatory resolutions passed against Israel by Libya and other Arab countries.
Israel's jet planes have been bombarding the residential areas of Palestine for last several days.
Each country around the world began to protest against the Mumbai attacks but can no one see this brutality?
Why are the major Muslim countries quiet?
What is your opinion on these double standard of the world?
Saeed, New York.
In my opinion, the fact of the matter is that most of our people are uneducated.  They don't even know where their money is actually going. The government is interested in doing its job properly by applying and collecting taxes.  A shortage of electricity and gas will continue in the same manner.
Everyone knows about the character of those who have been elected by our own nation.
The crisis of electricity and gas lacking all over Pakistan has hit a critical state.
On the other hand the gas tariff has been raised to eight percent.  In some cities, due to the shortage of petrol, the difficulties and miseries of the population increases.
Due to the long shedding of electricity and gas crisis in Pakistan's industrial and business sector, there is a severe public reaction.  Riots and violent protests are breaking out.
Industry holders gave an ultimatum to stop mills.
Here there is an unbelievable situation in cities by the load shedding of light in Karachi from 8 to 10 hours.
The industrial became approximately hand less and feet less.
Government institutes are showing their opinions by blaming one another.
Talks with nation of increase the prices of electric and gas in not a joke.
Why did not pay attention to solve these problems?
The government is not going to work for upwards.
What will you suggest about the control in this big problem?
Inform me of your opinion.
After the loss of Imram, that as there are people as there are commonders.
I wonder if those who shout slogans for an public administration are a nuisance to the public.
It is torture not to get jelly, petroleum and gas.
Government departments have lost control.
Law and order has been degenerated. May Allah show his mercy  on this country of ours.
A new year has begun.
Last year was a year of political turmoil and chaos. It will be remembered for terrorism too.
President Musharaf's stepping down from power, the end of President Bush's eight years' reign, the slinging of chappals to Bush, the rethroning of democracy in Pakistan,the unexpected disasters, the earthquake in Baloochistan, the financial melt down all over the world,the depression in the market
The new year has set in. How do you feel now at the new year's arrival?
In your opinion, What color will the political and geographical situations in the country take? What tricks will Obama adopt?
Is it possible to predict an end to the threatening terrorism?
When will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?
What turn will the Indo-Pakistani relations take?
Is there any chance of a surgical strike or a full-fledged war?
What are your expectations for the new year?

It is the one year anniversary of the death of Benazir Bhutto. She was slain after an election rally in Liaqat Bagh, Rawalpindi on December 27,2007.
Benazir Bhutto was a thoughtful politician and a world reknowned figure. She held a special status in national politics.
Although it's been a year now, the mystery of her death remains unsolved.
Her efforts to bring democracy to Pakistan were not in vain.
Today a democratic government exists in Pakistan and her husband, Asif Zardari , currently holds the position of President of Pakistan.
What do you think is the role of martyr Benazir Bhutto in Pakistani politics?
Who could have murdered her?
Recently, she was given the global human rights award. What comments do you have concerning her democratic and political services?
After spending eight years in office, American president George Bush left the White House for Camp David to allow for preparation of the White House according to the new president, Barack Obama's, wishes.
The historic attacks on the World Trade Center and on the Pentagon and the global War on Terrorism fought in both Afghanistan and Iraq - involving armies from many countries and exhausting American resources - were some of the most memorable events of Bush's eight years of presidency.
As a result of this war, America faced the worst economic and financial crisis in its history.
What do you think the world gained and what do you think it lost as a result of this war?
Were the policies of President Bush successful?
What are your views concerning the Bush era?
The Indian government has prevented the Indian cricket team from touring Pakistan.
The Indian Cricket Team had to play three tests, five one day matches, and a 20 twenty on Pakistan Tour.
The Vice-President of the Indian Cricket Board Rajeev Shukla said that the board has asked the government to allow the Pakistan Tour.  Howver, because of the serious matters between the two countries, this tour is not possible.
Is it right to use the political issue of the Indian government as the reason to cancel the cricket tour? The games must be kept away from politics.
Isn't the decision of the Indian Government towards cricket a loss?
Even though the security in India was poor, the English Cricket Team tour was going on, so why can't the Indian team do the Pakistan Tour?
What is your opinion in this regard?
Salman, Karachi.
People who feel proud on going to India.
And their films and videos which are made there, now their eyes must open to see that how much the Indian people respect you.
I remember one interview of Adnan Samee where he said "I am not a Pakistani, my popularity is British."
Adnan Sami needs that he should come to Pakistan at first opportunity because respect did not suited him even there.
Fareed Ahmad
Karachi
The attitude of Indian citizens has changed after the Mumbai attacks.
Jagjit showed his reaction in the form of hatred for Pakistan and Pakistani citizens.
It should be known that Adnan Sami sung seven songs of Asha Bhosla. Now, how can he be out of tune? Adnan Sami should stay in India, there is no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam
Karachi. I will only say this about Jagjit Singh: he changes color like a chameleon.
He gives statements of worth to Pakistanis but is blind to how much worth they are to Indians. He should try understand the thoughts of the Hindu population.
After the Mumbai incident, their hateful statements have become more fervent. Now they are spitting poison against the popular singer Adnan Sami.
I have a dream in which I have a house in a beautiful evergreen valley, with flowering trees on the top of the hill.
Each morning, one of the flowers that fall from the trees lands in the valley where my small nest-like house is located.
The second thing was about your future.
At night, while sleeping on the terrace, I am able to view the whole star bloomed sky.
I can see the melting mist in the valley, the gold-bangled hands working in the tiled kitchen, watching my hard work bloom up in the compound.
Looking at the twinkling stars, I feel the softness of fondling fingers, all while inhaling the fragrance of night jasmine.
What is your opinion about this?
By wearing a mask all the time, you lost your face. You have developed the art of having the brightness of truth even while uttering blank lies.
I was always dominated by an uncontrollable thirst for affection.
My problem is something concerned with money.
Many problems face the people of the world that extend beyond human control.
I think that people who don't think properly are the real cause of this.
As a consequence of this, it will  be hard to face the problems that arise in the world's future.
Today itself start for the well beings of the people
What do the people seriously think about this?
Poverty, financial crisis, and diseases are the main challenges that people face in the world's future.
What did the people think about the consequences of dangerous calamities that affected the people?
Let's start today. Are you ready?
We need to act to find the best solution to these problems of today. It won't be easy and we must take risks. Before any other steps, we should prepare our minds and have a positive attitude.
The world has faced many past calamities such as earthquakes, floods, and tsunamis, yet we still have not developed precautionary measures to deal with them. We have acted only after they occurred. Our scientists thus need to develop the necessary steps to prepare for these calamities beforehand.

Chicago.
This is true that she has martyred; but we also remember that she killed many innocent in Karachi that she was proud of that Naiseer Ullah Baber has done a great job.
But then she totally changed.
But this is also true that he neglected senior people in his party and chose his son as a party leader what Democracy is this.
Jimmy Noor, Karachi. This news proved Quran that said that Non-believer will support only Non-Believer.
An axe cant cut the wood if it does not have a wooden handle.
Our rulers are responsible for our country's hardships and problems.
May God bless our rulers with rightness.
A panel of the U.N. Security Council has included the names of Hafaiz Saeed and three other Pakistanis in the list of terrorists.
The names of Hafiz Mohammad Saeed (the chief Jamat-ul-Dawa), Rehman Lakhvi (Lashkar-i-Taiba's chief of operations), and Haji Mohammad Ashraf (Lashar-i-Taiba's head of finance) have been included in the list of terrorists.

Beside these, Saudi citizen Mehmood Ahmed's name is also included on this list of terrorists.
Jamat-ul-Dawa, Passban-i-Kashmir and Alrashid trusts are included in these organizations.
The member countries will freeze the assets of these people and organizations. These people will not be allowed to travel and they will be arrested if they do.
They have to face the cases.
Aren't these sanctions made under the influence of Indian propaganda?
Why is India blaming these parties for the Bombay attacks without any proof?
Aren't there any terrorist groups in India?
Are International groups not aware of the tortures being committed on the minorities in India?
