'First Nuclear Experiment was conducted in 1990'
Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer, had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.
This book was titled "Nuclear Express: Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation," and both writers have claimed that whichever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or had the support of another nuclear power.
Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990 during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Thomas Reid said that, for many reasons, he believes that China had tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
The reasons include the design of the bomb and some information gained during talks with the Chinese scientists.
He further added that this was the reason that in 1998 in a span of only two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments in response to Indian nuclear experiments.
Thomas Reid reminds us that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiments.
He added that the atom bomb that was tested on May 19th 1998 by Pakistan was made very carefully, and that Pakistani scientists had complete faith in it.
When Thomas Reid was asked whether China had provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.
He said that there was proof that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and that the documents received from Libya will verify this fact.
Upon further questioning as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.
He said that we also predicted that Israel has access to the results of this experiment.
Thomas Reid was also asked about China's nuclear distribution program which is ongoing.
In answer, Thomas Reid said that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Esfahan, Iran since 1991.
Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.
He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen through North Korea.

On Tuesday, the organization of journalists, RIUJ, held protests in front of the Islamabad Press Club of Journalists and Newspaper Workers against media owners and the government about the news channel and newspapers removing many of their employees.
Speaking to the protesters, a senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, the Federal Union of Journalists,  C.R. Shamsi said, "The politicians who protested with us yesterday on the streets, today, have become rulers and are sitting in Parliament. Out of fear of a certain lobby of media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of journalists."
He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.
An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.
He said that the TV and newspaper owners were on a permanent protest in front of parliament, saying that steps should be taken for the rights of journalists.

He said that until now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been removed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is being feared that the owners will remove hundreds more in the present year, making an excuse of the present financial crisis.

Bitterness between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Rajab Tayyab Erdogan almost shouted at Israeli President and said that the blood of many people has been shed in Gaza. He felt sorrow watching that people can actually applaud this military action from Israel.
Mr. Erdogan said "I think you are using such words to erase your guilt and that in a high voice. But you killed people and I am remembering those children who were killed near the shore."
Simon said that Gaza's calamity is not Israel, but Hamas, who have established a dangerous dictatorship over there.
A correspondent of BBC from Davis says that nothing like this has been seen before in an international economic forum.
However, Erdogan later stated that he respected the Israeli president and his age, which is why he did not scream at him, but whatever he was saying was very far from the truth.
Turkey is one of the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, but for the last few years there has been tension between them.
The attacks were not planned in Pakistan.
Speaking to Indian news channel NDTV, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said that the report of the Pakistani investigations into the Mumbai blast will be prepared soon.
More than 170 people were killed in last November's Mumbai attacks. 
According to India, the extremist organization Lashkre Taiba is responsible for the attacks. 
India also said that Pakistani 'state factors' were guilty in the Mumbai attacks.
After the Mumbai attacks, the relations between the two countries were affected.
High Commissioner Wajid Shams ul Hassan delivered his first statement about the Pakistani investigations, which shows what could be in the investigations report. 
Wajid Shams ul Hassan said:  Investigators have found that these attacks were not planned in Pakistan. 
It must be some other place, not England.
These were the two places (Pakistan and Britain), about which I was in doubt.
India and the global brotherhood has put considerable pressure on Pakistan to take action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan says that it has arrested dozens of people during the action against groups which were clearly involved in the Mumbai attacks.
Wajid Shamsul Haq said: "We are not trying to cover it up."
We believe in taking action based on facts.
Our investigations will be accepted by the world.
We will try to satisfy India with the results (of the investigation).
while defending the delay in the investigation in Pakistan he said that it takes time to collect, understand and check these kind of information.
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that India took 45 days to hand over its dossier.

India claims that Lashkar-e-Taiaba and Jaish-e-Mohammad are present in Jammu. 
There are reports of the presence of militants in the Ponch province of Jammu.
According to official sources, on receiving secret information, police and army have surrounded the area and begun a search.
At this time a fight started in which four militants, two soldiers and one policeman were killed.

Meanwhile, the Chief Minister selected by the joint government, Umar Abdullah, met with the governor and informed him about his being selected the leader of his party, the National Conference in the assembly.
Congress, the ally of the National Conference, also informed the governor of their advocacy of Omar Abdullah.
Umar Abdullah will be administered the oath as the Chief Minister of the State tomorrow.
Remember, the National Conference became the biggest party in the current state elections by gaining 28 seats in the assembly of 87 members. Keep in mind that Separatist Parties boycotted the elections.
The Congress party, which got 17 seats, was prepared to form a joint government with the National Conference.
Party workers welcomed Omar Abdullah with great fanfare on his arrival in Srinagar today.
On this occasion, Umar Abdullah said that he would try to play a role in generating dialog between the Indian government and separatists. However, this would not be possible until the elections took place and the new government came to power in India.
The role of European Union for the peace in Middle East 
From the official point of view, the role of the European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
It is the official stand of Brussels, that Schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of Sarkozy offer helping hands in this process. 
The spokesperson of the European Commission, Amadeu Altafaj, said that every effort which helps advancing the joint message of the European Union to the two parties is welcome.
As far as the state policy is concerned, everyone seems alright.
However, in reality, the European Union is in a sad state of internal differences.
The role of Czech Republic, as the President of the Union, is already weak. 
On top of that, internal fighting has made it all the more helpless.
On the other hand, the French President, Sarkozy, is behaving as if he is still the President of the European Union.
France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a presidential role, and he is able to, but he does not have the permission to do so.
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner faces the most pleasant task. 
He is in the delegation which is led by Schwarzenberg, the Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic. 
The problem is both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements about war in the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself, whereas according to Kouchner this war does not come under defense policy. On the other side, Germany has also sent its special ambassador to the Middle East. The European Union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues.
Its evidence is the reaction of Israel, which does not give any importance to the conciliation efforts of the EU.
This is a golden chance for the European Union to do something since America, due to the policies of George W. Bush, has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial crisis: German millionaire industrialist commits suicide. 
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany, left a huge business group behind him.
But earlier common German citizens did not know much about him.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.
The financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed one billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on Marclay. 
Some time back, the bank agreed to provide Merkel Group an emergency loan. But, Adolf Merkel,who raised a small industrialist group to the position of a strong industrial group whose annual income was approximately 30 billion Euro, could not bare the loss in his investment capability.
After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quickly, putting it on a new track.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm,the  Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel Group around the world is near 100,000, and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical company Ratiopharm, always had special importance.
Adolf Marclay has said this many times in his life. """"We have been in pharma business since four generations"""". 
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the management of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks sanctioned 400 million euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it can improve its financial conditions in the long term.
Likewise after the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain as it was.
Crime rate of foreigners living in Germany 
According to recent statistics the crime rate of foreigners between 2004 to 2007 changed only .22%. 
dropped from 22.9%
4%. 
According to Joachim Herrmann, the Bavarian Interior Minister, this would appear to be a positive change.
He said: "It is important to note that the number of foreigners getting German citizenship is increasing."
Therefore this should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German, his background is foreign.
Herrmann said that from 2010 his state will keep this fact in mind while collecting the data of criminals. 
Besides Bavaria, Hamburg is also thinking  along the same lines.
Senator Christoph Ahlhaus of CDU's Interior Ministry said: ""When the scientific research is conducted one can not draw results of his own rather they depend on the data which is calculated after research. 
Ahlhaus diverted the attention to a research report from the anti crime's provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamberg, it was investigated that out of all crimes happening there what percentage have the involvement of foreigners.
The crime rate by foreigners crime rate was less than the general population of the province. 
had a lower crime percentage than the crimes taking place in the whole state.
Contrary to this, during 2006, when the percentage of youngsters committing crimes was calculated, it became evident that the youngsters from a foreign background committing crime was 44
.7 percent.
However, other political parties of Germany for example, SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei,were against this proposal that while collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired which German citizens have foreign backgrounds.

President Ahmadinejad said, expressing surprise over the Arab countries and their leaders' silence over the beastly acts of Israel, that Israel is subjecting the Palestinian public to a holocaust.

Israel is committing massacre by slaughtering children, women and common people and America's President is praising him. This is the humanity and freedom the America that the world is witnessing in Gaza and other parts of the world.

Tea: an Effective Cure for Breast Cancer
According to a new research, three cups of tea a day
greatly reduces the risk of the lung cancer in women under the age of 50. 
Research at the Moffitt Cancer Center in the American State of Florida, has showed that chances of getting chest cancer in those women under 50 years of age
who drink at least three cups of tea everyday is reduced by 37%.
The research shows that the aged women don't get any effect from drinking three or more cups of tea a day.
Specialists think that this is because of the presence of such components in tea that are more effective against the types of cancer tumors which usually target women under 50 years of age.
In Moffitt Cancer Center, in the city of Tampa, Florida state, a research was conducted on over 5000 women, who had undergone treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles with women who were safe from breast cancer.
The experts also found out that on a particular type of cancer, Lobular, tea had shown a great effect and it reduced by 66 percent.
Almost every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type of it.
This type of cancer is more dangerous because it is deeper and is usually only known after it spreads quite a bit.
Experts say that by drinking at least three cups of tea a day, the danger of breast cancer can be reduced in young women.
They say that incorporating tea as a regular drink in your daily routine helps create immunity against the cancer.
In Britain, approximately 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year.

Why Reduce Exercise With Age?
New research
Exercise is good for health at any age. 
It energizes your heart, reduces cholesterol levels, helps in keeping weight low, helps to prevent diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer's or dementia.
Unfortunately, with many people with increasing age reduces the ability to exercise.
experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active, however, age can affect it.
The American Medical Association says that Many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out.
Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.
She headed a research trial regarding heart diseases and the ability to participate in exercise in older age.
The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the workings of the heart.
The pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.
The experts focused on the left part of the heart, which is the main part for pumping blood.
They came to know ,that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.
Dr. Patricia says that with increase in age, the problems in the heart relaxation rates increases and thus effects the ability to exercise with growing age. 
Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research.
He says that they were surprised to see that it has an effect, as it confirmed that poor exercising ability is closely related to the heart's relaxation phase.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause disorders in heart functions and heart disease.
If doctors and patients can work together on the problem of heart disease, then they can enjoy the benefits of exercise even with older age. 
A detailed report of this has been published in the magazine of the American Medical Association.
No Chances of an Immediate War with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief
The chief of the Indian Army, General Deepak Kapoor has stated that there are no chances of immediate war with Pakistan. However, to serve the country and protect its interests, the Indian Army is always ready.
General Kapoor claimed that despite assurances and international pressure following the Mumbai attacks, the terrorism network is not only present in Pakistan but is also active. 
He said this while talking to correspondents in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day tour of the valley of Kashmir in order to analyze both the overall security situation in New Delhi administered Kashmir and the preparation of armed forces on the borders.
He was asked what his reaction was to the media reports which state that Pakistan refuted the proof presented by India about the Mumbai attacks.

May Allah bless the tongues of the world and may Barack become a blessing for the world.
Though there is not much hope, we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan are effected by this change.
We shall also see what Barack Obama, who is the result of Martin Luther King's dreams, gives to the world.
Obama, part of whose name is Husain, taking the oath today, as the American President, is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance, but also a historic test.
Not only for himself, but also for all the people who supported him.
It will even be a test for the white majority, as for them to accept from their hearts, a black governing over them is no easy task.
Those here in South Asia, especially the Muslims, who have hopes about him should remember that he was elected the president of America, and Obama should remember that the president of America is actually the president of the world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th president of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
It is necessary for people who like him not to have excessive expectations of him. 
If Obama becomes successful in decreasing the religious and racial acrimony, it will be a victory for his fans.
What effect will this change have on South Asia, and what considerable change can be expected in the American policy in this regard?
How will this change affect the relationship between America and Pakistan?
BBC 
Sir, whether it be Obama or someone else, the type of policies with regards to the whole world are decided by the multi-billionaire, influential, strong Jewish lobby.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts, the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is obvious to everyone.
After the formation of Pakistan, the South was under Wali South, which had a single rule. 
With the help of an agreement they transferred the administration of Swat to the Pakistani government.
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a step mother.
After the end of the governance of the King, there were no more schools founded in Swat.
Nor was there any interest in the construction and development over there.
Presently, fewer girls sought an education. 
The Taliban continue their attacks on educational institutions in the NWFP.
Swat has suffered the highest number of schools destroyed, and the majority of them have been all girls schools.
Not only this, but the Taliban have announced the prohibition of girls education in Swat.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.
what do you think, by stopping girl's education, what the Taliban want to achieve?
Why has the government been unsuccessful in stopping these illegal steps?
What actions do you think the government should take to stop these illegal activities.
The question should be, what do the ISI and Pakistani agencies get?
Because the people of Swat have realized this was a game and that the army was there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them. Otherwise, how could five schools be blown up in a single curfew night? How could people be slaughtered during curfew and hung in the center of the town?
When the government is not being allowed to have any say in Swat, how can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps?
Now, the question arises as to how, when the government has an armed military, new and dangerous weapons, new technology and spy system etc., these four Taliban elements are not being controlled?
The only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught. 
The conclusion is that the Taliban, through their dark activities, are making the work of the global leadership easier.
Fifteen years ago, the war was on in Afghanistan.
The ISI was controlling the Taliban while on the opposing side the Northern Coalition was being aided by Russia, India and Iran.
Then, suddenly, the situation changed and the Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of Dollars from America, so the previous friend became an enemy.
Now the scenario is that the war is still raging but the supporters in Pakistan are still the same Iran, India, and Russia.
It is a human mistake of doing wrong by not doing what is right. 
If a thief robs a place, then he is in danger to rob the same place and same time tomorrow as well. If he fears god and man, he will not steal. 
Similarly, Israel should realize that it is wrong to shed blood in Gaza. 
Greetings!
The question is whether war and terrorism are solutions to the problem?
If not, then what is the solution?
This extremist path of war does not solve our problems but increases them.    Our problems are increased by the path of war the extremist take. 
Palestine, Afghanistan, and Iraq should adopt practices used by Nelson Mandela in South Africa in order to gain independence.
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
kashmiri's participation in election shows that they have accepted his point.
Israeli attacks have gone on in Gaza for 3 weeks, and the death toll has reached 1000.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date, a ceasefire was not possible.
And according to a guess 9000 Falatinis have been left their homes and gone to save places after the attacks  starting in December.
Charitable organizations blame Israel for failing to care for the mental and emotional problems caused to Palistinian children.
What are you saying?
what do you think should to be done?
How is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Taliban should be given a chance.

Wake up! If the Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down the girls schools?
They will be kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
These Taliban have damaged Islam so much that no other nation or religion has done.

Kohat, Pakistan
If the entire Muslim world gets together and even just threatens Israel, you will see how much Israel's daddy, America, will get hurt.
And immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well.
But what can be done, where can our leaders get so much courage?
Someone should tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step since he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
Peace and human rights are not the sole responsibility of the Arabs or the Muslims of the world, but it is the obligation of the entire world community to raise their voice against tyranny. 
This dreadful incident is Bush's worst crime. 
On June 30th, before the close of the financial year in Pakistan and India, the government institutions are looted, in the same way. Similarly, before the winding up of the American government, Israel was given the green signal to do whatever it wants.
On one hand, America says that efforts will be made for a ceasefire.
On the other hand, the United Nation is passing one resolution after another but both have done nothing practically. This means that united nation is also working  to crush the Muslims.
All Muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the United Nations, and should establish their own global organization.
We have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations are seen, but the harm is only done to the Muslims.
What is the use of this probaganda when BBC is not going to publish it. 
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically of Muslims, is spilled, the monster of unbiasedness gets onto BBC's back.
by the way is a flag bearer of rights
Saying something from their side is a far away thing when they do not even want comments.
For the Muslims.
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, while you stay among Muslims, call yourselves Muslims and cause Muslims..
[syja786]
For a long time, BBC forums have been using a certain word, sometimes while discussing suicide attacks and other times, while discussing terrorism in India.
Extremism is the favorite word for those anti-islamic comments.
But who is the extremist? That you can easily figure out from the above comment.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal cannot be fought with the sword?
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what can one do other than cry?
But the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that we try to use the name of Jihad to disfigure the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existence of Israel, what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks?
The conduct of both sides is misanthropic.
The role of the UN and the USA was again seen as favoring the injustice of Israel.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
And we should think about giving the real terrorists an anti-terrorism Nobel prize for their painstaking efforts against terrorism, as after all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, would it be possible for terrorism to take place at such a large scale without the support of some big leader? And everyone knows who is controlling the strings.
In easy words, such gangsters are told to do whatever they want.
Hitting people hard and leaving them crying.    (There is no subject of this sentence -- who is doing the hitting?) 
The Arab rulers are giving medicines for the injured, funeral clothings for the dead and money and they are asking
Israeli attacks, what should happen?
This is the actual problem that the leaders of Muslim countries including Saudi crownprince are in a false sleep, neither they have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
They should immediately take practical steps against Israel.
For example, stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Greetings to all brothers and sisters!    (Is this part of the article?) 
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is similar to considering them defeated.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature. The steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Hamas and Israel should reconcile so that this bloodshed comes to an end. 
Muhammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France.
This is absolutely true. 
Suppose that Hamas is 100% truthful, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah.  Even then, they should know that if a good deed results in the destruction of an established house, it is no longer a good deed.
For those who claim to love God, love the messenger, and love their religion, loving mankind is a part of their faith.
As if it is the order of Allah to evacuate all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than the Muslims.
Rehman helps people who are probably KI (-N find 
The order is not to kill them but to invite them to Islam.
Jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion.
One should fight with them until they finish their conspiracies, but this certainly does not mean that they can wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the fate of the murderer of innocent children is annihilation. 
I ask my friends about the Israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past. They have become so strong today that they don't listen to any one. This is because the Jews are united.
There are no Sheas and Sunnis. There are all just Jews and they have developed everything in every field.
In contrast, what is the condition of 55 Islamic countries?
They are behind in every field, and now the situation is that they have become so helpless that the enemy is killing them and they are waiting to die.
It is essential that all Muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
There is no better strategy than to recognize Israel, learn modern education and means of progress, and let the world live in peace and harmony.
Muslims have vast and and resources. 
There is a need to put them to proper use. 
The first and most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque.  This was impossible without getting Yasin and Arafat out of the way.
The world is witnessing how Palestine has been scattered  after the death of these two leaders.
and how the Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
In 1974, a Pakistani Prime Minister was such an internationally trusted Muslim representative, that first time in the history he united all the Muslim leaders under one roof without exception. 
Today on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task for the whole nation to promise to keep unity in its lines.
By eliminating the differences among  Muslims, it will complete its mission of establishing an Islamic Commonwealth. 
This is the Demon which has tormented Palestine for half a century. 
this jinn have many face.
Many times this monster criticizes itself from a different mouth, to divert the attention of the world.
and this jinn other face eating peoples in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
and this jinn have a big fear of Islam, as this jinn knows that when ever he pull out this only and only by Islam Muslims and Muslims complete religion and act of Islam pull out because history said that Islam put on right track many biggest Abujahal.
Israel has been bombarding Gaza with air attacks and missiles since the 27th of December. 
In this attack, more than three hundred residents have died.
Since the air attacks, Israeli tanks and other land-invading military vehicles have reached the border of Gaza. 
Through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
Israel official said that they will continue action in Gaza until the rocket attacks on Israel end.
In your opinion is it right for Israel to say this inspection is to protect Israel? 
What is the international community to do?
Is this situations due to the uprisings in Israel? 
Can any improvement be expected in the situation in Middle East after the succession of the newly elected American president Barak Obama?

When has the night of loneliness been spent shedding tears?
When has a calamity been averted only by supplication? (Nawab Zadah Nasrullah Khan)
BBC searches for such comments and publishes them.
After all, it has to keep up the flag and perception of non-alignment.
Although the news from BBC is usually correct but the real thing is the style of the news.
Which news to be made prominent and which news to be considered as insignificant.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
In this art now a days; the Pakistani electronic and print media, especially some Urdu newspapers and columnists, are no more behind anyone who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism, or in the ""grudge of Muavia"" written on them.
Has said that the United Nations, which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of it's mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. How long will this hypocrisy continue?
Why there is so much atrocity committed on Muslims. If people like Americans are backing up the Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So, Americans, if you have courage then stop supporting them and see then what their fate is.
The just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.
In the words of a poet
Injustice is injustice. If it breeds, it dies. 
Blood is blood. If it bleeds, it dies. 
Now who will tell whom what is terrorism?
Is all this not included in terrorism? Why does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocents not red?
And now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere?
I watched the Mumbai incident, and felt as if my own house was on fire. The sorrow of those affected was overwhelming. If only there was a solution to this war.
I see dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood. How shall we condemn? I can not find words!
I feel like crying about the helplessness of Muslims, that on one side, people are dying in India, and the whole world is climbing onto Pakistan, without any proof and saying, take action or else we will.
And on the other side, Israel is ruthlessly killing Muslims and the whole world is silent. This is unbearable.
God has light, not darkness. And when this darkness ends ... 
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
As far as elections are concerned, it is not surprising that the people who are in power do such things to win the heart and mind of people, especially in a state like Israel. And speaking of Barak Obama, history shows that no American president has wavered from the policy and will not do so in future. A tyrant is a tyrant whether he is white or black. 
From the discussions going on in the forum, it seems that everyone is hurt over her death, but as a politician, her mistakes have not been ignored.
It is debatable that Benazir died for democracy or for power. 
If democracy was dearer, why did she leave the republic for ten years in the control of Musharraf, waiting for American clearance and deal?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when people affected by dictatorship needed her. Unfortunately she came to Pakistan when she was assured by the government that she will be freed from trails.
There is no one remaining to say about the criticism and accusations of a historical personality.

Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them.

How merciless is our nation? We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party, but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.
We have progressed enough. 
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored, thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar if you en wreathe him with books.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks, Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.
If the talk is about war, then there will be many loss of human lives. 
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu but on the other hand when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader, point to be noted.
First of all, Merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and all our Christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
We do not want the flames of war, we want the flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
What problems can war solve?
It will give fire and blood today.
Tomorrow it will give hunger and privation.
Therefore, O intelligent people,
It is better that war is postponed.
In your and our garden
It's better that the glim keeps lightened
The India-America relations have deepened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
This is that the old history of America.
Because in the case of an Indian attack, America's goals will also be fulfilled but the expenses will be India's.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation or ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied, even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
This is Islamic history.
Even before this resolution, the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
In compensation for the Mumbai attacks, the abnormal diplomatic and military benefits that India tried to gain, made it more a victimizing party, than a victim. That is why, in contrast to the harsh initial global reactions, the world has now reduced their force on Pakistan.
While ignoring India's unnecessary bobbery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a "Side Effect" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
There are no two opinions about this being a very beastly action.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past year?
How many Taliban are killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday?
I appeal to the I.S.I, that for God's sake, stop monitoring the Taliban and let us live in peace in our heavenly hometown Sawat.
And stop this phony operation.
The day is not far when a resolution will be passed in the United Nations against army intervention in Pakistan, the same way as it was passed against Jama'athud-Da'wah.
Riyaz Ahmed Farooqui
Extremists and their supporters are continuously providing reasons for the actions taken against them. When such a resolution is submitted, it will be likely that no one will favor us in the UN. 
And supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
The bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah, and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are immortal even after they die.
But there is an international game being played over here. Here, they are ruling by scaring the public about beastliness and terror.
So that license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will clutch the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so-called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
The supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of America, but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions, they give it the name of tribal traditions and clearly avoid it.
No person with a heart can accept these beastly actions, which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of Islam.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so clever that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also men of God and so is our army.
It is very clear that there is something fishy.
Instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and punitive occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion, was seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
You frighten the world with the fires of Hell.
you yourself have become the reason of fear.
It is surprising when it is said that this cannot be the work of a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Upon the death of the Prophet, upon refusing to pledge alliegance, who burned the door of the daughter of the Messenger and pulled her husband out with a rope around his neck?
Had they come from somewhere outside?
Was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
Without accepting the facts, neither motives can be removed nor can they be corrected.
BBC people, stop this dual policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Chowdhry, Japan
Please show some modesty. A human was pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office?
For the success of Operation Sherdil and across the border the success of Operation Lion Heart depends on the favor of people. 
This step of American and Pakistani intelligence agencies and Pir Sahib is the victim of this conspiracy.
All discussions on this forum will now be anti-Taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined Taliban and they are doing what they can to change the public opinion.
I only want to ask that while this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public? They even report something like this: 'While bombing Taliban residences, a stray shell kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000 in Swat went there to do.
The bodies of the Taliban who help the army are left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green-footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC, did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake, stop this drama.
These Taliban members have destroyed the image of Muslims.
Through out the world if Muslims don't tell them Muslims then why would terrorists are found in their territories. 
those who become insensitive and people who don't want to work hard take guns and join these groups 
Islam has not came under the pressure of gun or sword.
Have shame.
It's baseless has no roots in any religion nor in family customs.
All media including the BBC show different views on Taliban and tribals.
But nobody knows what the actual situation is. It is we who know about it because we are tribals. 
In short, its a game in which the CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a talib or a tribal. Who made these institutions? Warmongers--who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions.
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is the Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that the current leadership will remove this cancer.
After the Mumbai incident, India said that extremists were behind the attacks.
Pakistan denies the blames and said it will give all possible assistance to India in interrogation.
India said that it has given a list to Pakistan of 20 suspected extremists wanted by India.
Now Pakistan says that the Jaish-e-Mohammad leader, who is included in the list, Moulana Mas'ood Azhar, is not under house arrest, and that the government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Previously, the President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari had rejected the idea that western intelligence agencies and the Indian government had provided Pakistan proof about the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said that it is not yet proven that Ajmal Qasab is Pakistani. 
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned Pakistan that its relationship with India cannot improve if it's land is being used for terrorism.
And in the latest developments, the Indian cricket team canceled their tour of Pakistan.
Should these political events affect sports?
How do you see the future developments of the relationship between Pakistan and India? 
Neither America nor India will break Pakistan.
Pakistan will be broken by Pakistanis themselves.
What do you expect after so much provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism.
Time has proved that Jinnah did no good for the Indian Muslims.
Yasmin, Chicago.
Madam, If  Mr. Jinnah's vision had been realized, neither the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism would have  spread in Pakistan nor would the Muslims in India have displayed such behavior.
It is our fault that we couldnt reproduce a leader of similar stature.
If we can't respect our leaders, then who can we respect?
This sector does have a lot of abilities. 
God knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
In both countries the Mullahs, Pundits, Taliban, Shiv Sena, the RSS, etc have been established to oppose the progression of peace.
And these negative forces do not want the sector to make any progress, hence the countries are kept on their toes. 
Can you imagine what status this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world?
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
May God protect Pakistan from any harm, Amen.
Please be open about the facts of the situation, take notice of the warning signs that they will reach the troops. 
Besides, you have misstated the situation in NWFP, Baluchistan and Sindh, and Karachi. 
The winner in her country is a spokesperson, and her ambition is to unite the nations. 
Oh Allah, bestow your mercy upon us.
In my opinion, there is no way other than a last war.
Enough is enough.
It's now or never.
These false acts of cooperation will not solve the problem. 
And neither with small big terrorism in each other countries.
After all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
and if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be stopped.
But our military leadership does not seem to be sincere in this regard. On one hand, they assure America and Europe that they are with them in this war against terror and on the other hand, are covertly aiding the Taliban. 
We should think and fix our direction and choose only one side.
There is no doubt that the majority of the Movement Leagues are from the Tayaba Group, who joined the Leagues after the inception of Pakistan. 
Although these members only did subsidiary activities, after India's great insistence The United Nations has invalidated the group.  The government of Pakistan is also  continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it's better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
Terrorist groups in Pakistan, support professional criminals and the heads of those are Mullahs who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.
They are not letting any stone unturned in the way to destruction of Pakistan. 
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan of these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous persons or not?
There is no place in this world for extremist mullahs whose only purpose is to kill. 
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What type of world is this in which it is very difficult to follow the preachings of Allah's Islam.
Non-Muslim can kill Muslims, but when Muslims try to take revenge then all non-Muslims along with the whole world think that Islamic preaching is done with Hafiz Sayeed.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-Pak relationships turned sour, for the first time suffering a severe setback.
Pakistani relations are affected, and the recent improvement in relations between the two countries are stopped. 
India has always claimed that militant and non-militant groups which are active in Pakistan are responsible.
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the actions against these groups. 
The Indian security centers have blamed them for the attack on Mumbai, saying the Lashkar-e-tayab is responsible.
Jamat Adawa has also been nominated. 
It is not the first time that because of a terrorist attack, the relationship between these two countries is worsened. 
In December 2001, after the attack on the parliament, the two neighbors were prepared to go to war.
After that, in 2002, Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
Now Jamat Adawa, to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of Lashka-e-Taiba, is demanded to be banned. 
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan conduct decisive operations against extreme activists on its land?
Can putting a ban on Jama'athud Da'wah help the present Indo-
Pak crisis could resolve and for real peace in between two countries how important is that to finished groups who have weapons?
The Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all, what proof does the Security Council have to decide this so quickly?
Does the Security Council always show urgency against the Muslims?
To say that the plaintiff has a mercurial attitude is an understatement! 
India's own government has become a failed government! 
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were brought to their knees by a few terrorists for three days. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To the dear nation of one nonpolitical, religious, farming organization
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have advanced in every field.
But when this beautiful Religion rose to the hands of distillation then within the human beings began the difference of religious and disbeliever and the new gateways of pride and prejudice began to open by which the world was unknown before.
Salute, sir, salute happily, but get your work done on your own.
Don't do it under the pressure of America.
If India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give evidence?
And why do they accuse us of everything?
There are fundamentalist groups and organisations even in India. Why does no one put any restrictions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the world?
What is it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What is it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the first Islamic Nuclear State. Is this what the fight is about?
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamranhassan, ABU DHABI
Your words touch the heart, and the situation seems so. 
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all of these sanctions seem to be part of this conspiracy.
The Americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over Pakistan. 
In this situation, if we do not stand together and show our unity, then remember, if Bangladesh can be made, then anything can happen. 
Terrorists attacks should be condemned, whether these are committed in Mumbai, Islamabad or in Philistine.
These terorrists should be punished whether they are from Pakistan, India, America or Israel.
Now the question is that why the whole world, including Pakistani officials, are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack on the Mariat hotel a terrorist attack?
Then why?
Praise the worthy Advisor interior,Mister Rehman Malik,by the grace of God, how brave he has become!
According to BBC, on one hand Security Council of UN has banned the Jamat Aldawa. On the other, Mr. Malik says they didn't impose the ban and if it is to be done, it will be after a thorough research. 
not only this, but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under 'someones's pressure'.
Brother, Subhanallah!
Having this capability or not, that I don't want to say.
We, i.e. Pakistan, are fighting somebody else's war.
And also, we are trying to save our policies. 
No one has the right to interfere in any country's affairs.
We cannot notice the reign of good. 
If people have right view of justice and independence, respect government institutions and not help any captain or soldier, then there will definitely be peace in Pakistan, which is not liked by its politicians. 
For example, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
In fact, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population, this problem still occurs.
This enhances the opposition viewpoint and anti-American sentiment.
If America and its Allies believe in Democracy, they should give up their colonial behavior and leave this region
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
Pakistani forces occupying Kashmir raided one of the camps of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba.
Pressure is being increased on Pakistan for taking rapid action against extremist organizations after Mumbai attacks. 
India has claimed that the group based in Lashar-i-tayba had a role in the Mumbai attacks.

He said that the extremists whom attacked Mambae used Pakistani earth.
Meanwhile, Pashawar commanders say that unknown soldiers fired and destroyed 50 miltary trucks.
This is the second attack in Peshawar on NATO and American supplies in the last 48 hours.
Meanwhile, Pakistan made the show of distinctive party Lashkar-e-Taiba and before this was tried to make military persons nonmilitary and military weapons were changed with money and certainly no any action without it.
It is clear from the circumstances that efforts remain unsuccessful to dislodge the armed groups funded by Americans and Saudis during afghan war. It means efforts to restore Pre-80's Pakistan are fruitless.
Question arises, whether Pakistan wants to do so?
Does Pakistan have the ability to do so?
What is your opinion?

I ask only one question from the flag holders of humanity.
If you kill their children, will they come to praise you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan.
And question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies, say any logic, argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men, laborers and poor workers of different occupations, in revenge of American attack?
If your answer is no, then you need to correct your point of view.
People were armed, at that time it was dangerous that Russia will turn toward Pakistan after Afghanistan, therefore people were armed.
Now when the current American President clearly stated that he might attack Pakistan during his presidential campaign, then why should we disarm these people? 
If they defeat the Pakistani Army, America or India do not expect to face any public resistance. 
Yes, if any of them areinvolved in sabotage activities, then the Pakistani government has the responsibility to try him and punish him, if necessary. 
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeeb ur rehman seiko, *Lahore* [P@KI$T@N] 
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
And another question arises, "did these terrorists not have the aid of some government or non-government employee of India"?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As far as Lashkar-e-Tayyaba is concerned, it has no involvement in the recent incidents.
It must be recalled that Hafiz Sayeed was the first 'Militant Leader' who declared activities of Taliban as 'revolt'. 
I am sure that the Taliban effect is an inseparable result of American plans. Hence, every person who can stand in the way of the Taliban must be removed.
Despite the cooperation of the whole nation, Pakistan Government's  action against Lashkar-e-Taiba at the behest of pressure from India, indicates the nervousness and ficklness of Zardari and Co. 
To terminate the expedition started by the funding of America and Saudi Arabia, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society. 
Also question why American and Saudis sell dangerous arms and so called Jihadi but in fact the virus of loathsome literature and culture, due to which human butcher houses established in our country. 
After the threat of attack from India, the announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan, and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly and tried its best to convince India that she should attack Pakistan.
This exposed the weakness of the American Army in the region. 
Although India neither made any threat of an attack nor dared to do so. 
And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of the Taliban on American posts.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and the Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi is Pakistan's business and economic center, and Dubai of the less privileged areas.
Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty-handed, but ever since law and order in the western border regions was lost, everybody diverted their attention here.
Now they are looking to kidnap this city.
For the first time, Pathans began to be called Pukhtons, and the people of a single town are made foreigners and are being made to fight, while the need is for unity.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speakers learn Pashto, or the Pashto speakers learn Urdu, or maybe it's better for everybody to learn English.
You will surely think this as a ridiculous suggestion but do you think that the reason for this conflict is not ridiculous?
The reason of violence is language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, I actually shared this proposal many times in my childhood with my friends, which included people from all religious and linguistic groups, but these people used to laugh at me.
At that time, the religious and linguistic hate which was not as lively and strong as they are today were still developing within.
I don't understand what is happening or why.
Are these the signs of the Day of Judgement?
For what crime are innocent people being killed?
The reasons are in front of everybody, those who want to break up Pakistan are the active ones and those who do such things have neither religion nor country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns.
Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir mean that is what is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of the RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
The unjustified killing of Pashto-speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awakened sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
The identical country loving reaction of all the political, religious, linguistic and national parties has not only taught India the manners of diplomacy, but it has also given the American policy makers a chance to think again.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the horrible situation in Karachi, and the administration is not neutral on the issue. 
The government can control the situation in one hour, but it is purposely allowing it to grow.
Police and rangers abstained from taking any action since they were under pressure from political parties.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
As long as there is political pressure on the government, more incidents will take place. May Allah save Pakistan.
To me, these people are the biggest terrorists.
Foreign powers are definitely involved in this, but no one knows who they are.
But alas, that if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there, but since its not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
The government should set up an operation here, and save a big and important town from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth due to fear, and as for the local media, it is even thinner.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is this that Urdu speaking people should learn Pashto or Pashto speaking people should learn Urdu. It would be even better if everyone learned English.
You will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but don't you think the reason for collision is ridiculous?
that the cause of extremism be language?
There was another story of cruelty recorded in Karachi, the terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
Wherever one could do something, he did everything. Reports in the media are 50% of what has happened here in four days.
I have spent the last three nights sleepless and the fear is still there.
Those who make the people evacuate hotels, those who kill the shoe-makers and the peanut-sellers.
The people who looted the super highway and cut the ears off of innocent people are all unaware of Allah's punishment, which can catch them anytime.
In your opinion, what are the reasons for this sudden disturbance?

Keeping in mind the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in Karachi. It is simple and easy to guess that the turmoil is just due to an unconscious trade of blood.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control.
The blood of Liyaqath Ali Khan and many other brave hearts was also from there. I am writing this poem to get rid of Saiko's misunderstanding.
We will also repeat the traditions of the elders.
They gave their lives to build. we will give our lives to save.
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
It is very disappointing that the whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
org is searched for Liaqat Ali Khan, you will know that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family of an area of Punjab Karnal. 
Because of his service to the Muhajirs, they consider him their leader. 
Every action has a reaction.
One can bear one's self, but...
Ejaz Aiwan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the graffiti of real gangsters these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been seeing both types of mischief.
Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan alone. They did not have to face any reaction.
Quite the opposite, they are pecking at the heart of Pakistan.
One Muslim League N was left. Even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to the People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment to the National Assembly and the Senate.
Until now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment are a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why  no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part. They will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft and that the government speaker did not take any action.
MQM is a coalation with the government. Muslim League(N) is a secret partnership with the government. The Muslim League(Q) is the party that passed the 17th amendment. Now, how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17th Amendment?
This is called getting credit for nothing.
The People's Party is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment anyways.
Nobody can think of cutting his own hands. 
As long as Zardari is the president, the seventeenth amendment is not going to be repealed.
This was the opinion of the majority in one of our surveys and it is correct.
If the 17th Amendment was discarded then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf. Because with being the president, he is also the chairman of the People's Party.
As long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.
In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to bid Zardari farewell from the presidential house.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
Most of the elders in our family belonged to the working class.
In our childhood, when we used to see our uncles doing labor work, we used to pray to Allah to save us from this hard work.
To avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what we should do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor.
The editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and study Science and Math subjects.
We were inclined towards engineering and in matriculation we studied Technical drawing instead of Biology.
But at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.
We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics. 
Fear of labor made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.
I remembered this when I was trying to lift the carpet with my two young sons at our old house.
It was not half an hour since we started working, and the younger son said, "Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job."
We said that if that is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor. 
The son said, "I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work."
Anyway, the three of us finished that work in three hours and returned.
My purpose of saying this is that if a person has set a goal, whatever be the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving his goal.
But if you do not even know what you have to do, then Allah alone is your protector.
It is said that you should not say bad things about the dead, but what shall we do? We see only bad things in Benazir, even on the anniversary of her first death.
On one side, Benazir crushed independence movement of Sikhs by handing over the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India, and on the other hand provided India an opportunity to fully concentrate in Kashmir after crushing the movement in Punjab. 
The greed of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif for government pushed the country back many years. 
Even after her exile, Benazir continued to make negative comments about Kashmir and the nuclear program.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
In her era,Benazir allowed her husband to openly earn money, which is why he came to be known as Mr. Ten Percent.
In Benazir's era, her brother was killed, and his killer has still not been punished.
Besides being a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for womens' rights.
Just as Benazir did her politics over her father's dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came to power twice. She brought the people guilty for the political killing of her father to justice, but she could not even file a case against them.
It has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us, but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
We should have been observing December 16 as a day of reflection and making plans to prevent the reoccurrence of such incidents.
On that day, we sent messages of peace to the people of Bangladesh and tried to bring them closer to us. 
Rulers open the file of Mehmood-ul-Rehman Commission in order to study the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan. 
They are making strategies to bring back the Beharis (ethnic class) stranded in Bangladesh and send them gifts to encourage them. 
But we have become so indifferent that when someone dies in our own neighborhood we don't know about it. 
We don't care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again, like East and West Germany.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem likely to be granted in the near future.
It was announced in the news today that the Governor of the American State Illinois had been arrested on corruption charges.
and to remove him from governorship provincial Congress is preparing for his rapid accountability, our American friend who has a keen interest in Pakistani affairs said to me 'see this is democracy'. 
In America, even the higher level people are not above the law.
and there is your country, Pakistan, whose president has been elected after his corruption charges were dropped.
My vein of loyalty throbbed and I said what is the big deal if a governor was arrested in America? In Pakistan, once the prime minister was arrested and hanged overnight, and another time sent into exile.
Tell me, when did this happen in America?
In Pakistan, those who broke the law were sent out of the presidential palace with a guard of honor. Tell me when this happened in America.
In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was suspended, and, besides public support, he has yet to be restored. Has that ever happened in America?
In Pakistan, a fake-degree holder was made the Minister of Health. Did this happen in America?
After listening to this, the poor American could not stop laughing and also accepted defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded on all four sides by Americans.
It seems from his smile
He thinks that America is with his government. He is forgetting that one year ago, they were with Pervez Musharraf.
This picture was taken at a family gathering. 
Before this no picture, as such, has been published in which the President is with 3 American authorities.
It looks like America's work has been increased in Pakistan and one or more Authorities are working on it or they might not believe that person as compared to the first one.
It might be possible that they have planned this also, keeping in mind the nature of President Zardari's promise fulfillment.
Had he been an intelligent politician then he  would be at least not been smiling in this picture and his face would show some signs of embarrassment.
If the principle of democracy is applied to the members of this picture, then Present Zardari is in the minority. 
In a democracy the majority rules, and the picture reveals the actual rulers. 
Paradisical Swat is also called the "Switzerland of Pakistan".
Till now, according to the Government Policy, cross talks are  going along together with the use of power.
The use of force achieves nothing other than strengthening the Taliban and increasing public sympathies for them. 
The government must, instead of using the power, eliminate the causes of the issue.
By finishing the causes, Fazlullah and the Taliban will be finished themselves.
The Shariat Bill by the ANP government will help address the problem to a great extent. 
In addition to the observance of the Shariat law, the administration will take care of the well being of the people.
At the beginning of General Musharaf rise, it looked like the nation had rid itself of the incompetent politicians, but the lust for power changed all his plans.
Whatever expectations were, after joining the 'war of terror', he began to consider himself irremovable.
The expected actions would never occur. 
When the rule of Bush was coming to an end, he became scared and started dealing with thieves. 
General Musharaf was in a position to control the army, but the present administration doesn't know what is happening.
The Bajaur and Swat terror was uncontrollable by army. 
Despite the military operation in Swat, a war-torn area of NWFP, things are getting worse.
The government to a writ in this region only unwise in the National Assembly passed a resolution is left to the extent , the Taliban and other illegal FM radio channel of influence in Swat much is being . 
The common citizen has no choice but to obey the rule of power.
Security forces in swat have used lethal weapons and claim to have killed many extremists. Despite these causalities, the Taliban's power is rising and they control nearly 80% of Swat.
As a result, GOVT is not accepting its failure and the Taliban is getting stronger.
The poor citizen is the only loser.
Someone in Swat asked, "How are the Talibans?"  The answer is, "They are very good; they are fighting the war against the enemies of God."
A question about the army was answered, "Very good, it is fighting against the enemies of our country."
Then it was asked, "who are the enemies of religion and the country" and the answer was, "the citizens."
I am astonished how the Pakistani Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
Still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
First the girls schools and now the boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfews are in place so that the Taliban can move around easily.
Tonight eight trucks entered the suburbs of Mingora during curfew and created bunkers.
Question arises, how did they reach there during curfew?
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone convince the army to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the army can defeat any enemy.
He says that most of the blood is spilled in the name of religion. Tell me, if there was no religion, would blood not have spilled?
Are Punjabi, Pathan, White, Black, Mahsood and other tribes the result of religion?
No, sir, no way! Only religion teaches that there is no black and white, there is no Punjabi and no immigrant. If it were not for religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between the white and the black, and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribe-brotherhood hatred.
Actually, religion gives moral teachings to the man. And binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here. And he should spend his life according to his rules.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France for two years I also felt the same way.
I don't know why people always expect us to make calls. 
A resolution about Iraq passed in a few hours to send a "peace" force to Darfur was not a problem at all.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are consenting.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
Are people really waiting for it to finish?
In recent years the number of chemical and herbal health supplements has greatly increased in popularity, a major one of which is human growth hormone, commonly known as HGH.

If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
rather, you are a blemish on the name of humanity.
OK, it was proven that this area was also the home of the Israelis for thousands of years.
Ideally, these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection, but since their strings are in the hands of the western and Arab countries, peace is not possible without their will.
Now even Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
Even if operations in Israel are stopped for the time being, they will start again after some other incident.
The interests of BBC Homeland are affiliated with America and Israel and this is why it has produced a series of pro-Jewish blogs and is conducting one-sided and blatant 'propaganda' under the banner of 'broadmindedness'. 
BBC is only carrying the 'formality' and its objective is to have sympathies! 
Mr. Moderator is requested so he may publish the commentary by this humble soul so that one can guess BBC still has some integrity left.
Thanks. 
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How can he not realize that whatever is happening is showing the ugliest face of humanity
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.

At this time along with Dera Ghazi Khan, in whole country winter rains are going on.
Here is a poem for the season. Enjoy the rain with this poem.
It rains just because of you.
If it rains, it is spring.
When it stops there is no movement
Sometimes it comes without a reason.
Sometimes it spreads day and night.
Sometimes loudly, sometimes silently.
Even these rains are  from you
in some remembrance some night
to a buried ash
Sometimes, he put it out.
Sometimes, he lit himself up.
Sometimes every drop is painful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What it means to them is whether the country lasts or not.
Let the population sell toothpaste or clean the bells of the Mandir with the peels of lemons.
Our media is corrupted, like our leaders.
Its sole purpose is to extract money from the government.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday at noon a strange thing happened. 
All of the police were running here and there but was not the least concerned about illegal parking. 
Moreover, the NYPD was not in a mood to look at illegally parked cars.
It happened that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in the Hudson River.
Till today only this much is known, that the ""terrorist"" belonged to the family of birds called goose.
Yesterday was perhaps historically cold in New York.
The temperature does not fall this much.
My jaw started to ache because of walking outside for half an hour. 
Just imagine what would have happened to those who jumped off the plane into the river. 
The reason for their happiness is that all of them were safe.
The sad news is that the ship of company sank in this financial crisis.
I went by West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thanks God! During my hour trip the road was bit clear as I gof off on an exit from 56th street. 
I wasn't able to get off from two of the exits due to all the vehicles blocking the way. 
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, congratulations. Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women.
Shaguftah: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I had two chickens. It's a sacrifice. Janzeb will tell you how it was.
Besides this, there is no other way.
At this farm, one has to process his own meat, including removing the skin.

We unnecessarily kept thinking of these Taliban of Swat as indelicate, but who were only unhappy over women's education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
Like the majority of the ideas, this was not proven right. According to CNN news, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a boys school with gunpowder.
Swat: The Taliban has destroyed a boys' school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First".  I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation of the Taliban being against girls education is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Ameen Summa Ameen. 
By God's grace until now, 182 schools have been demolished. 
The custom, among Muslims, of fixing marriages before birth, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement made by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See the picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
Some days go, a girl's marriage with a dog become fresh.
Look at that groom.
Humanity is rare in the 21st century.
It is the era of computers and its involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life.
Lots of people have many reservations about this growing influence of computers, like in financial issues. 
Where use of credit cards bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
Now, with just a look at the credit card transaction record, your whereabouts can be traced.
In the future, less physical currency will be used, and its utility will increase. 
Similarly, in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, the credit card information is stolen.
Similarly friends are also made through computers.
Social networking sites such as Orkut, Facebook and Myspace have achieved an initial level of acceptance.
But do you not think that the more we are following these social networking sites, the we interact with people in real life?
Also consider match-making websites, where your preferences are matched to a list of people with similar desires as you.
Now can you spend your life with a person like you?
I can't do it, that is why a life partner is called my better half. 
That is because he/she may cover my deficiencies. 
Perhaps I received a lesser share of wisdom. 
Since childhood, whenever an elder said anything to me that was the truth for me.
In the same way, I was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world. 
I was even ridiculed a lot for this reason. 
But only that saying seemed true which could be possible.
I was always perplexed at the need to tell a lie. 
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
That is why I try to lie as little as possible.
That, I do not falsely please others, that too in the name of Allah.
and Allah willing say only when there is pray to Allah that work completes.
Allah always knows what is in their hearts. 
This is a despicable matter that rose due to distance from religion.
According to both our religion and Pakistani law, young children should stay with their mothers.
Their father is responsible for their financial needs and he may be allowed to see them. 
Then when the kids mature, they can live with anyone they want.
You are right that the actual problem is the relatives who misguide.
Jagirdar thinking on all of our deeds exercises. 
Thinking the same thing here working in the property of the father, a new parts and will be opposed the same otherwise his father, the process is commendable and counterfeiting. 
Here these restriction regarding relations have created many evils in the society.
Applying the concept of marriage to widows is rare. 
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason for family breakups.
Why is it in our society, if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarries, it is not appreciated?
A Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago,  had all his children married, but when he married a widow, his own children went against him.
In my opinion they have the right? What's your opinion? 
They said: "How could he consider having someone else take the place of our mother?"
In my opinion the children of this person should think that after having married all the kids, is there anything wrong in his marrying a widow? 
This widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
The children would definitely have gotten busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
If tomorrow their wives refuse to look after them, when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of pressure from society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society, which have been facing for the last 40-50 years.
A wife can accept her husband going around having illicit relations, but she can't stand him having a second wife.
If it's in her power, she will not let him do so even after she dies.
She destroys her husband and her own hereafter, and becomes a cause for spreading filthiness in society.
Nothing happens with the singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.
As for your question, the old man was going to the widow's house instead of bringing the widow to his house, so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax (though the stomach of the widow's children would hurt).
In IndopPak we embraced Islam centuries ago but can't get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then Islam. 
Thinking of a man's second marriage as an innovation, divorce as a clinical rest, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife, is all a part of this mentality.
Moreover, to copy western nations, we declare veil and worship backward. 
Accepting Islam was easy, getting rid of this way of thinking is very hard.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.

Ameer Taimur writes in his book, "I am Taimur,"  "I found the secret in my time alive that if the commander of any army is present on the front lines, then that army will never be defeated."
But here, the situation is different.
They say that common people are there to die for us and they die as martyrs.
Yet, if a common person dies it should be considered murder.
May peace and blessing of Almighty be upon you.
I was coming back to my shop after the Isha prayer tonight, a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called me.
I thought that probably this man has lost his way or wants to ask something, I stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked whether I could understand Arabic well or not. I said, no problem, tell me what you want.
He started to say that "I have come from Riyadh, to Madinah, but someone has pick-pocketed me, so please help me out." I asked him to excuse me, as such an incident had taken place with me previously, that I had given the person 20 Riyals to buy petrol to reach Riyadh, but he went a little ahead and started to ask somebody else.
Angrily, I cursed at him and threatened to call the police, so he ran away.
Now the situation has become that we Muslims come in cars with our families to beg all day, and gain at least two or three thousand illegally.
Whereas there is a clear Hadith of the Prophet (SAWS) that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand; the lower hand being the begging hand and the upper hand being the giving one.
May Allah bless us and make us true Muslims (Amen)

Famous singer Adnan Sami's wife reached a police station in Mumbai, accusing him of torturing her.
The police advised her to press charges and take the claim to court. 
Adnan Sami's wife, Saba Guladari, submitted a plea against her husband stating that Adnan Sami tortures her continuously.
and treats her inhumanely.
Now this thing has gone out of her tolerance, therefore, a case may be registered against Adnan Sami.
Since this case is not under the jurisdiction of the police, they asked her to consult the court. 
In your opinion, is the accusation against Adnan Sami, by his wife proper?
Or may this be another attempt by India to defame Adnan Sami? 
Let us know your opinion on this issue.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
As far as the allegations are concerned, anyone can make them against any other person. 
There's nothing more important than respect.
Whatever be the case between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he left his honorable life and went to India to earn money. Now that fame has fallen around his neck.
This is a result of his own actions.
Washington...
Top American officials say that president Obama will take a strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
In America's new policy for Afghanistan war has been given more importance than development.
The envoys say that Hamid Karzai is being considered a barrier in the achievement of American goals in Afghanistan, as there is corruption in government and the business of middlemen has increased while the Taliban are once more gathering strength.
The American officials also said that those people in the current administration who are pressuring Hamid Karzai to do more include Vice President Joe Biden and American Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrook. 
They stated that the policy change came after President Bush left office. The former president used to have video conferences with Hamid Karzai, and emphasized America's role in the rebuilding of Afghanistan and its civil institutions. 
Officials say that the Obama administration will work with state leaders as a backup to the main government.
They said that they will ask Hamid Karzai to intensify the campaign against corruption. 
Hamid Karzai is facing fresh elections this year and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his group will support Karzai for presidency or not.
Is this statement, of the American officials, a forecast of change in American policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is Hamid Karzai's rule coming to an end?
What is your opinion about this?
In a series of three one-day matches between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2 to 1.
In the first one-day match, Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka. However, Sri Lanka won the remaining two matches.
In the third match, the national cricket team's performance was very poor. In response to Sri Lanka's 309 runs, it only managed to hit 75 runs in 23 overs before going all out and suffering a humiliating defeat.
The result of the series shows the inconsistency of our cricket team's performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
Which aspects of the game should experts focus on?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
Which department will you blame for the defeat: fielding, batting or bowling?
Kindly share your opinion.
Malik Babar Husain, Jeddah. It is very sad that even in todays modern age, such ignorant traditions are prevalent. If the landlord or the property owner targets innocent people with his harsh dictatorship, who will call them Muslims?
Let any big shot walk on these burning coals. Why does the government allow them to do that?
When will we find justice through the courts?
The Sri Lankan cricket team arrived in Pakistan to play the one day international series.
Besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
On reaching Karachi Airport, the Sri Lankan team was given a warm welcome. 
Two matches will be held between Pakistan and Sri Lanka in Karachi, while the third one will be played in Lahore. 
Both teams are highly regarded for their batting, bowling and fielding. 
While the Sri Lankans are proud of their spinners, Pakistan has its fast bowlers.
Sri Lanka’s captain Mahela Jayawardene says that no one player but rather the Pakistan cricket team as a whole is to be a force to be reckoned with. 
Muralidharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, while Pakistan’s captain says that this competition will be tough. 
Shoaib Malik has said that we have played Murlidharn and will see Mendas as well.  They have developed a secret game plan which they will show at the ground.
Will the Pak-Sri Lanka series be really as interesting and exciting as the claims are?
Who will have the upper hand when the series between Pakistan and Sirilanka gets underway?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Give your opinion.
Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.

It is all these people's doing Kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years.
No one asks about that now that they have stuck with fundamentalism and fight for terrorism. They now start talking about a deal.
First they killed Muslims brutally, and now they are trying to resolve issues.
Pakistan has tried to understand their two-way policy.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating this situation to distract the world attention away from the Kashmir issue.
Pakistan always shows the truth of India to the world.
Now the British government has realized that the Indian government is maligning Pakistan for terrorism so that it can occupy Kashmir.
They hesitate to talk to Pakistan over this issue.
British foreign minister David Miliband said that resolving the Kashmir issue will end extremism. The Pakistan government will be able to handle the border issues.
It should be noted that American President Obama has already expressed similar views on the Kashmir issue.
British foreign minster has said that even though the fight against terrorism is dangerous, for their own safety they chose to fight.
David Miliband has said that Pakistan should show leniency towards extremist groups.
Is India purposefully creating uncertainity in the region to avoid the resolution of Kashmir issue by world stakeholders? 
Are the Mumbai attacks the part of this plan? 
Does India want to avoid the comprehensive talks by on the basis of terrorism? 
Tell us your opinion.

I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
They in fact are thinking of ways to control Pakistan because they know Pakistan is an atomic power.
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries are thinking that if Pakistan is cornered that will pose more political and geographical problems. They want to help Pakistan so they can achieve their vested interests.
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is a Ram.
I think that they get problems often in a while and they start threatning Pakistan.    I believe they often find themselves in difficulties and then begin threatening Pakistan. 
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.

Raas Al Khaima, It is due to America that wrong statements are being given , America is out of its mind but now India is also doing the same, India should try attacking , then it will become crystal clear that who stands where.

The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden, played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.

All decisions will be made in the Parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.

Zubeer Khan, Karachi
This is very hurtful incident that Israel is publicly massacring the Palestinians, same situation is here in Kashmir but Security Council do not even bother about it.
All groups in Kashmir and Palestine should keep the war for freedom going. They should unitedly fight all forces that oppose them. God willing, a day will come when their martyrdom will bear fruit. 
Israeli air attacks still continues in Gaza, since now several Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
The important Political Person of HAMAS Nazariyan has killed along with his family.
Here the Security Council meeting concluded without any decision.
The conference was conducted against Isreal by Libya and other gulf countries, and the report was submitted to America
Israeli airplanes bombardment has continued since it's many days spent in the Palestinian civil population. 
The whole world reacted on Mumbai attacks, but no countries including America and England can see the bloodshed caused by Israeli attacks. 
Why are the important Islamic countries quiet?
What is your opinion on these double standards of the world?
Saeed, New York.
I think that actually, most of our people are illiterate. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties. The electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has taken a serious position.
On the other hand, the price of gas has been increased by 18%. Due to unavailability of petrol, people are facing severe difficulties.
The business and industrial communities of Pakistan are violently protesting the power and gas crisis.
The producers have given the ultimatum to close the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is annoyed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
Production has become practically paralyzed.
The government institutions are blaming each other to express their positions.
Increasing the prices of electricity and gas is not a joke with people. 
Why did not pay attention to solve these problems?
The government is not working to improve the situation.
What are your suggestions to fix these problems?
Let us know of your opinions.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that government is carrying slogan of public service is itself hurting them.
The the lack of available electricity, gas and petrol has become torturous.
The government has no control over the institutions.
The law and order situation is getting worse, day to day. May Allah have mercy on this country.
The new year has started.
The previous year was a year of protests and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered for terrorism.
We will also remember the removal of President Musharraf from power, the end of President Bush's eight-year regime, Bush having shoes thrown at him, the establishment of a democratic government in Pakistan, sudden calamities, the earthquake of Balochistan, and the terrible global financial crisis.
Now that the new year has arrived, how do you think it will go?
From your what geopolitical conditions will be the policy of Obama? 
Is there any hope of moving towards the eradication of terrorism?
Will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?
What turn will the Indo-Pak relations take?
Is there a chance of a surgical strike or full scale war?
What expectations do you have for the new year?

I remember an interview of Adnan Sami in which he said that he is not a Pakistani national but a British subject.
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan at the first opportunity, because he did not get honor over there either.
Farid Ahmad

After the Mumbai attacks, the mode of the Indians has changed.
Jagjit Singh reacted by expressing that he hates Pakistan and Pakistanis.
It should be known that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsle. How has he become helpless now? Adnan Sami should stay in India. There is no need for him to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam
Karachi. I will only say this about Jagjit Singh: he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! Open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Mumbai attack their feeling of hate has increased.Now they are talking against the famous singer Adnan Sami. 
According to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said ""You dog this is a farewell kiss""
After this, the journalist took his shoe off and threw it at Bush. President Bush ducked with expertise and saved himself from getting hit by the shoe.
The second shoe hit the American flag.
Security personnels dragged the journalist away from there.
On this occasion, President Bush said that he did not know why he did that.  The shoe was size ten, he was not bothered.
In your opinion, does this action of the journalist show the anger of the Iraqi public against President Bush?
What do you think about this incident?

Our rulers should understand that they are fighting their own people who are willing to bear the hardships for thier love for Pakistan. 
If a war occurs, then they will fight for Pakistan. 
You cannot simply condemn politics in this case.  I think between these two things, a war is very likely.
