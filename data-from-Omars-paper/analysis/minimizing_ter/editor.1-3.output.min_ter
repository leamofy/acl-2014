'First Nuclear Experiment was conducted in 1990'
Thomas Reid, who has worked in the Lever National Laboratory in America as a weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the former director of technical intelligence at Los Alamos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.
This book was titled "Nuclear Express: Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation," and both writers have claimed that whichever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or had the support of another nuclear power.
in an interview with US news, Thomas Reed said that in 1990, during the rule of Benazir Bhutto, China texted Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Thomas Reid said that, for many reasons, he believes that China had tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
The reasons include the design of the bomb and some information gained during talks with the Chinese scientists.
He further added that this was the reason that in 1998 in a span of only two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments in response to Indian nuclear experiments.
Thomas Reid reminds us that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiments.
He further said that atomic bomb test Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998 was made with extreme care, and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.
When Thomas Reeds was questioned about China providing nuclear technology to Pakistan he replied that India was a common enemy for Pakistan and China.
He said that there is a proof that Doctor Abdul Qadeer Khan used Chinese designs, and the documents which were acquired from Libya confirm this statement.
On an additional question about whether doing combined nuclear tests is common then he said that in 1990, America conducted a nuclear test for Britain on an open belt in Nevada desert.
He said that he also assumed that Israel was given access to the results of this test.
Thomas Reed was also questioned whether the Chinese nuclear spread program is continuing?
On this, Thomas Reed said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and design to a nuclear facility in Iran's city Isfahan since 1990.
China also provided Iran a nuclear enrichment plant.
He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen through North Korea.

Protest against the siding of Journalists.
I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must spiral down a militaristic stairway into the hall of thermonuclear destruction. I believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality.
I believe that even amid today's mortar bursts and whining bullets, there is still hope for a brighter tomorrow. I believe that wounded justice, lying prostrate on the blood flowing streets of our nation can be lifted from this dust of shame or reign supreme among the children of men.
I have the audacity to believe that people everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits.
This faith will give us courage to face the uncertainties of the future. It will give our tired bodies new strength as we advance toward the city of freedom.
When our days become dreary with low-hovering clouds and our nights become darker than a thousands midnights, we will know that we are living in the creative turmoil of a genuine civilization.
With the richness and variety of bird life, there are brilliant discoveries to be made by any bird watcher who has the requisite enthusiasm and perseverance.
In truth, there is little danger from an elephant unless it is a rogue or a female with a small calf.
I still believe that one day mankind will bow down before the altars of god and be crowned triumphant over war and bloodshed,and that non-violent redemptive will be proclaimed the rule of the land. The lion and the lamb shall lie down together and every man shall sit under his own vine.
I was also asked how I could subsist on the little food I ate during my meals. This knowledge was obtained by watching me eat till i mustered enough courage to shut the kitchen door.
The villagers were curious about me, and strange as it may seem, I had not anticipated it. It usually showed itself in their asking me direct questions.

Apart from this, well number three was destroyed yesterday in an explosion, and a gas pipe line was harmed by another explosion near Allah Yaar Hill.
The responsibility for these blasts were claimed by the spokesperson for the banned organization, Baloch Republican Army, Sarbaz Baloch.
From the beginning of the year 2009, there was an increase in the number of extremist incidents.
In this month, there were dozens of incidents of gas pipes being blown up, and there was also an increase in attacks on trains and people from the state of Punjab.
Though the Chief Minister of Balochistan, Nawab Aslam Raeesani, expressed distress over these incidents, and the police were instructed to share information with intelligence agencies, but it still wasn't possible to stop these incidents.
The 819 trillion Dollar economic reform package was accepted.
No member from the Republican party voted for this plan supported by President Obama.
The Republican party said that this economic plan was very expensive and that it would not be successful.
In The House of Representatives, 240 votes were cast in favor of the plan, while 188 votes were cast against it.
This economic reform plan has to be presented in the Senate next week, where the ruling Democratic party has a significant majority.
It is feared that due to opposition from the Republican party, its passing in the senate may not be easy.
After the passing of the economic reform plan the house, Barack Obama said to the members that they should not let political differences get in the way of this important plan.
The President said that plan, which he hoped would become law by next month, would prove helpful in creating a suitable environment in the country for business would prosper.

Bitterness Between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister.
Rajab Tayb Urdan vehemently said to the Israeli President that much blood has been spilt in Gaza and he felt ashamed that people were applauding the military actions in Gaza.
Mr. Urdan has said that "I feel that you are using such words in order to hide your guilt but you have killed those children and I am mourning the death of those killed at sea side."
Shamon Perez has said that Gaza's incident was not due to Israel but was Hamas, by creating a dangerous dictatorship.
Davis CA, correspondent of BBC has said that world economic forum has never seen such incident before.
Afterwards Urdan said that he respected the Israeli President and his age because of which he shouted at him but what he was saying was far from the truth.
Turkey is one of few Muslim countries which has diplomatic ties with Israel, but there has been acrimony between the two countries for the last few years.
Attacks were planned in Pakistan
Wajid Shams UL Hassan tells the NDTV that Pakistan will soon publish the investigative report on the Mumbai Attacks.
Last year 170 people lost their life in the Mumbai Attacks.
Now India is holding the Lashkar-i-Taiba, an extremist outfit responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
India also claim that non-governmental Pakistani actors also have a role in the Mumbai attacks.
Pakistan-India relationships are badly hurt by the Mumbai attacks.
High Commissioner Wajid Shams Ul Hassan gave a statement in press that gives a clue about what investigative report may contain.
Wajid Shams-ul-Hasan said that the investigative report denied that Pakistani soil has been used.
That can be any other country but not the Great Britain.
These two places (Pakistan and Britain )were what I have conscious of.
Indian and the international world put too much pressure on Pakistan to take action against those responsible for the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan said that it took action against many people who are possibly behind the Mumbai attacks and dozens of people have been arrested.
Wajid Sahms Ul Hassan said, "We are not trying to hide this."
We believe in acting on reality.
our investigation will be accepted by the world.
We (through investigation) will try to satisfy India by evidence.
He defended the delaying of Pakistani investigation said that these type of clues take time to gather, understand, and investigate.
Commissioner Wajid Shams Ul Hassan said that India took 45 days to show his dossier.
Republican Leader Also Elected Red Indian

People say that from the five candidates who stood for the position of the chairmanship of the Republican party, Michael Steel was considered the most conservative among them.
After his win, Michael Steel said in his speech "We are saying to our friends and enemies together, come with us, but those who will cause problems in this, be prepared to separate from us." Michael Steel is from Maryland, where he has also been the deputy governor.
He became famous in 2006 when he ran for a seat in the senate.
But after losing in the Senate elections, he was appointed as the chairman of one political conservative committee of the party.
Now that he has been selected as party chairman, the Republicans' nationwide campaign efforts will be under his supervision.
He fought elections promising that he will give the party a new cause and use new approaches to add conservative supporters to the party.
India Claims Presence of Lashker-e-Tayyaba and Josh-e-Muhammad in Jammu.
There are reports that terrorists are present in the Poonch tribal area of Jammu.
According to official sources, on receiving secret information, police and army have surrounded the area and begun a search.
In this period, small fights ensued in which four militants, two soldiers and one police agent were killed.
According to sources these fights were going on until the last reports received, and Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad militants are present in these regions, to fight with whom more army battalions were sent there.
Meanwhile, the Chief Minister selected by the joint government, Umar Abdullah, met with the governor and informed him about his being selected the leader of his party, the National Conference in the assembly.
The allied party of the National Conference, the Congress also informed the governor of their support for Umar Abdullah.
Umar Abdullah will be administered the oath as the Chief Minister of the State tomorrow.
Note that in the recently held state elections the National Conference got 28 out of the 87 seats of the parliament, thus becoming the largest party. It should be clear that separatist groups boycotted the elections.
The Congress party, which got 17 seats, was prepared to form a joint government with the National Conference.
Today, upon reaching Srinagar, Umar Abdullah was jubilantly greeted by the party members.
On this occasion, Umar Abdullah said that he would try to play a role in generating dialog between the Indian government and separatists. However, this would not be possible until the elections took place and the new government came to power in India.
The Role of the European Union in Peace Making in the Middle East.
If looked at from a government perspective, the diplomatic efforts going on to stop the Middle East War are most decisive.
According to the state policy of Brussels, the efforts of the Shwarzenburg delegation or those of Sarkozy, are similar to giving a helping hand.
The spokesperson of the European Commission, Amadeu Altafaj, said that every effort which helps advancing the joint message of the European Union to the two parties is welcome.
As far as the state policy is concerned, everyone seems alright.
However, in reality, the European Union is in a sad state of internal differences.
As the President of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is weak.
On top of that, internal fighting has made it all the more helpless.
On the other hand, French President Sarkozy's demeanor suggests that he is the president of the Union.
France has completed its 6 month presidency period.
Sarkozy wants to play a presidential role, and he is able to, but he does not have the permission to do so.
The most ridiculous situation faces the foreign minister of France, Bernard Kouchner.
He is part of the delegation, which is being headed by Schwarzenberg, the Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic.
What's worse, both the foreign ministers are giving different statements about the war in the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself, whereas according to Kouchner this war does not come under defense policy. On the other side, Germany has also sent its special ambassador to the Middle East. The European Union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues.
Its evidence is the reaction of Israel, which does not give any importance to the conciliation efforts of the EU.
EU has a golden chance of getting something done because America has lost in the Middle East due to the policies of George Bush.
Economic Setback: Suicide of German Billionaire Industrialist
Adolf Meerklay, residing in the area of Sawabia in southern Germany, has  left a great business group behind him.
But earlier common German citizens did not know much about him.
Later when he had to conference, about the loan given to his industrial group, with almost 30 banks for many weeks, he also became topic of the headlines. And he could see a dark future of Meerklay groups.
The Merkel Group had to suffer financial losses of many millions of Euro after its investment to buy shares of German auto maker Volkswagen.
Then monetary institutions canceled this groups loan amounting to 700 million and another 1 billion Euro that it necessarily required and hence Merkel came into extreme pressure.
Some time back, the bank agreed to provide Merkel Group an emergency loan. But, Adolf Merkel,who raised a small industrialist group to the position of a strong industrial group whose annual income was approximately 30 billion Euro, could not bare the loss in his investment capability.
Adolf Merkel started managing the business and modernize it after the death of his parents. The business under his supervision became very popular and became more strong.
He named his company Ratiopharm, which is today Germany's very large acclaimed and successful pharmaceutical company.
Some time back, the commercial value of this company was in between 5 and 6 billion Euro and still was earning a revenue of 8.1 billion Euro annually. After the great success of Ratiopharm, the Merkel Group acquired many big businesses, which included building materials makers. Hydelberg cement to modified/special car maker Kassbohrer company.
The workforce of Merkel Group is nearly about 100,000 throughout the world and its assets include Ratiopharm, which always was the most important business in the portfolio.
Adolf Merkel, during his lifetime, expressed the view that it has been four generations that we have been in pharmaceutical business.
Now the management of this institution is with my children and I hope this institution will be managed by and in possession of my family for few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, the banks have provided approval for temporary loans of 400 million Euro for VEM Group, but added the condition that VEM should sell off Ratiopharm to improve the financial situation for a long term sustainability.
Likewise after the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain as it was.
Crime rate among the immigrants in Germany
According to the fresh statistics, crime rate among the immigrants from 2004 to 2007 is
Reduced from 9.22%
to 4.21%
According to Joachim Herrmann, the Bavarian Interior Minister, this would appear to be a positive change.
He said: "It is important to note that the number of foreigners getting German citizenship is increasing."
Therefore this should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German, his background is foreign.
Herrmann said that his province will take this into account when gathering statistics in 2010.
Besides Bavaria, Hamburg is also thinking  along the same lines.
The internal affairs senator related with the matters of CDU, Cristoph said, "When research is done in a scientific manner, Ahlhaus, man can not bring about its required results as it wills, but rather, it depends on the numbers and statistics that come out from the research".
Ahlhaus referred to a state-wide objective reporton crime prevention,which was prepared in 2006. The report indicated what percent of the people committing crimes from Bergdorf to Hamburg were foreigners.
From the results, it became clear that the foreigners there
had a lower crime percentage than the crimes taking place in the whole state.
Contrary to this, during 2006, when the percentage of youngsters committing crimes was calculated, it became evident that the youngsters from a foreign background committing crime was 44
.7 percent.
However, the various German political parties such as SPD, environmentalist party, grains, and left wing party, Linkspartei, are against the collecting of crime statistics of German citizens with a foreign background.

The history of civilization shows how man always has to choose between making the right and the wrong use of the discoveries of science. This has never been more true than in our own age.
In a brief period amazing discoveries have been made and applied to practical purposes. It has become platitude to say we are living in an age of revolution. It would be ungrateful not to recognize how immense are the boons which science has given to mankind. It has brought within reach multitudes of benefits and advantages which, only a short time ago, were the privilege of the few. It has shown how malnutrition, hunger and disease can be overcome.
It has not only lengthened life but it has deepened its' quality. Fields of knowledge, experience and recreation often in the past only to a few, have been thrown open to millions.
But the gifts of modern science can be misused.
Through science, an everyday man of today has been given the opportunity of a longer and fuller life than was ever possible to his grandparents. We must acknowledge all that science has done and is doing for the welfare of our racem but the gifts of modern science can be misused.
The car, a motor-driven vehicle, facilitates business and gives harmless enjoyment to many, but it has caused more causalities in one year in this country alone.
The cinema is a means of instruction and recreation opening magic casements, but it is often a channel of vulgarity and false values.
The wireless can link the world together in a moment of time, but it can also be the instrument of lying propaganda. The aeroplane makes travel rapid and easy.
It can also become a weapon of destruction. It is this two-fold aspect of the methods to which science can be applied that has raised a valid concern to most people.
It is morally justifiable to see a supposedly perfect invention a possible means of destruction.

Tea: an Effective Cure for Breast Cancer
According to a new research, three cups of tea a day
can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age, by more than a third.
In research carried out by the Moffitt Cancer Institute, in the American state of Florida, it was revealed that the risk of occurrence of breast cancer tumors in women below the age of 50 years
who drink at least three cups of tea a day is reduced by up to 37%.
It was also revealed in the research that there was no significant benefit, in the woman over the age of 50, who drank three or more cups of tea a day.
Experts believe that the reason for this is that tea has ingredients in it, which are more effective against specific tumors which generally occur in women below the age of 50.
The Moft Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, studied 5,000 women who had taken the treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 70 years.
The experts compared their medical record and life pattern with that of women who were safe from breast cancer.
The experts also found out that on a particular type of cancer, Lobular, tea had shown a great effect and it reduced by 66 percent.
Almost every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type of it.
This type of cancer is more dangerous because it originates deep inside the breast tissue, and is usually diagnosed when it has already spread to a great extent.
Experts say that by drinking at least three cups of tea a day, the danger of breast cancer can be reduced in young women.
They say that making tea a regular drink in daily life can cause great resistance in the body against breast cancer.
In Britain every year almost 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer.
The Afghan war is the greatest challenge faced by America : Gates.

Why the Reduction of Exercise with Increasing Age?
New research
Exercise is good at every age to remain healthy.
It makes your heart stronger, reduces cholesterol levels, helps control weight, helps in limiting diabetes and slows the Alzheimer's process.
Unfortunately, with many people with increasing age reduces the ability to exercise.
Experts says with exercise our body and brain remains alert, yet aging can affect it.
According to American Medical Association, if exercise is excluded from daily life there can be many health problems that can develop in the future.
Dr. Patricia P. Leka of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says that an increase in age is a big reason for man's decrease in exercise and physical activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.
She headed a research trial regarding heart diseases and the ability to participate in exercise in older age.
A team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart
in which it's activity of pumping blood and its contraction and relaxation was studied.
Researcher focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.
They came to know ,that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.
Dr. Patricia says as individuals age, problems occur in the relaxation of heart which affects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research.
He says that they were surprised to see that it has an effect, as it confirmed that poor exercising ability is closely related to the heart's relaxation phase.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause disorders in heart functions and heart disease.
If the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard, then they can take advantage of the benefits of exercise even with age.
A detailed report in this matter is published in a magazine of the American Medical Association.
No Chances of an Immediate War with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief
Indian Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor has said that there is no chance of an immediate war with Pakistan, but that India is always ready to defend our country and sacrifice our lives for it.
He has stated that despite the commitments and international pressure on Pakistan as a result of the attacks in Mumbai, the infrastructure of terrorism not only exists but is also proactive in Pakistan.
He said this while talking to correspondents in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day tour of the valley of Kashmir in order to analyze both the overall security situation in New Delhi administered Kashmir and the preparation of armed forces on the borders.
He was asked his thoughts on media reports that Pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from India regarding the Mumbai attacks.
General Kapoor said that decisions in matters of peace or war are made by the political leadership.
Mentioning the proven presence of a terrorist structure in Pakistan, he said that the Indian army would face such groups which are trying to disturb peace and are bent towards weakening India.
He said that in Indian Kashmir, at least 700 to 800 militants were present, of which approximately half were foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that with an improvement in the seasonal weather, there might be an increase in infiltration from Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. However, India has increased the guard at the borders.
He refuted the possibility of decrease in the army posting in Kashmir, saying that there can be no compromise with regards to national security.
May Allah bless the tongues of the world and may Barack become a blessing for the world.
Though it was not expected, still we shall see how this change  will work out in our favor with regards to Pak-American relations.
We shall also see what Barack Obama, who is the result of Martin Luther King's dreams, gives to the world.
Obama, part of whose name is Husain, taking the oath today, as the American President, is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance, but also a historic test.
Not only for himself, but also for all the people who supported him.
It will even be a test for the white majority, as for them to accept from their hearts, a black governing over them is no easy task.
Here in South Asia, the Muslims which have some expectations from Obama, should remember that Obama has been elected the president of America. Obama should remember that America is practically  the president of whole world.
After a while, a person whose ancestors were slaves and bought from different regions of the world, is going to become the 44th president of America.
Many people have many expectations of this man.
Obamas fans should not expect something unrealistic from him.
If Obama becomes successful in decreasing the religious and racial acrimony, it will be a victory for his fans.
How South Asia will be affected by this change, and can there be any meaningful change in American policies?
How will Pakistan and America's relationship will be affected by this change.

The Presence of Obama or others does not matter because the strong Jewish lobby is the real authority which decides the policy and types of relations with other world.
As far as Pakistan is concerned, after the Mumbai attacks the world saw the triad of America, India and Israel respond aggressively.
Even for a while, after Pakistan was formed, the managing of Swat was left to the Ruler of Swat, who had his own army and law.
They surrendered their rule to the government of Pakistan, according to a treaty.
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a step mother.
There has been no increase in the number of schools in Swat since the rule of the Ruler of Swat was ended.
Nor was there any interest in the construction and development over there.
The number of girls receiving education in the present rule is a lot less than their number in the previous rule.
In the Sarhad state of Pakistan, the local Taliban have been targeting the educational institutions.
The most schools were destroyed in Swat province, of which the majority were the girls schools.
Not only this, but the Taliban have announced the prohibition of girls education in Swat.
Thousands of boy's and girl's are being deprived of education.
What do you think the Taliban have to gain by eradicating the education of women?
Why has the government been unsuccessful in stopping these illegal steps?
What do you think the government should do?
The question should be, what do the ISI and Pakistani agencies get?
Because the people of Swat have realized this was a game and that the army was there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them. Otherwise, how could five schools be blown up in a single curfew night? How could people be slaughtered during curfew and hung in the center of the town?
When the government is not being allowed to have any say in Swat, how can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps?
Now, the question arises as to how, when the government has an armed military, new and dangerous weapons, new technology and spy system etc., these four Taliban elements are not being controlled?
The answer to this is that they have the hand of a hidden guide on their heads, because of which neither their weapons get exhausted nor do they get captured.
The conclusion is that the Taliban, through their dark activities, are making the work of the global leadership easier.
Fifteen years ago, the war was on in Afghanistan.
The ISI was controlling the Taliban while on the opposing side the Northern Coalition was being aided by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly the scenario changed and the activities of the Taliban came to light.
The ISI also was offered financial aid by the Americans which resulted in past friends becoming foes.
Now the scenario is that the war is still raging but the supporters in Pakistan are still the same Iran, India, and Russia.
Until mankind can understand the difference between whats right and whats wrong he will always make the wrong decision.
For example, if a thief intends to commit a crime, realizes it's wrong he will also fear his Lord and then he will not commit the crime.
Similarly, unless and until Israel understands that it is doing the wrong thing by shedding the blood of innocent people in Gaza and that it will be punished, it will continue to kill innocent people there.
Greetings!
The question is if war or aggression the answer to the Terrorist issue?
If not, then what is the solution?
It is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but adds 'blessings' to them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development that Nelson Mandela used in South Africa.
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
From the Kashmiris taking part in the elections, it looks as if they have accepted this view point.
It is the third week of Israel's attacks on Gaza and the number of deaths have gone close to a thousand.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date, a ceasefire was not possible.
According to another report, since the attacks began on December 27, 90,000 Palestinians have left their homes and moved to a safer location.
Aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, saying that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victims of severe psychological and emotional problems.
What are you saying?
What should happen?
How is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Give Taliban a Chance.
Basit, Peshawar
Wake up! If the Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down the girls schools?
They will be kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
These Taliban have damaged Islam so much that no other nation or religion has done.
Pushtun force
Kohat, Pakistan
If the entire Muslim world gets together and even just threatens Israel, you will see how much Israel's daddy, America, will get hurt.
And not only will theere be immediate talks of ceasefire, an actual ceasefire will occur.
But what can be done, where can our leaders get so much courage?
Someone should tell Ahmedinejad that he should take the lead, as BBC forum's are full of discussion of his bravery.
The responsibility for establishing peace and human rights falls not only upon the Arabs or the Muslims of the world, but rather it is the duty of all the nations in the world to speak up against oppression.
This troubling incident is one of the worst misdeeds of Bush to date.
On June 30th, before the close of the financial year in Pakistan and India, the government institutions are looted, in the same way. Similarly, before the winding up of the American government, Israel was given the green signal to do whatever it wants.
On one hand, America says that it will try for a ceasefire.
On the other hand, the United Nations is passing resolution after resolution, but all have been futile. This only cements the idea that the UN is a party to Muslim oppression.
All Muslim countries should immediately revoke their United Nations membership and lay foundation for a united Muslim Union.
There are many evident examples of America and the United Nations only promising and passing resolutions. In the end, it is the Muslims who suffer.
What is the use of such propaganda, when the BBC doesn't even publish the matter?
Now where are all the ideals of journalism buried? When unjustified bloodshed, especially of a Muslim, occurs, BBC takes a neutral position.
by the way is a flag bearer of rights
to raise voice is a far reality, the limit of hypocrisy is that it doesn't even publish the views
from the Muslim side
The only difference in you and the Jews is that the latter call themselves Jews, they martyr Muslims and live amongst Muslims like you they call themselves Muslims
syja786
For a long time, BBC forums have been using a certain word, sometimes while discussing suicide attacks and other times, while discussing terrorism in India.
The most used word in these anti-Islamic comments is extremism.
But who is the extremist? That you can easily figure out from the above comment.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal cannot be fought with the sword?
Looking at the helpless people facing the Israel bombings, if the heart does not cry, what does it do?
But the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that we try to use the name of Jihad to disfigure the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existence of Israel, what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks?
The conduct of both sides is misanthropic.
The action of the United Nations and the United States seem to be supporting the Israeli wrongdoings.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
And we should think about giving the real terrorists an anti-terrorism Nobel prize for their painstaking efforts against terrorism, as after all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, would it be possible for terrorism to take place at such a large scale without the support of some big leader? And everyone knows who is controlling the strings.
In easy words, such gangsters are told to do whatever they want.
What a forceful act, hit on the head, and do not allow to cry.
The medicines for the injured, the shroud and compensation for  the dead are being given by the Arab rulers, and the question is,
Israeli attacks, what should happen?
The actual problem is that the leaders of all the Muslim countries, including the Saudi king, are in a deep sleep. They neither have an army nor any protective plans. They think they can support and fulfill their responsibility.
They should take immediate action against Israel.
For instance, they could stop the sale of oil to Europe and America.
Salams to all sisters and brothers.
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is similar to considering them defeated.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature. The steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Israel and Hamas should enter a truce so that the death and destruction can come to an end.
Mohammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France
Absolutely correctly stated
Suppose that Hamas is 100% truthful, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah.  Even then, they should know that if a good deed results in the destruction of an established house, it is no longer a good deed.
For those who claim to love God, love the messenger, and love their religion, loving mankind is a part of their faith.
As if it is the order of Allah to evacuate all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than the Muslims.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
The order is not to kill them but to invite them to Islam.
Towards those people who plan against the religion, there is the order to perform Jihad against them.
To fight them until they stop their plans, but this does definitely not mean that you wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the end result of killing innocent children is destruction.
But I would like to tell my friends that yesterday the Israelis did not have any place for shelter. Today, they have become so strong that they do not listen to anyone. This is because the Jews are one.
They do not have Shia or Sunni. They are all just Jews, and they have made everything for development.
What is the state of the 55 Islamic countries?
They are behind in every field, and now the situation is that they have become so helpless that the enemy is killing them and they are waiting to die.
The need is for all the Muslim countries to get together and prepare a plan of action against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
There is no better course of action then accepting Israel progress.  It is best to Learn new technologies and ways to be success and let the world live in peace.
Muslims have great land and resources.
The need is correct usage.
First of all, the most tragic part is that Hammas and Alfatah could not be united.
The only reason to destroy great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin was to weaken the only nation fighting for Aqsa Mosque. It was impossible until Yasir and Yasin were removed out of the way.
The world has seen how Palestine was effected after the death of these two leaders.
While the lobby of jews strengthened their target by every moment.
In 1974, a Pakistani Prime minister was in such world power that he led all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100% attendance for the first time in history.
Today on his 81st birthday it is still hard for this nation to make a promise on whether it will unite itself or not.
By resolving Muslims conflicts, the Islamic Commonwealth Establishment will give plunge to its uncompleted mission.
this is that jinn which lap to Palestinian since more than half century
this jinn have many face.
many time this jinn on his some other face give a bad remarks for his own self to turn back worlds pressure and concentration.
and this jinn other face eating peoples in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
and this jinn have a big fear of Islam, as this jinn knows that when ever he pull out this only and only by Islam Muslims and Muslims complete religion and act of Islam pull out because history said that Islam put on right track many biggest Abujahal.
Israels fighter jets start bombarding on Gaza and launched missile attacks on the 27th of December.
In this attack, more than three hundred residents have died.
After the air attacks, Israeli tanks and bulletproof vehicles prepared for war via land and reached Gaza.
United Nations Security Council, on its emergency gathering, agreed to a  statement asking for immediate stop of violent activities from Israel and Palestine.
Israel official said that they will continue action in Gaza until the rocket attacks on Israel end.
What should Israel do in order to defend them self? Will their action work?
What is the international community to do?
Does this intense action link to Israels upcoming next election?
What does newly elected President Barack Obama say after his past position on the middle east?

Palestine is the holiest place for Muslims and its safety is our necessary duty.
We have to remember that this is our first Qiblah.
and Israel India and America would have to finish. because this country exist for breaking up, soon God definitely give them doom Sajid Sadiq, Lahore.
When has the night of loneliness been spent shedding tears?
When has a calamity been averted only by supplication? (Nawab Zadah Nasrullah Khan)
BBC searches for such comments and publishes them.
After all, it has to keep up the flag and perception of non-alignment.
As such, the news on BBC is usually true, but the main thing is the tone.
In the news what should be highlighted and what should be given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
In this practice, our Pakistani Wire-net media, in particular some columnists and newspapers are not far behind any more, as they are writing with courage against the growing extremism and terrorism and stressing a lot upon "Muawiyah hate".
He said that the United Nations speaks of human rights and peace, but though the Muslims ar being oppressed greatly, you hear them say that until Hamas does not stop its attacks, this unfair policy will continue.
Why Muslims are getting abused, if country like America will leave the back support of Jews then Allah has said clearly that this caste will spend there life contemptible and this caste can not spend there life good,  if American Citizens have the guts to leave the back support of Jews then see the fortune of the life of Jews
The people who are killing and murdering people in the name of peace and justice have to understand this clearly: that in this world, peace will come only by administering an oath, not by doing injustice and dissemination.
If only by doing dissemination you can kill the caste and want to withdraw the results what you want, then after Hitlers measure not only the Jews caste was continued but in one way the ascent as today was impossible
In the Words of the poet
Abuse is again an abuse if it gets greater, then it will be erased.
Blood is again a blood if it falls down, then it will freeze.
Now who will say to whom what is terrorism?
Why all this does not come under Terrorism, why only our pain seems to be like every ones pain
Are other people not human beings or only Muslims blood has become so cheap, isn't blood of an innocent not red in color?
Now from any where why the condolence message is not coming?
I watched the Mumbai incident, and felt as if my own house was on fire. The sorrow of those affected was overwhelming. If only there was a solution to this war.
How can words describe the bodies strewn on the streets, helpless,innocent people, injured and soaked in blood?
I feel like crying about the helplessness of Muslims, that on one side, people are dying in India, and the whole world is climbing onto Pakistan, without any proof and saying, take action or else we will.
And on the other side, Israel is ruthlessly killing Muslims and the whole world is silent. This is unbearable.
There is delay, but no darkness, with God. That too, when this darkness comes to pass.
Danger to Israel, with America present, is a joke.
As for elections, there is no doubt, to gain public support, such actions will have to be taken for the sake of power, especially in a state like Israel. As for Barack Obama, history is witness that no American ruler has been able to go against the American policy and nor will they go. Whether the ruler is white or black, he is still a ruler.
From the discussions going on in the forum, it seems that everyone is hurt over her death, but as a politician, her mistakes have not been ignored.
This issue is debatable, as to whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was dearer, why did she leave the republic for ten years in the control of Musharraf, waiting for American clearance and deal?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the people needed her the most.  Unfortunately, she came to Pakistan when she had to deal with cases and was promised a seat of power.
The blames that are being laid down on historical figures are not addressed by anyone.
Sana Khan
Some things are over looked under these circumstances but nothing can be done.
One more Kari
Ladies and gentlemen, maybe due to studying the history, in not only Pakistan, but its four friend-nations and seven other nations, you find the arguments of Mr Psycho more appealing.
Tariq Ayyaz
Those who don't deserve such education shouldn't get it either.
The reflection of the pine in water never got to be green.
Britain never allowed the two to be united and always came up with a new Hindu-Muslim conflict which was looked after by Sir Syed.
Psycho
How merciless is our nation? We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party, but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.
We have succeeded a lot!
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored, thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar if you en wreathe him with books.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks, Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.
If they talk about war, then both sides will suffer human loss.
India says that a Pakistani citizen is caught in Bombay attacks. He has written and sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. But earlier, when India caught this extremist, said that he is a smart engineer, but later they declared him to have studied only four grades. This is what has to be considered.
First of all, Merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and all our Christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
We do not want the flames of fire; but the flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
Does war solve problems?
It will bless with fire and blood.
It will cause hunger and desperation.
Therefore, wise people,
it's better to avoid war,
in our own backyards.
It's better that the glim keeps lightened
The India-America relations have deepened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
This is that the old history of America.
Because in the case of an Indian attack, America's goals will also be fulfilled but the expenses will be India's.
Pakistan should clearly announce that it will not start a war, but if injury is caused, there will be no talks of peace or truce, and the war will not stop until India is completely destroyed or captured, even if it involves our own destruction.
This is Islamic history.
Before the resolution, the message that had to be given by the public and the army was given.
In compensation for the Mumbai attacks, the abnormal diplomatic and military benefits that India tried to gain, made it more a victimizing party, than a victim. That is why, in contrast to the harsh initial global reactions, the world has now reduced their force on Pakistan.
Both the satisfaction expressed by the United Nations and the praise of the leader of Interpol for Pakistani efforts, irregardless of India's objections, show the side effects of India's excessive diplomacy.
There are no two opinions about this being a very beastly action.
But the question is, when thousands of Taliban were attacking Pir Samiullah's town, where was the Pakistani Army, and what were they doing?
Should the army not held accountable for what they did there for one year?
How many Taliban die each day due to their firing of thousands of mortar and canon shells?
I appeal to the ICI that they stop their guardianship of the Taliban, for God's sake, and let us live peacefully in paradise like Swat,
And they stop this fixed operation.
The day is not far when a resolution will be passed in the United Nations against army intervention in Pakistan, the same way as it was passed against Jama'athud-Da'wah.
Riyaz Ahmad Farooqi
First of all, our radicalism and our protection of them, is sufficient alone to provide complete proof and permissibility for action against us. And the very day such a resolution is passed, there is all probability that, in the United Nations, no voice will be raised in our support.
Supposing the passing of such a resolution is delayed, some other strength will definitely leave our aid to ourself,, keeping the example of America in front of them.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
The bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah, and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are eternal even after death.
But here, an international game is being played. Here ferociousness  and animosity are created to do the ruling.
So there is a reason created that if we are not here then these vandals and animals will come take over the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so-called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
America sees the torture of these extremists, but instead of being sad on these faithless activities, they easily name them as tribal culture.
The reason for these faithless activities, sometimes given in the name of tribal culture and other times in the name of Islam, is not something done by a person with a heart.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so clever that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also men of God and so is our army.
It is very clear that there is something fishy.
Instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and punitive occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion, was seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
You have scared the world with the fire of hell.
you yourself have become the reason of fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Who burned the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on the refusal of the oath after the Prophet passed away and who took her husband by the rope around his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
Was the attack on Medina by the Army of Yazid, and the incident of Karbala the conspiracy of Jews and Pagans?
Without accepting the facts, neither motives can be removed nor can they be corrected.
BBC people, stop this dual policy.
A better super hit title is:  The beating of Bush with shoes, right or wrong?
This should have been the topic.
Tahir Chowdhry, Japan
Be ashamed, the body of a person was taken out of the grave and hung on a pole because he spoke against the cruelty and you are more concerned about the Box Office.
The success of operation Sherdil and across the border the success of operation Lion Heart depends on the direction of the sympathies of the common folk.
This step of American and Pakistani intelligence agencies and Pir Sahib is the victim of this conspiracy.
All the comments on this forum would be against the Taliban because intelligence agents have successfully infiltrated the Taliban ranks and they are carrying out actions that can change the perception of the people.
I only want to ask that while this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public? They even report something like this: 'While bombing Taliban residences, a stray shell kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000 in Swat went there to do.
The bodies of the Taliban who help the army are left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green-footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC, did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake, stop this drama.
These Talibans have tarnished the Muslim image.
If in the whole world true Muslims don't call these terrorists Muslims, then how come these elements are able to live in the lands of true Muslims?
Those who become shameless and won't do hard labor pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
No religion or family tradition allows this.
Including the BBC, all the media present their views on the Taliban or the tribal people in different ways.
No one is aware of the ground realities or what the truth is. It is us, the tribal people, who know what the problem is.
In short, its a game in which the CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a talib or a tribal. Who made these institutions? Warmongers--who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions.
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute the leader of MQM, Althaf Husain, and the leaderships of ANP and PPP, as they have spoken against this cancer, i.e. the Taliban.
This cancer was given birth to by Zia-ul-Haqq. He has gone, but he has destroyed Pakistan as he went.
But I have hope that the present government will eradicate this cancer.
After the Mumbai attacks, India  said that there were some Pakistani extremists behind the attack.
Pakistan refuted these claims and said that it would help India to investigate in every possible way.
India said that they have given Pakistan a list of the suspected extremists wanted by India.
Now Pakistan says that the Jaish-e-Mohammad leader, who is included in the list, Moulana Mas'ood Azhar, is not under house arrest, and that the government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Previously, the President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari had rejected the idea that western intelligence agencies and the Indian government had provided Pakistan proof about the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said, regarding Ajmal Kasab, that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
At that time, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that their relationship with India could not improve as long as their land continues to be used for terrorism.
And in the latest developments, the Indian cricket team canceled their tour of Pakistan.
Should these political events affect sports?
What do you see in the future of Indo-Pakistani relations?
Neither America nor India will break Pakistan.
Pakistan will break itself.
Faced with so much division, regionalism, and infiltration, what else can you expect?
Time has proved that Jinnah did no good for the Indian Muslims.
Yasmin, Chicago
Madam, if Jinnah's manner had improved, the sicknesses of regionalism, factionism and infiltration would not have spread in Pakistan, nor would the Indian Muslims have been treated in this way.
It is our fault that we couldnt reproduce a leader of similar stature.
If we can't respect our leaders, then who can we respect?
There are many able-bodied people in this part of the world.
God knows when some sense will return to the people and when the blessing of Consensus in opinion will help improve this area.
In both countries the Mullahs, Pundits, Taliban, Shiv Sena, the RSS, etc have been established to oppose the progression of peace.
Destructive forces don't want this area to develop and for that, these countries are manipulated like puppets.
Can you imagine, with the aid of Consensus between Pakistan, India, and China, what position they would have in the world?
It is God's punishment that has positioned thieves, robbers and manipulators as leaders of this country.
May God protect Pakistan from any harm, Amen.
But sir, open your eyes and look around and you will see the current situation and ground realities revealing the extent to which the American have progressed.
Moreover, the internal affairs don't seem to be good, as you can see the circumstances in NWFP, Balochistan and in Karachi in Sindh.
In this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
Oh Allah, bestow your mercy upon us.
Account to my understanding, a final war is inevitable.
This is enough of it.
Now it should be do or die.
This problem can not be solved through these acts of insincere dialogues.
and not through small scale terrorism in each other's country.
After all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
and if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all of our political parties agree on this: terrorists and denominational activities should be ended in this country.
But our army rulers don't seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, America and Europe thinks we are with them in this war against terrorism.  But, on the other hand, we also help secretly help the Taliban.
We have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way. Thank you.
There is no doubt that the majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are also members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined  the party named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.
Although these members only did subsidiary activities, after India's great insistence The United Nations has invalidated the group.  The government of Pakistan is also  continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it's better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
Terrorist groups in Pakistan, support professional criminals and the heads of those are Mullahs who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.
And now they are doing everything to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan of these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous persons or not?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose work is only to kill.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What kind of world is this where life is hard for one who takes the name of a major pillar of Islam, the religion of Allah.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims but when Muslims even try to take revenge, all our hypocritical leaders together with all the non-Muslim world persecute them, just like our great leader Hafiz Saeed is being treated today.
India is in impunity of the Bombay attacks.
Pakistan relations are bitter. The better relationship as a result of last few years between the two countries have been jolted greatly.
India has always held the military and non-military groups in Pakistan responsible.
And putting the relationship back on track is being conditioned by operations against these groups.
Indian security departments have held Lashkher-e-Tayyaba responsible for the Bombay attacks.
In this way many times Jamat Ul Dawa's name came up.
This was not the first time that terrorism caused intensely bad relations between two countries.
On December 2001, after attack on the Indian Parliament, these two neighbors came to the verge of war.
After this, sanctions were imposed against Luskaray Taiba and it was included on a list of terrorist organizations.
On Jamat-UL-Dawa, on which a security analyst said that this is new face of Lashkar-e-Taiba asking for sanctions.
What is your suggestion? Should this group be sanctioned or not?
Should Pakistan take action against terrorist group on its land?
Does put sanction on Jamat Ul Dawa present India
Pak crisis could resolve and for real peace in between two countries how important is that to finished groups who have weapons?
The United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions against Jamat Ul Dawa in its last session. What evidence does the Security Council have for its haste?
Public Tranquility Council will always never show this much of expertness against Muslims?
This we say as Accuser is Weak and witness is Strong!
If you see India has made itself as a Disappointed Country
To the embarrassment of the Intelligence, Military and other Security Departments, a few terrorists have made them to dance for 72 hours and now India in its mortification is blaming Pakistan for this and trying to trick the whole world.
If one non-Muslim is murdered then the voices will be raised from whole world. Why is there this double standard?
To my dearest country's one and only nonpolitical, religious, cultural organization -----------
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
Till the time Prophet PBUH, Saints and the Follower has given the respect to the Human beings, With Peace the Religion Islam was advertised a lot and was going on
Muslims have had success in every land.
When this beautiful religion came to ordinary people, then divisions arose between Muslims and non Muslims and a new era of tumults and quarrel began. Previously the world was not aware of this.
Do greet them sir, but at your own expense.
Don't do it under the pressure of America.
If India has any complaints, then it should come up with evidence.
Why don't they do so?
Why do they blame everything on us?
Extremist groups are also present in India, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the world?
What can India explain about its actions in Kashmir?
and what of the actions of Israel?
The truth is that we are the first nuclear Islamic state in the world and that is the cause of all the hatred.
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart.
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all of these sanctions seem to be part of this conspiracy.
Americans are now not slowly but very swiftly tightening their grip over Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances,if we as a nation do not display unity and solidarity and if Bangladesh can be created, then anything can happen.
Terrorism is condemned, whether it is in a hotel in Mumbai or in a Marriott Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine.
Ignoring the nationalities of the terrorists, they all should be eliminated no matter if they are Pakistanis, Indians, Americans or Israelites.
Now the question is that why the whole world, including Pakistani officials, are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack on the Marriott Hotel a terrorist act?
Then why?
Praise the worthy Advisor interior,Mister Rehman Malik,by the grace of God, how brave he has become!

Not only this, according to the BBC Minister Malik has also tried to negate this impression with full strength that all these imprisonments are being carried out on whose orders.
Praise the lord!
Having this capability or not, that I don't want to say.
Whose war are we Pakistanis fighting
We have our own priorities, which we shall protect with our full strength.
Nobody has the authority to interfere with any other country.
Apparently colonial period does not seem to exist.
If people are expecting justice, then they should empower law enforcement agencies, respect democratic institutions and refrain from aiding dictators or any military personnel. Then the Third World country Pakistan can attain peace, and that would be unacceptable for the extremist groups.
Pakistan is already in favor of the European Union and America.
This is despite the fact that the majority of groups in Pakistan are against this favor.
So this promotes more opposition.
If America and its allied forces should leave Pakistan and believe in democracy, then the people will start supporting the sovereignty by stopping their protest.
Pakistan is capable of deciding the issues by either dialogues or by arms.
Pakistani forces occupying Kashmir raided one of the camps of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba.
After the Mumbai attacks, there is pressure on Pakistan to increase the operation against extremist organizations.
India claims that the Lashkar-e-Tayyaba was involved in the  Mumbai attacks.

It is their claim that without a doubt, the extremists who carried out the Mumbai attacks used Pakistani land.
Meanwhile, officials in Peshawar claim that the lot of trucks which carry supplies to the united forces in Afghanistan was burned by unidentified armed people, because of which more than 50 trucks were destroyed.
This is the second attack in Peshawar on NATO and American supplies in the last 48 hours.
Meanwhile, Pakistan captured an established camp of the almost non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba. Previously, lots of efforts were carried out to try to disarm groups all the way from Karachi to the tribal regions, which included giving compensation to those who returned their weapons and even assuring them that no action would be taken against them.
The situation is telling us that the efforts undertaken in the regime of General Ziyaul Haqq, after the previous Soviet Union's interference in Afghanistan to get rid of the armed groups that formed as a result of the resistance that started through American and Saudi funding, and to bring an environment similar to that before 1980 were not successful.
The question is what does Pakistan want to do?
Does Pakistan have the ability to do so?
What do you say?

I have only one question for all humanitarian leaders.
It is impossible that you murder their children and they bring garlands to you.

Knowledge of East and West, is there any logic, reason or philosophy which allows killing of innocent people including Namazi, laborers and poor service men in the revenge of American attacks?
If your answer is no, then you need to correct your point of view.
People were armed because there was a danger of Russia attacking Pakistan after Afghanistan.
Now when the danger is that America can attack Pakistan from the channel of Afghanistan, which was mentioned directly in the presidential campaign by the president himself. Then why should he unarm these people?
It is because America and India will not have to face any public resistance after defeating the Pakistan army.
Yes, if any of them are involved in terrorist activities, then only Pakistan should take action against them.
But the sad fact of the matter is that leaders of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba declared India's accusations were correct, and that Pakistan was involved.
Najeeb Ur Rehman Psycho *Lahore*
Even if it is accepted that Lashkar-e-Tayyaba is involved, the blame cannot be placed on the Pakistani Government.
And another question arises, "did these terrorists not have the aid of some government or non-government employee of India"?
Are the terrorists born or made only in Pakistan, and not in India or other nations of the world?
As far as Lashkar-e-Tayyaba is concerned, it has no involvement in the recent incidents.
It should be kept in mind that Hafiz Saeed was the first Jihadi leader who claimed that the actions of the Taliban were a Fitna.
I believe without a doubt that all the actions of the Taliban were an integral part of the American scheme, therefore it is necessary to eradicate anyone and everyone who stands in the way of the Taliban.
Despite the co-operation of the entire nation, launching an operation under the pressure of India shows the stature and non-existant leadership qualities of Zerdari and company.
The operations started with American and Saudi funding, and has to come to an end. To do so, it should be requested of them to wipe out this filth that is consistently polluting our society.
And also protest against them asking them based on what ethics, America and Saudi spread dangerous weapons and so called Jihadi, but in reality hate inciting and cultural virus enticing literature in our country, because of which our country has become a human slaughterhouse.
After facing the risk of attack from India, the Pakistani Army's announcement that it would remove forces from the Afghan border and post them at the Indian border, and the announcement of the Taliban that it would handle the Afghan border, caused America to stumble, and pressurize India not to attack Pakistan.
This showed the strength of America in the region.
India did not warn that they would attack, and nor do they have the courage to do so.
The Taliban attacked and destroyed most of the remaining American supplies.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and the Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi is the trade and financial center of Pakistan, and the Dubai of the backward regions.
Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty-handed, but ever since law and order in the western border regions was lost, everybody diverted their attention here.
Now they want to kidnap this city.
For the first time, Pathans began to be called Pukhtons, and the people of a single town are made foreigners and are being made to fight, while the need is for unity.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speakers learn Pashto, or the Pashto speakers learn Urdu, or maybe it's better for everybody to learn English.
You must be thinking it's a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also amusing?
That the cause of the torture would be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, in my childhood I actually gave the same suggestion many times to my friends, which included people from all religious and political groups, but people used to laugh at those suggestions.
At that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not as apparently alive and powerful on the surface but they were boiling inside.
It is hard to understand what is happening and why.
Are these the signs of the Judgement Day?
what are these innocent people being killed for?
the reason is in front of everyone. Those who want to break Pakistan into pieces are active and those who do all this belong to neither a religion nor a country.
Be it Karachi or Mumbai, the houses were set on fire by its own residents.
Governments in power will typically change the names of airports, major roads and buildings, which is the case today  as infrastructure projects are renamed in memory of Baynazeer.
Does Baynzeer understand what is going on with the people of Karachi and Pakistan?
While the Mumbai attack was on peak, the initiative taken by RAW(Indian spy agency)to start sectarian violence was busted.  This event proves that in past, political figures on RAW's payroll have now given up the job.
Pakistani's from Karachi to Khyber have been awakened because of the spilling of innocent blood of Pushto-speaking people and persistent threats from India.
All strict applause of anger from political, religious, sectarian and national bodies, is now teaching India the manners of diplomatic speech. They have provided American strategists a chance to think again.
Those responsible for the turmoil in Karachi are Mutahida and Awami National Party, ANP , as the establishment is inclined towards one party and not neutral.
The establishment could have controlled the events in an hour, but it intentionally allowed the event to escalate.
Police and rangers abstained from taking any action since they were under pressure from political parties.
The talks about a unity among political parties on the issue is limited to paper only. Parties will have to forgo their own vested interests and work for the interests of a common man
These kinds of incidents will keep taking place until there is pressure on the administration.
To me, these people are the biggest terrorists.
Foreign powers are definitely involved in this, but no one knows who they are.
But alas, that if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there, but since its not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
The government should operate here, saving a large and very important city of the country from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
BBC Urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure, and Pakistani media's condition is already weak.
The whole truth is on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that either Urdu speakers should learn Pushto, or Pushto speaking learn Urdu, or better if every body learns English.
You will definitely take this as a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
Was language the reason for violence?
There was another story of cruelty recorded in Karachi, the terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
Wherever one could do something, he did everything. Reports in the media are 50% of what has happened here in four days.
Citizens Stayed awake in the last four nights and are still afraid.
Who evacuated hotels, killed cobblers peanut sellers.
Those who cause unrest on the highways and cut off the ears of the innocent are all not aware of the judgment of Allah, which they shall receive one day.
In your opinion, what are the reasons for this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
Placing in front of us the heart-rending attacks on Bombay, we certainly do not have to dive deep to find the reasons for this disturbance in Karachi. There is one simple and easy reason that this disturbance caused the of spilling of blood.
It is evident that if there is something wrong with the father, it is not unlikely that the son will also be out of control.
The blood of Liyaqath Ali Khan and many other brave hearts was also from there. I am writing this poem to get rid of Saiko's misunderstanding.
We will also repeat the traditions of the elders.
They gave their lives to build. we will give our lives to save.
Faizan Touseef Siddiqi
It is very sad that we are fighting each other at a time when the whole country is under attack.
I will tell Mr. Siddiqi to check Wikipedia.org.
Then he will know that he was from a repectable Punjabi family in the Karnal region of Punjab district.
Because of his efforts for immigrants, today the immigrants call him on of their own.
Every action has a reaction.
One can bear one's self, but...
Consequences of noises.
Many of us who live in large towns and cities have grown used to working in noise which comes from several different sources. There is the noise of moving trains, which is heard at almost all hours of the day,
The Jet planes that fly over head produce noise of even greater loudness and intensity.
Many people have no time to think of noises as one type or another.
They become part of our daily lives.
There is something to be thought of, does noise affect our lives in any harmful ways?
There is evidence that it does so in several ways.  It has been recognized for a long time to do such.
Exposure to high intensity noise can lead to loss of hearing.  There have been cases of boiler-makers, for example, who suffer from occupational deafness.
More recently it has also been found that people who are continuously exposed to other loud noises require protection of the ear.
If we live in industrial areas, which are growing with every passing year, there is the deafening noise produced by the speakers in houses or shops, radio sets in the neighborhood, and even school children at play or at chorus practice.
MQM is a coalation with the government. Muslim League(N) is a secret partnership with the government. The Muslim League(Q) is the party that passed the 17th amendment. Now, how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17th Amendment?
This is the way to get ones name entered in the list of martyrs by just getting painted.
The Peoples Party is not in a hurry to end the seventeenth ammendment.
How can anyone think of getting his own hands cut?
The Seventeenth Ammendment cannot be abolished until Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of the majority in one of our surveys and it is correct.
Zardari would not have opted to be the President if the seventeenth ammendment was to be abolished.
Now he is more powerful than President Musharraf, since along with President he is also  the chairman of Peoples Party.
The seventeenth ammendment will be there as long as he is the president.
Political Parties will have to remove President Zardari first in order to abolish  the seventeenth ammendment.
This is not the will of MQM nor of other parties.
Most people in our family are of the laborer type.
And in our childhood, when we saw our uncles toil, we wished in our hearts that Allah would save us from hard physical labor.
To save ourselves from this, we wrote a letter to the editor of the Amroz Daily, asking him what we could do after metric to save ourselves from having to toil.
The editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and study Science and Math subjects.
My focus was always on engineering; and, after metric, instead of Biology I took Technical Drawing.
But while entering the FSC, my older brother forced me to do my FSC in medicine and become a doctor.
I studied biology for a month with great difficulty, and when I still couldn't understand anything, I took math as a subject instead.
So fear of labor made me an engineer, and today I am in very good condition compared to many of my peers, for which I am always thanking Allah.
I remembered this when I was trying to lift the carpet with my two young sons at our old house.
It was not half an hour since we started working, and the younger son said, "Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job."
We said, "If that is true, then study a lot like us, and free yourself from bodily pain."
The son said, "I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work."
Anyway, the three of us finished that work in three hours and returned.
My purpose of saying this is that if a person has set a goal, whatever be the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving his goal.
But if you do not even know what you have to do, then Allah alone is your protector.
They say that you should not speak bad about the dead but what can I do? Even after one year of Benazir's death, I can only see faults in her.
For personal interests, Benazir handed over the list of Sikhs who were fighting for independence to India. At the same time, they were crushing the Sikhs independence movement and also allowing India to transfer its complete attention to Pakistan, having taken care of the Punjab movement.
The Russia wars in the regimes of Benazir and Nawaz Sherif have become a part of history, which pushed the country many years back.
Benazir continued to speak ill about Kashmir and the atomic program throughout her exile.
Benazir Bhutto struck a deal with Musharraf, going against her London Treaty with Nawaz Sharif.
In her era,Benazir allowed her husband to openly earn money, which is why he came to be known as Mr. Ten Percent.
In Benazir's era, her brother was killed, and his killer has still not been punished.
Despite being a woman, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
In a way similar to how Benazir did politics on her father's corpse, her widower husband is now doing politics on her corpse.
Benazir came to power twice. She brought the people guilty for the political killing of her father to justice, but she could not even file a case against them.
It has been 37 years since East Pakistan was separated from us, and look at the height of insensitivity on the part of the public and the rulers. No one ever mourned or expressed sorrow over their mistakes.
We should have been observing December 16 as a day of reflection and making plans to prevent the reoccurrence of such incidents.
We should have been sending greetings to the people of Bangladesh on this day and been trying to bring them closer to ourselves.
The ruler should have opened the Jamudur Rahman commission file and pondered over the causes of separation of West Pakistan, mentioned therein.
We send gifts to the people in Bangladesh who are sick or in trouble, to help them and motivate them to plan their safe return.
we have no feeling, our neighbors die and we do not even know about it
We don't care about our brothers and sisters because we are selfish.
There is a big crisis. But we got over it and returned to our normal routines.
As East and West Germany reunite, I wish East and West Pakistan would follow suit.
We can be one again, if we scarifies for each other and get over with our selfishness.
It seems this wish can't come true in the near future.
Today's news reported that the Governor of Illinois was arrested for corruption.
to remove him from the office of Governor, State Congress is preparing to start trial against him as soon as possible. One of our friend who has keen eye on the current affairs of Pakistan proudly said that this is democracy.
In the USA, every man is equal under the law.
And there is your country, whose President was made after he had the corruption charges dropped.
We felt our nerve of wit and said, "what if a governor was arrested in America?  In our Pakistan our Prime Minister was once arrested during the night and was hanged.
Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
Pakistan was awarded guard of honor and bid farewell from the president's house who had broke the law of the country. Tell me, has anything like this happened in America?
Chief Justice of Pakistan was laid off in such a way that even after the nations support, he has not yet been reinstated. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America.
In Pakistan, a fake degree holder was appointed as health minister. Tell me, has anything like this happened in America?
After listening to this, the poor American could not stop laughing and also accepted defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by Americans from all sides.
It seems from his smile
The America is with his government, but he is forgetting that last year the same people were with Parvez Musharaf.
This picture was passed on as if it showed a family.
Previously such a photo, one president with three American agents, has never been printed in newspapers before.
It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased and now more than one agent is needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.
It is also possible that this was done by keeping in mind the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.
If he was a smart ruler, at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo, and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting.
If the rules of democracy are applied to this photo, President Zardari is in the minority.
The majority rules the country according to democracy, yet who is in this majority according to the photo?
Paradisical Swat is also called the "Switzerland of Pakistan".
According to the government, tactics along with force, and discussions have been going on.
But the use of force is only causing the Taliban to increase their own use of force while gaining more of the public's favor.
The government should eliminate the cause of the problem rather than use brute force.
By finishing the causes, Fazlullah and the Taliban will be finished themselves.
The proposed Shariah bill of the ANP government will become a moderate solution to the problems in Swat.
But alongside the establishment of the Shariah, the government will also have to take care of the economic problems.
From General Musharraf's initial few steps, it looked as if the nation would be freed of useless politicians.  But the love for power changed all his plans.
Whatever expectations were, after joining the 'war of terror', he began to consider himself irremovable.
And whatever steps were expected were no more.
Just as Bush's rule began to close, he started to worry about the end of his own rule, and he struck a deal with the thieves in the dark.
Even then, General Musharraf could have commanded the army, but the present government did not even know what was happening.
Whether in Bajod or Swat, the army cannot control terror.  Instead they bomb the 'enemy', i.e. the public. Apart from loss of life and money, if they are making the 'enemy' psychologically ill, then we are the enemies, aren't we?
Terrorism struck the Swat area in the Frontier Province and are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area.
On tone side, the governments writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side the effect of Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everday in Swat.
On the third side, the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.
The result is that on the one hand the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other, the Taliban has established its' hold.
And the poor citizens of Swat are stuck in between.
When a citizen of Swat was asked, "what kind of people are theTaliban?" The answer was  "Very good people, because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country."
Then asked how is the army, the answer was that the army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.
Then it was asked, "who are the enemies of religion and the country" and the answer was, "the citizens."
I am astonished how the Pakistani Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
Still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
First the girls schools and now the boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfews are in place so that the Taliban can move around easily.
During curfew, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
The question arises as to how they got there despite the curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone convince the army to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the army can defeat any enemy.
You say, blood is spilled in the world because of religion. Tell me, if there was no religion, would all this killing not take place?
Are Punjabi, Pathan, White, Black, Mahsood and other tribes the result of religion?
No, sir, no way! Only religion teaches that there is no black and white, there is no Punjabi and no immigrant. If it were not for religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between the white and the black, and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribe-brotherhood hatred.
Actually only religion trains man's character and restricts him as he has not come here on his own will, but rather the Creator of all that exists sent him here, and he must live here according to His commands.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France for two years I also felt the same way.
I do not know why people only expect us to call.
A resolution about Iraq passed in a few hours to send a "peace" force to Darfur was not a problem at all.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where there is a matter of death, we are still holding meetings about that.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
Is it true that everyone is waiting for their end?
So that no other victim will even think about using a great damage causing weapon like a gun to fight for his rights?
Doesn't your heart ache a little; when a father is running holding his son's dead body?
If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
You are a shame to the name of humanity.
At least this was proven that this area was also Israel's country for thousands of years.
What should happen is that both the nations should live together happily with love, but since they are controlled by the west and Arab countries, peace cannot be formed without their consent.
Even Iran wants to fight its proxy war here now.
Even if operations in Israel are stopped for the time being, they will start again after some other incident.
The interest of BBC's country is subject to the bestowing of America and Israel. And this is why in the name of ""enlightenment"", they have come with a series of blogs based on ""darkness"" and a blind propaganda.
BBC is just doing formality and to gain sympathy is their only purpose and wish.
Mr. Moderator is requested so he may publish the commentary by this humble soul so that one can guess BBC still has some integrity left.
Thank you.
No one knows about the author and the origin of this story, but the fact remains, in every era Draculas have fed on innocent blood.
Every era has seen war as well as bloodshed.
Surprisingly, the twenty first century man, who considers himself very civilized, is silent over this murder, done publicly in the day light.
How can he not realize that whatever is happening is showing the ugliest face of humanity

Well wisher, Sajjad ul Hasnain, Hyderabad Dakan
At this time along with Dera Ghazi Khan, in whole country winter rains are going on.
Here is a poem for the season. Enjoy the rain with this poem.
Even these rains are from you
Which when fell brings spring.
When it stops there is no movement
sometimes it came just like that, without a reason.
Sometimes it spreads day and night.
Sometimes loudly, sometimes silently.
Even these rains are  from you
in some remembrance some night
on some suppressed ashes
Sometimes we blew out the flames.
Sometimes we burnt ourselves.
Sometimes every drop is painful.
And these rains are only because of you.
All these leaders are going to run away with their briefcases in hand.  What do they care about what will happen to the country?
Let the population sell toothpaste or clean the bells of the Mandir with the peels of lemons.
And then our media is also corrupt, like our leaders.
The purpose of it is to get money out of the government, and nothing else.
And as far as the population goes, they can remain stupid because talking about them would be an even bigger stupidity.
Yesterday, a strange incident took place.
All around police are running here and there but not asking about illegal parking.
Moreover, the NYPD was not in a mood to look at illegally parked cars.
It happened that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in the Hudson River.
Until now, it was just known that the "terrorists" were related to birds.
Yesterday New York's historic cold
temperature did not drop to this degree.
My jaw is beginning to hurt after a half hour of strolling outside.
Imagine what would have happened to those people who jumped from the plane into the river.
Happy news is that the people all stayed safe.
The sad news is that the ship of company sank in this financial crisis.
I reached New Jersey from the West siteand also saw that south bound is closed and still what have I done?
On the way back, I got caught in traffic.
Thank God in my one hour trip I was lucky to find one road to the 56th Street exit.
I couldn't see the traffic lines for that exit.
Maki, My Pakistan: Same to you in reply of Eid Mubarak.
Ammaar: Of course, with faith.
Shagufta: Same to you in reply of Eid Mubarak.
Sara: I killed two chickens and cooked them to the best of my knowledge.
I didn't know any other method.
At this farm, you have to prepare the meat by yourself, including removing the chicken's skin
Dot net could take time to become right.
What happened on the form?

Read the blog and defend Firefox.
Deafer: wish you, you too Eid Mubarak.
Dear sir, use Firefox.
Ice will disappear.
We considered the Taliban group of Swat nonreligious, and they were only against education of women.
to show this upsetness every day in any plays demolished School and College of woman's.
This thought was also wrong, as according to the news of CNN today, the holy day of Monday, the Taliban demolished a boy's school with dynamite.

Just a while before this, the wedding of a girl with a dog took place.
Look at that groom.
Humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
It is the era of computers and its involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life.
Many people have reservations over this increasing involvement of the computer in financial matters.
Where use of credit cards bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
so now only through your financial matters like through your credit card, you can be located.
and in future, when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent, its benefits will increase more and more.
Similarly, in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, the credit card information is stolen.
Similarly computers have become the source of friendship.
Social networking websites like Orket, Facebook and Myspace have the first accepting level.
But has it not occurred to you that as we obey these social networks as we are being away from the people in act.
So, this way you have seen your wanted people and their index in the matchmaking website.
Now can you spend your life with a person like you?
I cannot spend and for this the wife is also called half body.
That she fulfill my void.
I am probably not intelligent.
I considered true all the talking from any elder.
And so I had assurance that my father knew the answer to every question in the world.
I was laughed at because of it.
But only what is possible seems true.
It is very troubling that there is the need to tell lies.
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
That is why I try to lie as little as possible.
That, I do not falsely please others, that too in the name of Allah.
And I say Insha Allah (If God Wills) only when I am asking Allah to complete the work.
As for the intentions, only Allah knows best.
This is a despicable matter that rose due to distance from religion.
According to both our religion and Pakistani law, young children should stay with their mothers.
Their expenses are to be borne by the father, and the father can meet his children.
Then when they mature, they live with whom they want to live.
You are right that the actual problem is the relatives who misguide.
Feudalism has overshadowed our deeds.
Even here, thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in father's property so it is resisted, although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated.
Here these restriction regarding relations have created many evils in the society.
The concept of remarriage of a divorce or a widow is getting rare.
Due to these unnecessary beliefs and traditions, the family system is facing disarray.
Why is it in our society, if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarries, it is not appreciated?
A Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago,  had all his children married, but when he married a widow, his own children went against him.
In my opinion, this is due to religion, is it not?
Until we are alive we will never accept that any one else can take the place of our mother. Is this kind of thought, a thought?
In my view, Sirs children have to think that, if after Marrying all the children, he himself married a widow. So is there any thing wrong in that?
In this way, this widow got some support and that uncle will also get someone to take care of the house.
You can be sure that his children are busy in their own personal lives and are not devoting much time to him.
Reason for this is unknown.
If tomorrow their wifes refuses to serve that old man then what will he do?
This is a result of pressure from society.
When people will redicule on this situation and on their family then the children will feel ashamed on the second marriage of their father.
Actually they can defend the situation stating there father has done this according to the Islamic view.
This is one of the curses on our society like we are totally into Venery from the past 40-50 years.
It is acceptable for a wife that her husband does unlawful actions but even then she does not let him marry another woman.
If it's in her power, she will not let him do so even after she dies.
It destroys her afterlife along with her husband's. It also lets the spreading of immorality in the society.
Nothing happens with the singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.
About your question, instead of bringing his wife home, he goes to someone else's wife and the dependents make a fuss for the show and stay quiet and satisfied. ( yeah, later the relatives of the wife get angry)
In the Indian subcontinent, we accepted Islam centuries ago but we still thought of culture and tradition as being more valuable than Islam.
Considering man's 2nd marriage as ridiculous, divorce as denigration, divorced as untouchable, love marriage as dishonor and considering a man marrying an older women is dissimulation of the women is only the result of this way of thinking.
Over all, by copying the western world, we are declaring the religious veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam was easy, getting rid of this way of thinking is very hard.
Allah give us courage and daring.
Amen.
It was not really difficult to write Urdu before.
decades gone to writes that little.

Amir Taimoor wrote in his book "I am Tamioor" that he has discovered the secret in life that if any force commander in chief on the first raw so that force never loss.
But the circumstances are different there.
it was said lay folk die for our self we die so martyr.
if some one die form Lay folk so killed.
May Allah bless and have mercy on you.
When I was coming back to the shop after Isha prayer tonight one man who was sitting in his car raised his hand and asked me to come.
I thought maybe this man has forgotten his way or maybe he wants to ask me something. I stopped and saw his whole family was in the car.
He asked if I can understand Arabic very well or not. I said that there is no problem. You tell me what is the matter.
He started saying I have come from Riyadh but someone in Medina picked my pocket, if you could please help me? I said forget about it, because this has happened to me earlier. In return I gave this man 20 riyals to pay for gas and to go back to Riyadh. In stead he started doing the same thing after moving forward a little.
I got really angry and when I told him and threatened him of a cop, he vanished from there.
So now this is the condition of us Muslims. That even when we come to beg money we come with families riding in cars and manage daily to get at least 2 to 3000.
Although there is an saying of the Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the hand above is better than the hand below and the hand above is the giving hand the lower is the taking hand.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims ( Amen)

The wife of famous singer Adnan Sami, went to a police station in Bombay and accused him of torturing her.
The police station suggested for her to contact a court.
Adnan Sami's wife, Saba Guladari, submitted a plea against her husband stating that Adnan Sami tortures her continuously.
and treats her inhumanely.
Now this has exceeded her tolerance limit, therefore a case should be recorded against Adnan Sami.
Police suggested that instead of recording a report, that she should contact the court because this matter is not under police control.
In your opinion, is the accusation of Adnan Sami's wife on him correct?
What if this accusation is an attempt of tarnishing the name of Adnan Sami?
Let us know of your comments regarding this matter.
Adam Saanghar, stamp.
as far as blames concern so any man can do on other.
There's nothing more important than respect.
what so ever relation of present wife and Adnan Samih , Adnan Samih leave his respected life and went India to earn money, now this popularity made hurdle for him.
This is due to his own deed.
Washington.
A high level American official said that president Obama made a strong policy against the Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
This new policy of America about Afghanistan focuses more importance on war instead of development.
Officials say what Hamid Karzai considers as a hurdle in Afghanistan to get American Aid, because corruption in the government, intoxication business get increased and Taliban forces get regathered.
American officials said that those people from American government who put pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more in which vice president Joe Biden and representative of Brack Obama for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke included.
He claimed this policy arose after the end of the administration of President Bush, who used to video conference with Hamid Karzai every two weeks. Bush used to stress the American role in rebuilding Afghanistan and its civilian institutions.
Officials say that the Obama government would rather work with the State leaders than the central government.
The officials say that it will pressure Karzai to increase the war against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing fresh elections this year and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his group will support Karzai for presidency or not.
Are the statements by American officials precursors to a change in the American policy towards Afghanistan?
Is Hamid Karzai's rule coming to an end?
What is your opinion about this?
In a series of three one-day matches between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2 to 1.
Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka in the first match, but Sri Lanka was victorious in the last two matches.
In the third match, the national cricket team's performance was very poor. In response to Sri Lanka's 309 runs, it only managed to hit 75 runs in 23 overs before going all out and suffering a humiliating defeat.
The result of the series shows the inconsistency of our cricket team's performance.
Despite the home ground advantage and claims, the National team was defeated. Can you give the reasons for this defeat?
Which area of the team needs more attention of in order to improve?
Are you satisfied with team selection?
Which department is most to blame for the defeat: fielding, batting or bowling?
Kindly share your opinion.
Malik Babar Hussain, it is sad that such custom of ignorance still exist in this modern age. These feudal target the poor and innocent people, who will believe that they are Muslims?
If a tribal chief proved his innocence by walking on fire, why doesn't the government take action?
When will the judicial justice play its role?
The Sri Lankan team has arrived in Pakistan to play a one-day series.
Besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
Upon reaching the Karachi airport, the Sri Lankan team was very warmly welcomed.
Two days between Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be played in Karachi whereas the third day will be played in Lahore.
Both teams have there claims over bowling, batting and fielding.
If the Sri Lankans are proud of their spinners, the Pakistanis trust their fast bowlers.
Srilankan Captain Mahela Jayvardena has said that it is not a single player from Pakistan team but the whole team is dangerous.
Murli dharan and Mendis will be the trump cards whereas the Pakistan Captain says that it will be a tough competition.
Shoaib Malik has said that "We have played Murli dharan and we'll see Mendis as well. We have prepared a secret game plan and we shall implement that in the ground"
Will the Pak-Sri Lanka series be really as interesting and exciting as the claims are?
Who will dominate the series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the main of the series?
Let us know your recommendation.
Gulfam wants his favorable speech and you are also to consider that it is our wish that you should write some truth. Do not make an interpretation, as Mukhurjee did. It is ordered to be said right in the open and it is equal to Jihad when Mukhurjee tries to get in the news by changing his speech.

These are all the same people who have responsible Kashmirs fighting for their freedom for the last sixty years.
No one asks about that now that they have stuck with fundamentalism and fight for terrorism. They now start talking about a deal.
First they killed Muslims brutally, and now they are trying to resolve issues.
Pakistan has tried to understand their two-way policy.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating this situation to distract the world attention away from the Kashmir issue.
Pakistan has always shown the true face of India to the world.
Now the British government has realized that the Indian government is maligning Pakistan for terrorism so that it can occupy Kashmir.
They are unwilling to talk with Pakistan on this matter.
British foreign minister David Miliband said that resolving the Kashmir issue will end extremism. The Pakistan government will be able to handle the border issues.
It should be noted that American President Obama has already expressed similar views on the Kashmir issue.
The British foreign minister talked to media in Mumbai and has written an essay asserting that the idea of war on terror is wrong, namely, Bush's policy of killing others on the basis of the threat to oneself.
David Miliband has said that Pakistan should show leniency towards extremist groups.
Under pressure from major world powers to resolve the Kashmir issue, India is creating unrest in the region to distract world from this issue.
Terrorist attack in Mumbai is also a part of this strategy.
Does India want to the allegations of terrorism its escape goat to avoid peace talks?
Tell us your opinion.
Usman Aftab
In my opinion many of the powerful nations do not want to bring harm to Pakistan.
But they are thinking of plans to keep it on a leash because they know that Pakistan is a nuclear power.
They want to fuel a situation for a revolution.
Other nations are thinking that in cornering Pakistan they may face geo-political problems. They also want to aid Pakistan while accomplishing their own ulterior ends.

Indians have been known to be snakes in the grass.
In my opinion they get cramps every now and then causes them to utter baseless threats.
The Indian army chief should keep his mouth shut. Either way we are ready. We know to give you a solid answer.

With the help of American wealth Rasil Quium gave a speech  with which he blew out American's mind this is wrong,but now   the surprising thing is attack and watch truth will be proved.Who's right.
Israel attacked Hamas, but no one stopped them. The Indian just saw what Israel did and wanted to do some thing to stop what they are doing.
Prime Minister Syed Yousuf said that all the issues of the Americans will be carefully discussed in parliament and they will be completely resolved.
Remove the uniform and their public support.
All issues will be told in the parliament.
Dr.Qadir has become famous with the help of the Prime Minster.
Is there any hope in your sense against Maryeth is any public support.

American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference, advised newly elected President Barack Obama. he said  that he had made many mistakes in his presidency, and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
As President, I did whatever I felt was appropriate in accordance to the situation, American law, and Constitution by often allowing the American interest reign over my own acceptance.
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop it.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him And considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this was his last press conference, and he thanked the journalists and other friends who are present.
Do you believe that Obama will not repeat the same mistakes that Bush made?
Was it too late for Bush to admit to his mistakes?
Will Obama be able to follow Bush's advice?

The Indian President Manmohan Singh has again accused Pakistan of hyping the talk of war.
The thought that Pakistan uses terrorism as its state policy.

This is very hurtful incident that Israel is publicly massacring the Palestinians, same situation is here in Kashmir but Security Council do not even bother about it.
As many organizations who are in Palestine and Kashmir should continue their fight till freedom and by creating unity between themselves keep fighting every kind of aggression, one of these days their Martyr will bring result. By the will of Allah
Israeli air attacks still continues in Gaza, since now several Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
Important political leader of Hamas Nazarian have been martyred with wife and kids.
The meeting of Security Council ended without any decision.
The resolution presented by Libia and other Arab countries condemning Israel is facing American opposition in the meeting.
The civilian population of Palestine has been under attack by the Israeli Air force for many days.
The world showed strong reaction over Mumbai attacks but no one, including Great Britain and US is showing any reaction over the violence of Israel.
Why are the leading Muslim countries silent?

I think the problem lies in the illiteracy of our nation. People do not know how their money is spent. The government is solving its problems by introducing new taxes. The power and Gas crisis will remain unsolved.
Everybody knows the real faces of the elected representatives of the people.
The power crisis has become worse in Pakistan.
On the other hand, the price of gas has been increased by 18%. Due to unavailability of petrol, people are facing severe difficulties.
The business and industrial communities of Pakistan are violently protesting the power and gas crisis.
The producers have given the ultimatum to close the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is annoyed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
Production has become practically paralyzed.
The government institutions are blaming each other to express their positions.
Are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas a joke against the nation?
Shouldn't more attention should be given to solving the problems?
Are the wheels of national development not seeming jammed to the government?
What immediate steps can you suggest to gain control over this crisis?
Let us know of your opinions.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that the people who called for a democratic government are being given such a hard time.
The the lack of available electricity, gas and petrol has become torturous.
There is no control over government institutions.
The law and order situation is getting worse, day to day. May Allah have mercy on this country.
The New Year has started.
The previous year was a year of protests and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered for terrorism.
We will also remember the removal of President Musharraf from power, the end of President Bush's eight-year regime, Bush having shoes thrown at him, the establishment of a democratic government in Pakistan, sudden calamities, the earthquake of Balochistan, and the terrible global financial crisis.
Now that the new year has arrived, how do you think it will go?
According to you, what tone will the political and geographic scenario take, and what wise steps will Obama take in office?
Is there any hope of moving towards the eradication of terrorism?
Will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?
What direction will Indo-Pak relations take?
Is there a chance of surgical strikes, or a full-fledged war?
What are your expectations for the new year?
Please provide your feedback.
The first anniversary of the death of Benazir Bhutto is being celebrated. She was martyred on December 27, 2007 after a  congregation at the Liaqat Bagh in Rawalpindi.
Benazir is no longer among us. She was a statesman, politician and world famous personality and had a unique status in national politics.
One year has gone by but the mystery of her martyrdom has not yet been resolved.
Her efforts in bringing democracy in Pakistan and the formation of government have not gone in vain.
Today, Pakistan has a democratic government and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, is holding the chair of the president.
How do you see the role of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan politics?
Who is behind her death?
Recently she has been awarded by the Human Right Organization for her work in politics and democracy, what do you have to say on it?
President Bush, after completing his eight years tenure from the government, he reached the Presidential Camp Office Camp David to have the White house decorated according to the wish of President Barack Obama.
In the eight years tenure of President Bush, America has witnessed the historical attacks on the World trade Center and its destruction, the Pentagon attack and the wake of war against terrorists entered in to military invasion in Afghanistan and Iraq and dragging different countries into this war and using American resources on it became the memorable things.
Due to this war, America has faced a historically economic crisis.

The Indian Government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The India cricket team is scheduled to play three tests, five one-day and one twenty-twenty match on its Pakistan tour.
The Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, Mr. Ragiv Shukla, told Geo News that he has sought permission for the tour of Pakistan from the Indian government, but due to current tensions between the two countries the tour has been canceled.
Is the Indian Government's initiative not to allow the cricket team to visit Pakistan on political grounds justified? Can't sports be kept separate from politics?
Is the Indian Government's decision counterproductive for cricket?
If an English team visited India Despite security concerns then why can't the Indian team continue its tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion is this regard?
Salman from Karachi
Those people who feel proud of visiting India
and direct or produce their videos in India should open their eyes to India's response.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami in which he said that he is not a Pakistani national but a British subject.
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan at the first opportunity, because he did not get honor over there either.

After the Mumbai attacks, the mode of the Indians has changed.
Jagjit Singh reacted by expressing that he hates Pakistan and Pakistanis.
It should be known that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsle. How has he become helpless now? Adnan Sami should stay in India. There is no need for him to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Aalam,
I will only say this about Jagjeet Singh - that he too changes colors like a chameleon.
and speaks on the occasion. Pakistanis, open your eyes and see how much you are respected in India. Do not be dull minded.
After the Mumbai incident, their hate-filled speech has increased. Now they are spreading poison about famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said ""You dog this is a farewell kiss""
After that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards Bush. president Bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself.
The second shoe hit the American Flag.
Security personnels dragged the journalist away from there.
at this point, president Bush said that he didn't know why he had done so , Shoe was of number 10, I had no problem.
Do you think this reaction of the journalist was an expression of deprecation for President Bush from the Iraqi people?
What would you say on this incident?
The tension between Pakistan and India's relations after the terrorism in Mumbai got further intense when the fighter planes from the Indian Air force violated the Pakistani airspace in Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
as a result of retaliation from Pak Air force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
sources say that both Indian planes were loaded with ammunition.
This is the first incident of its kind in the current situation.
The Pakistan Air Force has affirmed that it is absolutely ready to defend the country .
Federal Minister of Information Sherry Rehman has stated the Indian leaders have acknowledged the violation of Pakistani airspace, however this happened by mistake.
Pakistan's military sources have declared thisa grave incident.
Do you think India really intends to launch an air raid on Pakistan?
Is India's claim true, that the violation of Pakistani airspace was a mistake, or is India trying to cover up an attempt to analyze the capability of the Pakistan Air Force?
Will this incident cause an increase in tension between the two countries?

It is true that it was determined, but we also remember how many non-criminals they murdered?  Upon it she has proud that Nasirullah Babur did a good deed today.
But she changed afterwards.
But it is also true that she ignored the candor of her political party and chose her son to be the representative of the People's Party. How is that democratic?
Juma Noor,Karachi,It proved this Quranic saying that unbelievers help unbelievers.
Until the metal of the axe has a grip attached to it, it cannot chop off the wings.
Our leaders have a idea of this, which they are using to make secret plans.
God help our leaders.
