Not dieting in order to avoid flu.

It has been proven from experiments that rats put on a diet with less calories had less ability to resist the Flu virus.

According to the scientists one should eat a lot during fever.

In many modern countries it is sometimes fashionable to think that, by free education for all-whether rich or poor, clever or stupid- one can solve all the problems of the society.
But we can already see that free education for all is not enough; we find in such countries a far larger number of people with university degrees than there are jobs for them to fill.
This plan of education was implemented on 1990.
Because of their degrees, they refuse to do what they think is low work and in fact work with the hands is thought to be dirty and shameful in such countries.
The work of a completely uneducated farmer is far more important than that of a professor: we can live without education, but we die if we have no food. If no one cleaned our streets and took the rubbish away from our houses, we would get terrible diseases in our towns.
In fact, when we say that all of us must be educated to fit us for life, it means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited.
Education is not an end but a means to an end. In other words we do not educate children only for the purpose of educating them.
When men become organized into very large groups then civilization develops.
It is possible to get freedom from hunger, thirst, cold, heat and many diseases, so that each person can live a happier life than he could.
It means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited to his brain and ability, and secondly, that we can realize that all jobs are necessary to society and that is very bad to be ashamed of ones work or to scorn someone else.

Approval of the $819 billion economic revival package.
No member of the Republican party voted in favor of President Obama's plan.
Members of the republican party said that the economic plan is very expensive and will not prove to be effective.
240 votes were drawn in favor of this package in the members assembly, whereas 160 were drawn against it.
This plan of economic revival will be presented next week in the Senate, where the ruling Democratic party has a very small majority.
There is some danger that great opposition from the republican party may not make it easy for Senate approval.
After the approval of the economic revival plan by the members assembly, Barrack Obama told the members that this important plan should not get caught in the middle of political disagreement.
The president said that this plan, which he was hopeful would be enacted into law by next month, will help to make a more hopeful atmosphere in the country which will in turn enhance trade in America.
With this plan, taxpayers and and businesses will be relieved of $275 billion in loans, $540 billion dollars will be put toward roads and bridges projects, 10,000 schools, unemployment benefits, and research for new technology.
BBC writer Richard Luster said that Barrack Obama intended to introduce a new political culture in Washington by pushing back political disagreements, but discussion of this Economic Package has once again made political pillars sore.
Republican party members in the assembly said the bill proposed by the government was a waste of tax money and will not help to create new jobs.
They insisted on their own party's bill, which features tax reductions.
They said that their package can create more jobs at less cost.
They said that instead of construction plans, tax reductions can create more jobs instantly.
Bitterness between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Rajab Tayyab Erdogan almost shouted at the Israeli President and said that many people's blood have been shed in Gaza. And that as he watched he had felt sad that people could actually applaud this military action on Israel's part.
Mr. Erdogan said pointedly "I think you are using such words to erase your guilt . . . But you killed people and I am remembering those children who were killed near the shore."
Shimon Peres said that Gaza's pain is not Israel's fault, It is the fault of Hammas, who has founded a dangerous dictatorship there.
A correspondent of the BBC from Davis says that nothing like this has been seen before in an international economic forum.
Although later Erdogan said that since he respects the Israeli president and also his age he did not shout at him. But what he was saying was miles away from truth.
Turkey is one of the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, but for the last few years there has been tension between them.
The attacks were not planned in Pakistan.
Speaking to Indian news channel, NDTV, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said that the report of the Pakistani investigations into the Mumbai blast will be prepared soon.
In the attacks that took place in Mumbai, last Novemeber, more than 170 persons were killed.
India claims that the responsibility for the attacks belongs to the extremist group, Lashkar-e-Taiba.
India also said that Pakistani 'state factors' were guilty in the Mumbai attacks.
After the Mumbai attacks, the relations between the two countries were affected.
The high commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan gave his first statement about the report of the Pakistani investigations, from which it becomes evident as to what is within the report.
Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that as far as investigation has gone, Pakistani land has not been used.
It must be some other place, not England either.
These were the two places, Pakistan and Britain, of which I was in doubt.
India and the global brotherhood has put considerable pressure on Pakistan to take action against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan says that they has arrested dozens of people who were clearly involved in the Mumbai attacks.
Wahid Shamsul Hasan said, "We are not trying to cover this up."
We believe in acting upon facts.
Our investigations will be accepted by the world.
We will try to satisfy India with the results of the investigation.
Defending the delay in the Pakistani investigations, he said that "to gather, understand and verify such matter takes time."
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that India took 45 days to hand over its dossier.
A black person was chosen as the Republican leader as well.

Proof of Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad in Jammu.
There is proof of the presence of terriosts in the Punch district of Jammu.
According to goverment sources the police and the Intelligence Department are start search operations there.
Meanwhile, a fight ensued in which four extremists, two tribunes, and one policeman died.
According to sources, the fight continued until and troops of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Jaish-e-Mohammad showed up. More army troops have been sent over there to fight them.
During that time, Chief Minister Umer Abdullah, appointed by conflate government, met with the governor and announced that he had been selected by his National Conference party.
National Conference's Allied Party Congress also informed the governor about their support for Umer Abdullah.
Umer Abdullah will take oath tomorrow as the new Chief Minister.
Keep in mind that in recent local elections, National Conference gained 28 seats and made it to the top. Those parties which supported separation were opposed to elections and boycotted them.
Congress, who got 17 seats, has agreed to make a combined government with the National Conference.
Today, on the arrival of Umer Abdullah in Sri Nagar, party members greeted him with a warm welcome.
On this occasion, Umer Abdullah said he will play his role in patching up the talks between Indian government and separation supporters. This will not be possible until Indian elections occur and the new government emerges.
The Role Played by the European Union for Peace in the Middle East.
Looking at it from the government's point of view, the efforts by the European Union to stop the war in the Middle East have been decisive.
According to the Brussels official position, the Shoarzan Berg Group or Sarkozy's efforts are symbolic to the seriousness of the matter.
European Commission's Spokesman Amadeu Altafa said, "Every effort is commendable that can help a unified message from the European Union to reach the warring sides."
In light of the government's statement, all seems to be fine.
But in reality, the European Union is presenting a view of conflict amongst themselves regarding the war in the Middle East, which is very sad.
The role of the Czech Republic's president is already very weak.
In addition, the internal turmoil has nullified the effects of peace efforts elsewhere.
On the other side, French president Sarkozy's role seems to indicate that he is still working as the president of the European Union.
This is despite the fact that France's 6 month presidential term has expired.
Sarkozy wishes to play the role of the leader, but he lacks the authority to do so.
French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner is facing a most amusing situation.
Kouchner is part of a delegation headed by the foreign minister of Czech republic Schwarzenberg.
The problem is both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements about war in the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. moreover Germany has sent its special ambassador to Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance, it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.
This is proof positive showing Israel and the nation's leaders do not care about any efforts to reconcile with the European Union.
This is a golden chance for the European Union to do something, since America (due to the policies of George W. Bush) has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial Crisis: Suicide of Billionaire German Industrialist.
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany, left a huge business group behind him.
Until recently, the average German citizen knew almost nothing about Merckle's business enterprises.
When Merckle negotiated with 30 different banks to secure financing for his industrial group, his business interests became the topic of national headlines and he foresaw this unwanted attention as potentially damaging to the future of his previously secretive business empire.
The Merkle group had to face the loss of a few hundred million euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 million to one billion euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle was under intense pressure.
Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had got to this position from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic power.
After the death of his father, Adolf Merkel took over his family business and developed it quickly, putting on new lines.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 billion and 6 billion euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion euros a year. After the superb success of Ratiopharm, the Merkel Group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel Group around the world is near 100,000, and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical company Ratiopharm, always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years."
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have approved 400 million euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.
Therefore, after Adolf Merkeley's demise, the Merkeley Group came to an end.
According to new statistics, the crime rate among the immigrants in Germany,
if compared with other countries, between 2004 and 2007
dropped from 22.9%
to 21.4%
In the view of Joachim Herrmann, the Minister for Home Affairs of Bavaria, it has been a positive change.
He said: "It is to be noted that the number of those seeking German citizenship has increased."
The statistics would have shown the fact that most of the criminals were German citizens.
Based on this, a foreigner was quoted as saying that when statistics of crime are taken in his homeland in 2010, the above mentioned factors will be taken for consideration by Herrmann.
Mentions have been made in his most of his letters about Humberg except Bavaria.
Christoph Ahlhaus, an internal affair's senator belonging to the CDU said, "When one does research in a scientific manner, then the results can not be predetermined. The results are based on the figures and numbers which are the outcome of the research."
Ahlhaus brought attention towards an analysis report of 2006 prepared by a regional (provincial) office of Crime Prevention, in which it was calculated the crimes happening from Bergdorf to Hamburg, what was percentage of foreigners involved.
From the results it was found out that the foreigners'
Crime percentage is less, compared to the overall crime rate of the whole province.
In contrast to this calculation, when in Berlin in 2006 , the teenage crime rates were analyzed, and it was found that the teenagers having a foreign background was 7.44%
was 7.44%
However, certain political parties of Germany for example SPD the environmentalist party, The Greens, and the Left party Linkspartei (Die Linke) , are against the idea of collecting information about whether certain German citizens are foreigners or not, while collecting facts about crimes and crime rates.

This is the first message to Germany from Al-Qaida.
Having a critical eye on terrorism related issues, the famous expert Mikhail Luders says regarding this message: ""the recent suicide attack on the German embassy in Kabul is a proof of the fact that we should take it seriously in any case.
For the past few years Al-Qaida has been issuing video messages on internet and there have been attacks as well after such messages.
The responsibility of the suicide bomb attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul has been accepted by the armed organization called the Taliban.
Most of the German magazines were associating these attacks with Al Qaeda.
They are targeting Germany.
The fundamentalist Muslims are seeing German Afghan policy as negative and discriminatory.
They are blaming Germany for keeping discriminatory policies not only in Afghanistan but in the Middle East as well.
And because of this they are considering Germany their target forever.
In the meantime, the German Government says that the German intelligence agencies already knew about this video before it came to light.
The German department for the elimination of crimes is busy analyzing this video.

Tea: Effective cure of breast Cancer?
New research indicates that drinking 3 cups of tea everyday
reduces the danger of breast cancer in women under 50 years of age by 1/3rd.
The research done at the Moffitt Cancer Center in the American State of Florida, showed that chances of getting breast cancer is reduced by 37% in those women under 50 years of age who drink at least three cups of tea everyday.

The research also indicates that it does not help older women, even if they drink three or more cups of tea daily.
Specialists think that this is because of the presence of such components in tea that are more effective against such types of cancer tumors, which usually targets women under 50 years of age.
Research was done on 5000 women who had treatment done for chest cancer at Moffitt Cancer Center, founded in Tampa, Florida.
Their ages are between 20 and 74 years.
Specialists compared their medical records and lifestyles to those women who are free from chest cancer.
Specialists also came to know that tea had its prominent effect on one kind of cancer, Lobes, and it was reduced by 66%.
One out of ten chest cancer cases is such.
This type of chest cancer is dangerous because it is deep inside and usually diagnosed when it has spread a lot.
Specialists say that having at least three cups of tea every day can readily reduce the chances of chest cancer in women of lesser age.
They say that incorporating tea as a regular drink in your daily routine helps create immunity against the cancer.
Almost 40,000 women are diagnosed with chest cancer in Britain.
War in Afghanistan is the greatest army challenge facing America- Gates.

Gates told the Senate Armed Services committee that fighting is not the only solution to the Afghanistan issue. But he added that in order to secure several areas, sufficient numbers of troops are not deployed, and the Taliban take advantage of that to continue their operations.
Why Reduce Exercise With Age?
New Research
Exercise at any age is good for your health.
It energizes your heart, reduces cholesterol levels, helps in keeping weight low, helps to prevent diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer's or dementia.
Unfortunately the ability to exercise decreases for many people as they age.
Experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active however age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise from not doing exercise.
Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.
Dr. Palecca teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.
She lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.
The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the mechanics of the heart.
In which the pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.
The experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood.
They learned that as people grew old, there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.
Dr. Palecca says that as age increases, the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear, and this affects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garwin Cain was also a part of this study.
He says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this. And this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart.
Sometimes blood pressure can be a cause of heart disease, as it can cause complications in the working of the heart.
If the doctor and patent work together they can achieve the benefits  of exercise despite the patients advanced age.
A more detailed report on these complications and treatments has been published in the American Medical Association's magazine.
"No chance of immediate war with Pakistan" says Indian Army Chief.
The chief of the Indian Army, General Deepak Kapoor, has stated that there is no chance of immediate war with Pakistan, but that they are always ready to protect its interests.
General Kapoor has made the accusation that the terrorist structure is not only the same in Pakistan but is also active. This is despite the international pressure on Pakistan due to the Mumbai attacks.
He said this in an interview in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day trip to the Kashmir valley to inspect the situation of the overall security situation in Kashmir, which is under New Delhi's management, and to check the preparations of the armed forces at the border.
He was asked what his reaction was to the media reports which state that Pakistan refuted the proof presented by India about the Mumbai attacks.
He stated that the matters of peace and war are decided by political leadership.
Talking about the presence of the skeleton of terrorism on the land of Pakistan, he said allegedly, that India will fight against such circumstances and those who are ready to destroy peace and weaken India.
He said that there are around 7 to 800 fighters present on the land of Indian Kashmir from which almost 50% are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that only with the betterment in the weather, the efforts of encroachment between Pakistan and Kashmir under its government can be increased.  Although India has increased security on the borders.
They have refused the possibility of reduction in the number of army soldiers in Indian Kashmir by stating that one can't compromise over the country's security.
May God answer the world's prayers and may Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan are effected by this change.
That what will be what Mr. Barrack Obama gives to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams.
The oath taking of Obama as the President of America, whose part of the name is also Hussain, is where historically important in all the ways, is also a great challenge for the history.
Not only for his own self but also for those who supported him with all their hearts.
This challenge will also be for the white majority as it's not easy for them to accept that a colored man is ruling over them.
Those here in South Asia, especially the Muslims, who have high hopes about him, should remember that he was elected the president of America. Obama should remember that the president of America is actually the president of the world.
A little while from then, a person whose real brothers were brought to America from their own countries, wearing the neckband of slavery,and whose blood and sweat watered the roots of the strongest country of the new era, today the a representative of that very same targeted lineage will be called the 44th President.
Many people have high expectations for this man.
It is necessary for those who admire him to not make unrealistic expectations for him.
If Obama is even slightly successful in reducing the hate that is spread through lineage and religion based lines, it will be a victory for his fans.
What effect will this change have on South Asia, and what considerable change can be expected in the American policy in this regard?
How will these changes affect Pakistani-American relations?
?
Sir, whether it be Obama or someone else, these types of policies with regards to the whole world are decided by the multi-billionaire, influential, Jewish lobbyists.
As for Pakistan, with regards to the recent Mumbai blasts, the injurious actions taken by India, Israel and America have been seen by the whole world.
Even after the creation of Pakistan the governance of Swat was in the hands of its King who had his own army and law.
With the help of an agreement they transferred the administration of Swat to the Pakistan government.
But it's disheartening to know that our government treated Swat like a step mother would treat another's child.
After the governance of the King ended, there were no more schools founded in Swat.
And neither was the area's development given any notice.
Currently the number of girls acquiring education is far less than in previous years.
The Taliban continue their attacks on educational institutions in the NWFP.
Swat has suffered the highest number of schools destroyed and the majority of them have been girls' schools.
The Taliban have also banned education for girls.
Thousands of students are being deprived of an education.
what do you think, by stopping girls' education, thatthe Taliban want to achieve?
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities so far?
what do you think the government should do?
The question should be that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get as a result?
because the people of Swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them, otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that even during the Curfew. How can people be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing?
When the writ of the government is not being let implemented, how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities?
Now the question arises that having an armed force, armed with modern weapons, modern technologies and intelligence systems, why the government can not control these few Taliban.
The only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head, that neither their arms can reach nor they are apprehended.
The result of the discussion is that the Taliban with their wrong steps are making it easier for the imperialists.
Fifteen years before the war was being continued in Afghanistan.
ISI used to control the Taliban when there was the opposition from the Northern Alliance, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then, suddenly, the situation changed and the Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of money from America, so the former friend became an enemy.
Now the situation has changed, but the war is still going on and those supporting them in Pakistan are still Russia, India and Iran.
Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.
For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play God with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings
The question is whether war, armed resistance and terrorism are the solutions to the problem?
If not, then what is the magic recipe that will bring about a solution to the problem?
It is true that war is only destructive; it never solves problems instead it increases it.
Palestine, Afghanistan, and Iraq should adopt these models in order to get Independence; just as Nelson Mandela used in South Africa.
To fight more for social, ethical, and subjective rather than armed.
Kashmiri's participation in election shows that they have accepted this point.
Israeli attacks are going on in Gaza for three weeks and the death toll has reached to 1000.
World diplomacy efforts has still not resulted in a cease fire.
According to one survey; attacks after the 27th of December has resulted in 90,000 Palestine leaving there homes and moving towards a safer place.
On the other hand, NGOs has accused Israel for not taking care of Palestine Kids and said that one whole Generation of Palestine Kids are in serious physiological and emotional trouble.
What do you have to say?
What is suppose to be done?
how is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

The Taliban should be given a chance.
Basit, Peshawar
Please wake up: If the Taliban starts doing the real Jihad, then who will kill the innocent people?
Who will burn down the girls' schools?
Who will kidnap for ransom, or if ransom not paid then accuse people of being American agents and hang them on the towers?
These Taliban have brought such damage to Islam that no other nation or religion has ever brought.
Pashtoon Rore
Kohat, Pakistan
If the whole Muslim world gives a joint threat to attack Israel, then you will see how upset America, its father, will be.
Immediately, not only talks on ceasefire, but ceasefire itself, will really happen as well.
What can be done? Where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from?
Someone should tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step since he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
The responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies with Arabs and the Muslim world, but its on the whole world to raise their voices against tyranny.
This unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
Just like in Pakistan and India, before the 30th of June or the end of the fiscal year the government institutions are looted. The American regime, just before its end, had given a green light to Israel to do whatever it wants.
On one hand, America says that efforts will be made for a ceasefire.
On the other hand, the United Nation is passing one resolution after another but both have done nothing practically. This means that united nation is also working  to crush the Muslims.
All the Islamic Countries should cancel their membership of United Nations and they should lay the foundation of there own international organization.
Many examples are in front of us, where only promises and resolutions of America and United Nations came forward but only the Muslims suffered.
What is the advantage of these actions when BBC does not have to print anything?
Now, where have the principles of generalism been buried, When the unrequited blood of the Muslims starts flowing, at that time the ghost of unbiased reporting starts riding over the BBC.
who otherwise portrays itself as flag bearer of righteousness.
Saying something from their side is a far away thing, they do not want even comments from the Muslims.

The difference between you and Jews is that they call themselves Jews and Martyr the Muslims, and people like you live among Muslims, by calling themselves Muslims.
[syja786]
Long time since, in the forums of BBC, a specific cult has been targeted, sometimes in suicide attacks, and sometimes in terrorism happening in India.
Extremism is the favorite word for those anti-Islamic comments.
But by viewing the above comment, you can easily diffrentiate who is the actual extremist, in which almost a Fatwa of blasphemy has been pronounced for writing against Iran.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal can't be fought with the help of sword.
After watching Israel's bombings on unarmed people, what would one's tear-filled heart do?
But the actual blame should go to that terrorism and violence, which we state as Jihad and ruin the beautiful name of Islam.
Since the majority of Palestinians have already accepted the existence of Israel, does it make sense for Hamas to fire rockets on Israel or do suicide attacks?
Behavior from both sides lacks humanity.
The character played by America, and United Nations again showed us their support for the cruelties of Israel.
May ALLAH grant us, the Muslims, a way to re-unite. Ameen.
The real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism. After all, they are doing the real work.
This large scale terrorism would not be possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who those controllers are.
so in this situation, in common terms it is called DADAGEERI which means do what ever you can.
That it even hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry.
There are medicines for injured, and coffins for the dead. They are being supplied by the Arab leaders.
Should the Israeli attacks take place?
This is the actual problem that the leaders of Muslim countries including Saudi crownprince are in a false sleep, neither they have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
They should take immediate measures against Israel.
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Salam to all brothers and sisters!
It would be inadvisable to ask Hammas to stop struggling in the name of peace.  There are thousands of widows and millions of orphans that this would affect.
If Israel and its followers are at the peak of cruelty then soon a revolution to stop all this is going to happen, because this is the law of nature. America and Israel's steps are bringing up suicide bombers.
They cannot understand who are blind in the trance of power.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Now hammas and israel should befriended to stop blood shed.
Muhammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France.
Very accurately said.
We can assume that if Hammas is 100% right by fighting against malice  then it gets a higher place in the eyes of God.  Even then, at least, they should realize if by good deeds the peace of someone's home is shattered, then that act is no longer a good deed.
those who claim to love God, His Prophet(P.B.U.H) and their religion.  To love humanity is part of their belief.
consequently after Muslim's confiscation of everybody on earth which is Allah's order.
Najibur Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
Rather than facing destruction, they are instead invited to come to Islam.
Yet, Jihad is ordered against those who conspire against the religion.
Though these people should face opposition as long as they conspire against Islam, it by no means suggests that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering.
Brothers, the killer of innocent children only faces destruction.
I ask my friends to reflect how despite the lack of acceptance anywhere for Israelis in the past, they have grown strong and autonomous today because of their unity.
There's no division of Shea's and Sunnis within the Jews, rather as one people they have been able to develop and grow strong in every aspect.
In contrast, what kind of condition are the 55 Islamic countries in?
Not only are these countries behind in every respect, but they remain helpless as their enemies kill them, so that all they can do is wait for death.
It is essential that all Muslim countries unite to strategically prepare against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
There is no better strategy than to recognize Israel, learn modern education and means of progress, and let the world live in peace and harmony.
The Muslims have plenty of land and means as well.
The need is for proper use.
The first and most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque and this was impossible without removing Yasin and Arafat from the way.
The world is witnessing how Palestinians have been scattering after the death of these two leaders.
The Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
In 1974, a Pakistani Prime Minister was so worldly trusted that for the first time in history he manged to gather all the Muslim leaders under one roof with one hundred percent attendance.
Today, on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task to get the whole nation to promise to keep unity.
Instead, the incomplete mission of forming a joint Islamic nation will be advanced while still removing the differences between the Muslims.
This is a Jinn, which has entered Palestine for half a century.
This is a Jinn with many mouths.
Often, this Jinn calls itself bad names from one of its other mouths to divert attention and reduce the pressure of the world from it.
This is another mouth of this Jinn which is eating people in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This Jinn fears Islam the most. It knows that whenever it is removed only the complete religion of Islam in its followers, in addition to Muslims, prove that Islam has brought many Abu Jahls to the path.
The bombings of Gaza by Israeli war planes and missile strikes has been ongoing since the December 27th.
More than three-hundred Israeli citizens have died so far in these attacks.
Now, after the air strikes, Israeli tanks have reached the Gaza border, completely prepared to launch a land attack.
The Security Council of the United Nations, through an agreed upon resolution passed in an emergency meeting, has demanded that Israeli and Palestinian authorities stop extremist activities immediately.
However, the Israeli authorities say they will continue operation in Gaza until they make sure the rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
In your opinion, is this claim by Israel true?  Is Israel  doing all this to defend its own sovereignty?
Is the world community doing enough in this situation?
Does this aggression have any relation to the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can any improvement be expected in the situation in the middle east after the newly elected American president Barak Obama takes office?

Palestine will forever remain a sacred place for Muslims and its protection is a must for us.

Israel and India have to vanish one day since these countries are destine to be broken.  God will surely torment these disbelievers. Sajid Sadiq, Lahore.

The B.B.C makes it a point to dig out and publish such accounts.
After all, they have to maintain the illusion of their neutrality.
By the way, B.B.C news is factual.  But the tone that the news is delivered is also an essential factor.
The tone establishes whish news is important and what is  insignificant.
Among other factors.
Zaheer Chughtai
Now even the electronic media as well as print media of Pakistan, specifically a few urdu newspapers and columnists, have not taken a back seat to anyone else in exhibiting this skill -- who, while covering the increasing extremism and terrorism in their writings hide facts about the grudge mafia.
It has been said that United Nations seems to support human rights and peace. Except that the muslims are being subjected to extreme levels of cruelty and brutality. And what we hear from United Nations is that Hamas should stop the attacks. How long will this hypocrisy carry on?
Why are there so many atrocities against Muslims? If people in America stop backing up the Jews, then Allah Almighty has said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So if Americans have courage, then stop backing them, and see then their fate in life.
So-called writers and murderers in the name of peace should understand that peace in the world can only be obtained through justice, not through genocide.
If any nation perished through genocide and results of choice can be obtained then after actions of Hitler, existence of Jews and their uprising was impossible.
As poet says.
Atrocity is atrocity, it vanishes when it rises.
Blood is blood, clots when drop.
Now, who will tell whom, what is terrorism?
Is this comes in terrorism, why? because own pain is only felt.
Other people are not humans or blood of Muslims is so cheap or color of these innocent's was not red?
And now why there is no message of condolence coming from anyone?
I saw the terror act of Mumbai attacks as my own house was set on fire. It is painful to see the sufferings of humanity.   If such sufferings cannot be seen by others; May the Muslims think collectively?
Dead bodies on the roads, helpless and wounded people stained with their own blood. How it should be condemned; words are too poor to express this condemnation.
My heart is crying over the miseries and helplessness of Muslims. On one hand People are being killed in India and on the other hand, without any solid proof, whole world is pressing Pakistan to do more or we will do it ourselves.
On the other side Israel is killing Muslims. The silence of the world is intolerable.
It may be delayed, but God will surely do the justice to end the dominance of falsehood.
A threat to Israel's security in the presence of US, no way! It is a joke.
In Israel, such tactics are used by ruling party to achieve public support. Historically no president was powerful enough to change American policies. Barrack Obama is no exception. Forces of Exploitation are similar in their character; whether they are black or white.
In this forum discussion, it is clear that every body is mourning the death of Benazir but she is not forgiven for her political mistakes.
It is debatable whether Benazir died for democracy or for the lust of Power.
If Democracy was her motto then why didnt she come before American clearance and deal? Why did she leave democracy under the control of Musharraf's dictatorship for 10 years?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the public needed her, but she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised.
When each and every historic figure is being accused, there is no one to say any thing over this.

how brutal is our nation that not only we are blind while writing odes on ourselves and our parties but now we are picking, accusing and criticizing every historical scholar and no body is there to say any thing about this.
Enough of development that we have made.
Sana Khan
few things are ignored just by thinking that nothing can be done of them. Just like a donkey can not become a scholar by just loading books over it.
Although after the Mumbai attacks, there has been a setback in the dialog between Pakistan and India, however Pakistan and India should continue these dialogs.
If we talk of war then it will bring loss of humans from both sides.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu but on the other hand when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader; point to be noted.
First of all Merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and to all the Christian brothers of the forum.
Greeting to all friends of the Forum: Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, sister Sana, sister Shahida and Mr. Akram.
We desire the flowers of peace rather than the flames of war.
War is itself a problem.
What solution will the war give?
Today it will give fire and blood.
Tomorrow it will give hunger and privation.
For this, wise people know that
it is better that war is deferred continuously.
In your and our garden
we prefer blossoms to blazes.
The relationships between India and America have become deep.  India knows that when the time comes America will openly deceive Pakistan.
It is America's older history.
The Americans will gain their target in the Indian attack and the Indians will expend all.
Pakistan should announce clearly that they will not attack first but that when India attacks there will be no peace or stopping of war until India is destroyed.
It is the Islamic history
Before this approval, the Pakistanis publicly announced what they wanted.
The Indian efforts of receiving the extraordinary ambassador and force benefits in fulfilling Mambai attacks are making it clever party mare than impress so after the first world hard opposite action decreased on Pakistan by the world.
The showing of United States  andthe showing betterment of president of Interpol peace of mind at Pakistani efforts by avoiding unnecessary noise of India is the side effect of the extra ambassador of India.
There are not two opinions about this dishonest action.
The question is where was the Pakistani force and what was it doing when thousands of talibans attacked the village of Pir Same-u-Llah.
Should the contentedness of force not be taken into account?.
Every day thousands of missiles and bombs have been thrown. Due to that, how many Taliban citizens have been killed?
I am requesting ISI to, for god's sake, leave the guardianship of Taliban and let us live with peace and happiness in our heaven.
Stop this fake operation.
For national unity the day is not too far away when in Pakistan the military affirmative will be passed just as it has been passed against Jamiat-Ul-Dawa.
Riyaz Ahmed Farooqui
First our intemperance lovers and their supporters are collecting the evidence continuously for legal actions. If any day any affirmative comes across then there will be a lot of possibilities that in the national unity there will be no one to raise a voice to support us.
If there is any delay for the affirmative to be passed then we can keep an example of America in front so that any one of the power can join us to walk with us.
We dont have the consciousness and knowledge of Sami-Ullah or his personality and his experience with the work he was busy in.
Probably he was not a revolutionary.
Kamri-Dach-Gaveera, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najeeb-zullah and thousands of other revolutionarys dead bodies have been disgraced by the hands of enemies.
They command even after they die.
But there is an international game being played over here. Here, they are ruling by scaring the public about beastliness and terror.
So that it would be permissible for them, saying that if we are not there, beasts and wild people will come and capture the government.
Such actions of the so called Islam-lovers, even in the name of religion, are extremely despicable.
The supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of America, but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions, give it the name of tribal traditions, and clearly avoid it.
No person with a heart can accept these beastly actions, which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of Islam.
I think the people of our army have joined these people.
This is because these people take some time to move around. To catch them will only take so much time. But even if they were there, they escape from there.
Are these people so brave that they take 50 or 70 people hostage and our army watches like an audience, with hand on hand.
They are servants of Allah and so is the army.
It is clear that something is sinister.
Malaiyat. Ziya-ul-Haqq's dictatorship, instead of presenting the noble and merciful characters of God, an atmosphere of religion-phobia was created by the use of many types of narrations of punishments and incidents apart from the incident of the body hanging. Even the literature and books asking "what will happen when we die?" created fear and terror.
And these people are only using this fear as a tool or a weapon to gain worldly pleasures and honor.
Preachers!
As you have preached against the fire of Hell that you have yourself become the face of fear.
As you have preached against the fire of Hell that you have yourself become the face of fear.
It is surprising when it is said that this cannot be the work of a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our own history, or we ignore it for some reason.
Upon the death of the Prophet, upon refusing to pledge alliegance, who burned the door of the daughter of the Messenger and pulled her husband out with a rope around his neck?
Had they come from somewhere outside?
Was it the work of Hindus and Jews the strike on Madeena and Great Karbala?
Without the submission of the truth nor the movement was away neither the check.
BBC people closed the quadrant policy.
The super hit title for this subject:'Was it legal or illegal, when Bush was hit with the shoes?'
It is supposed to be.
Tahir Choudry, Japan
Friend have some shame, taking out one Human being from the grave and hanging him to the pole just because he has raised vices against the wrongfulness, and you are concerned about the title of the box office.
The victory of Operation Sherdil was on the other side of the border. The victorious invasion of the Operation Lion Heart was dependent on the favor of opinion of the normal citizens.
These steps were taken by the American and Pakistani agencies. Peer Sahib was the target of this conspiracy.
Now, all criticism will be against the Taliban because so many undercover people had been included in the Taliban successfully. They are now taking steps where normal people can change their opinions.
I have only the question all the day that what will the force doing when the dead body was hanging the hole day,are they sitting in country to kill the normal people those say like this two children and thier mother dead by bombing on Taliban houses.
Do they not know about that chowk?
Or they were seeing an action film?
We say it with excuse, stop this game for Allah's sake.
At last there is a commander upon you also.
A question raised from BBS is it not reasonable but alas on the sow thinking of writers,.for example it was asked from any person that for what purpose the force went Swaaat containing 30000 persons.
That the dead bodies of the helpers of force fighting with Taliban remained hanged on poles all the day.
What did the Pakistani force with Swati public what did but the media contain BBC did the world unknowing about real matter and it was not good.
Pakistani force is making drama.
Every child of Swaat is saying that this is a blood drama.
Please stop this drama, for God sake.
The Taliban has destroyed the name of Muslims.
If the pure Muslims of the whole world tell's them they are Muslim, they wont get any place to leave form the terror.
Those are tend not to be interested in doing work, or living a peaceful life. Instead they take guns and join those people.
Islam has not came under the pressure of gun or sword.
Shame on you,
there is no reason for this in any religion or in any families.
The BBC along with other media's has gathered information about the Taliban.
The reality is not even known to any one, what the real situation is and we only know because we are tribal's.
Basically it's a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD, and our ISI are involved. There is not one agency in the game from taliban or tribal. The terror was created by the above agencies. Which are insulting Taliban, Islam, Madarsa's, Pestos, and Tribals.
Due to this action, Muslims bow their heads in shame.
I salute the MQM Leader, Altaf Hussain, and the ANP and PPP leaders who are against this cancer. It means speaking out against the Taliban.
this cancer creates by Ziaulhaq, he left but also destroy Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that the present leadership will end this cancer.
In India, after the Mumbai attacks, it was said that behind this attack were Pakistani extremists.
The Pakistani government denies such accusations, and said that they will give all possible aid to India in their interrogations.
The Indian officials said that the had given a list to Pakistan which shows the suspected names of extremist wanted by law.
Pakistan said that the listed names included Jaish Muhammad Leader Mulana Masood Azhar, who hid in exile and the government did not have any information on him.
Before that, Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari denied that Western secret agencies and the Indian government gave evidence to Pakistan about the Mumbai attack.
President Zardari said of Ajmal Qasaab that this was not proof that he is of Pakistani origin.
meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned Pakistan that its relation with India can not improve unless its land is being used for terrorism.

and in a latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to Pakistan.    And in a late development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled its tour in Pakistan.
should these political instances affect over the sports?    Should these political occurrences affect sports?
what do you see as the future of Pakistan and India relations.    What do you see as the future of Pakistan and India's relations?
Neither America will break Pakistan nor India.    America will break neither Pakistan nor India.
Pakistan will be broken by Pakistanis themselves.    This sounds good.
what do you expect after so much provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism.    What could one expect after so much provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism?
although Jinnah also did not do good to the Muslims of India and it has been proven with time.
Yasmin, Chicago.
Madam, if Mr. Jinnah's vision was followed, neither the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism had spread in Pakistan nor the Muslims in India had undergone such behavior.    Madam, if Mr. Jinnah's vision was followed, neither the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism would have spread throughout Pakistan, nor would the Muslims in India have displayed such behavior.
But, it's our fault that we could not bring up a leader like his stature.
if we can not care for our heroes, then
this region has great capabilities.
God knows when we'll understand and hopefully will progress the region with the blessing of unity.
In both countries, the destroyers of peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv Sena, RSS have been raised.
And the evil powers don't want this region to progress, therefore, these countries are controlled like puppets.
Can you imagine what status will this region of Pakistan, India, and China will have in the world.
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits, and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
May Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
But Sir, when open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
Other than the national matter are not looking good as well, circumstances in Sarhad, Balochistan, Karachi in Sindh are in front of you.
In this situation, a country needs a leader who can unite us as a single nation.
O Allah. Have mercy on us.
In my opinion, there is no way other than a last war.
Enough much has happened
Now this affair has to win or lose.
This problem will not be solved with hypocritical deceit.
And neither with small big terrorism in each other countries.
Even Europe, too, came to rest after fighting the last great war.
And if this great war had not happened, then they all would be chattering like Pakistan and India.
Almost all our political parties agree that terrorism and factionalism should be finished.
But our military leadership does not seem to be sincere in these regard. On the one hand, America and Europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism, and on the other hand we secretly help the Taiban.
We should think and fix our direction and choose only one way. Thanks.
There is no doubt that majority of the workers of Jama'athud Da'wah are the previous members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, who joined the group called Jama'athud Da'wah Pakistan, after Lashkar-e-Taiba was rendered inexistent.
However, after that, the members gave preference to social work, and now even Jama'athud Da'wah was rendered inexistent by the United Nations, due to the pressure applied by India and the crackdown being enforced by the Pakistani government.
I believe that, if Jihadi groups leave religious fundamentalism and take up social efforts, that would be better.
The present terrorist groups those bring in criminals in the name of Jihad, and the elders of these Mullas, are the same people who used to call 'Pakistan' as 'Palidistan', and who knows what else.
Now, they are not leaving any stone unturned in destroying Pakistan.
Actually, these are not even fit to be called human beings, let alone 'Muslims'.
Without cleaning Pakistan of these mischief mongers, the national security will remain at risk.
Can we still think about whether or not to put a ban on these mischief mongers?
There is no place on earth for extremist Mullahs whose only work is to cause killings.
This news tore at my heartstrings.
What kind of world is that in which it has become difficult for those who even take the name of one of the important parts of the religion of Allah, Islam.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims, but if a Muslim even tries to extract revenge, along with the whole non-Muslim world, even the hypocrite leaders join and treat those who have sincere religious feeling in the manner our great leaders are treating Hafiz Saeed.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-Pak relationships turned sour, for the first time suffering a severe setback.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-Pak relationships turned sour, for the first time suffering a severe setback.
India has always claimed that militant and non-militant groups which are active in Pakistan were responsible.
For the relationships to return to normal, taking action against these countries is being made a prerequisite.
Indian security agencies have accused Lashkar-e-Taiba of being directly responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
The name  Jama'athud Da'wah also comes up many times in this regards.
This is not the first time that relationships between the two countries have become serious due to some terrorist activity that took place in India.
In December 2001, after the attack on the parliament, the two neighbors were prepared to go to war.
After that, Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned and it was included in the list of terrorist groups.
Now, it is being demanded that Jama'athud Da'wah, which according to security reports is just a new form of Lashkar-e-Taiba, also be banned.
In your opinion, should this group be banned?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against the active fundamentalist groups within its boundaries?
Can putting a ban on Jama'athud Da'wah help the present Indo-
Pak crisis to subside, and how important is it for permanent peace between the two countries that armed groups be dismantled?
The Security Council of the United Nations has passed the ban on Jama'athud Da'wah. However, what proof did the Security Council have based on which it showed such urgency?
Does the Security Council always show urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful country.
Whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours? India. And they want to put the blame for it's inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis, continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salam, please do it with pleasure, but act at your own discretion.
Do not do it under American pressure.
If India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
Why does it accuse us of every thing?
As there are extremist groups and organizations in India, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the world?
What is India doing in Kashmir?
What is Israel doing?
The truth is that we are the first nuclear Muslim state, and this is the main issue.
Pakistan is now in last steps.
Kamran Hasan, Abu Dhabe
Your speech is from the heart  like the situation calls for.
Now the printed new map of Pakistan is shown in American newspapers and the round of punctuation is also a sign of it.
America's grip on Pakistan is becoming tighter everyday.
In this situation if we did not show union as a nation then there is possible another part as Bangla daish.
To show disatbleness of errorism is less where will be it in Mambae Hotal, Meriat hotal in Islamabad and in Falastin.
These terorrists should be punished whether they are from Pakistan, India, America or Israel.
Now the question that arises from these terorrist attacks on Pakistan that caused so many to lose their lives is 'why are you trying to silence the world?'
Was the attack on the Mariat hotel a terrorist attack?
Then why?
Hats off to Home Advisor, Mr. Rahman Malik. Masha Allah, he has become so brave and courageous.
?
Not only that, but according to the BBC, the aforementioned Mr. Malik has vehemently disproved this belief that the arrest of terrorists was being done at the 'request of others'.
Brother, Subhanallah!
That depends on whether the ability is there or not, or whether it should be said that it is not needed.
We, i.e. Pakistan, are fighting somebody else's war.
And why are there our own interest which we are trying so hard to save?
No one has the right to interfere in any other country's affairs.
This does not seem to be the era of new populations.
If people expect justice, demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan. I do not believe this is acceptable by those calling for unity.
As such, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
And this causes more feelings of opposition.
If they trust America and the United republics, then let them leave the style of new populations, and let them work on those lines, upholding the sovereignty of the state.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
In Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, security forces captured a proved camp of practically non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India's accusation is that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice told the Pakistani leadership that there should be immediate action taken against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack.
He said that the extremists whom attacked Mumbai used Pakistani earth.
Meanwhile, Pashawar commanders say that unknown soldiers fired and destroyed 50 miltary trucks.
It is the second attack on NATO and the United States.
Meanwhile, Pakistan made the show of disactive party Lashkar-e-Taiba and before this was tried to make miltary persons unmiltary and miltary wepons were changed with money and cartainly no any action without it.
The situations told that in the past period of President ZiaulHaq  the efforts of Pakistan to end of miltary parties in the result of enterance of Soviat Union in Afghanistan and the resistance by America funding did not succeed.
The question is whether Pakistan wants to do it.
Is Pakistan capable of this?
What do you say?

I ask only have one question for flag holders of humanity.
If you kill their children and they bring necklace for you, this is impossible.
Saeed, Multan.
And question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies, say any logic, argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men, laborers and poor workers of different occupations, in revenge of American attack?
If the answer is no then you should realize your need to correct your point of view.
The reason people were armed at that time was due to a  danger of Russia attacking Pakistan after Afghanistan.  Therefore, people were armed.
Now there is danger that America will overrun Pakistan through the passage of Afghanistan. The American president had as much said in his election campaign.  Why should we unarm these people?
It it become American or Indian armies don't have to face any civil resistance after defeating Pakistani army?
It makes sense that if anyone of them is involved in any destructive actions then Pakistan should act against them.
but this is morn, that government against Lashkaray Taiba  that prove right India that Pakistan involve in that.
Najeeb Ul Rehman Saico, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
If we accept that Laskaray Taiba is involved, it is still wrong to blame the Pakistani government.
And one question is also that this terrorist have a either get support of any Government or Indian government personal?
Is a terrorist only born and made in Pakistan and not made in India and rest of the countries?
as far as Laskaray Taiba has concerned they did not involve to this recent terror.
Remember that Hafiz Saeed was the first person who called Taliban acts as "Fitnah".
It is my firm belief that Taliban acts were a part of American projects so that every that person and group need to clean out from the way who challenge Taliban in any manner.
ven support by a whole nation, take action against Lashkar due to Indian pressure indicate Zardindco frustration and butter up nature.
America said to end this campagin which start from Saudi's funding ask them godly now clean this dirt as well, which make our society polluted.
One should also protest against them about their ethics, America and Saudi Arabia distributed dangerous weapons and named Jihadis but in the reality spread the virus of hateful literature and culture. Due to which slaughter houses were open in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly. And tried its best that India should attack Pakistan.
This shattered the confidence of America in the area.
Although India did not even threatened nor it has the guts to.
And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of Taliban or American posts.
Thus it was proven that without the support of Pakistan and its army, America can not do anything.
Karachi is Pakistan's business and economic center and Dubai of the less privileged areas.
Hundreds of thousands do not return empty handed from here. But since the law was enforced on the western borders, Karachi has taken all the attention.
Now they are looking to kidnap this city.
For the first time Pathan's are called Pashtoons. They are made to fight by making them strangers to each other. Although the need is to be united.
Urdu and Pashto could either each learn the other's language, or better still, both learn English.
You may think I'm crazy, but is the reasons behind this conflict not also crazy?
Is language the core reason for the violence?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir i gave this suggestion  in childhood in reality to my friends in which there were people according to classification from every religion and dialect but friends used to laugh on my talks.
At that time the condition of Jinn of hatred of dialectal and religious was not that alive and strong but it was brewing internally.
I don't understand what is happening or why.
Aren't these the signs signalling the End of Days?
Why are the innocent being killed when they have committed no crime?
Those who are active here, but have no religion or sense of country, have their own reasons for wanting to divide Pakistan in pieces.
Whether it is Karachi or Bombay, we have destroyed our own homes.
When the government comes, they just change names of the places to build a name for themselves. These days, airports, roads, and buildings are all named Benazir.
What has happened in Karachi, is this what Benazir means?
When the Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of the efforts of the RA to spread chaos in Karachi proves that political elements formerly working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
The unjustified killing of Pashto-speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awakened sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
Where reaction full of patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties have taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time they have also given American planners one more chance to think.
The MQM and the ANP are responsible for the turmoil in Karachi, and the government is only interested in itself.
Management can control the situation in 1 hour but it is being given wind on purpose.
The pressure from political parties upon the police and the military keeps them from doing their job.
Talks of unity are only limited to empty words and promises. Political parties should let go of their self-interests and work for the interest of the common man.
As long as there will be political pressure on the government, more such incidents will take place. May Allah save Pakistan.
I believe these people are the biggest terrorists.
There are definitely some foreign forces at work here, but I do not know whose?
And the sad thing is that if such a situation was prevalent in any border town, the government would take care of that place, but as this is far from the border, the government looks helpless.
The government should set up an operation here, and save a big and important town from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth due to fear, and as for the local media, it is even thinner.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that either the Urdu speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun speaking people learn Urdu; or even better, both learn English.
Definitely, you might think this is a funny proposal, but do you not think the reason for the clashes is funny?
that the cause of extremism be language?
They spilled blood in Karachi and the story that each citizen was fearing for a long time was finally written.
No one left any stone unturned and the reports that surfaced in the media was 50% of what actually happened here in four days.
I stayed up the last three nights and I am still afraid.
The people who killed the cobblers and peanut sellers who evacuated the hotel
The people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of Allah's punishment which can catch them anytime.
What do you think are the reasons for this sudden violence?
(BBC)
Keeping the heart rendering of Mumbai attacks in view and diving to search for a cause for the violence in Karachi is not at all needed, rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in 'blood'.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control.
Liaquat Ali khan as well as many Other freedom fighters belong to that society. He was writing a poem to remove Mr. Saiko's miss understanding.

We gave life for it and we have to protect it by giving our lives.

It's very sad that the whole country is on strike and we are still fighting each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, in Wikipedia
We got to know that Liaquat Ali Khan was related to the province of Punjab, in the area of Karnal and belongs to a Punjabi family.
For his effort to the refugee's, today refugee's consider him as there own.
For every action there is a reaction.
you can tolerate till your own but
I'jaz A'wan
Sir, before you get a large number of people with proposals, I shall tell you that the open signs of this mischief is also found on the walls of Karachi, in the form of posters and wall chalking.
We have been bearing both types of mischief.
Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan. They did not have to face any reaction.
Contrary to that, they are pecking at the chest of Pakistan.
There used to be one Muslim League (n), but they also made the rough version of the 18th amendment and handed it over to the Peoples Party.
Before that, MQM and Muslim League (q) had already handed in rough versions of the 18th amendment to the national assembly and senate.
It still seems that the copies of the 18th amendment is a political trickery, and no one is sincere about accepting that amendment.
This is why no fuss was made in the assembly or on the floor of senate over this amendment, and the parliament was not forced into accepting the amendment.
It looks as if the parties just wanted to get the thing off their backs by submitting the rough versions, so that tomorrow, they may say that we had submitted our versions of the amendment, but the government speaker did not take action.
If MQM coalition partner of government, Muslim League N an underhand ally of government and Muslim league Q the party to approve the seventeenth amendment, then how is it possible that these parties can be sincere to approve the disapprove amendment?
It's just like writing your name amongst shaheeds by just putting color on yourself.
Anyway, the People's Party is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment.
What would one think of getting his own hands cut?
As long as Zardari is the president, the seventeenth amendment is not going to be repealed.
In our survey, this is the opinion of the majority and therefore so is the truth.
If the seventeenth amendment were to be repealed, then Zardari would never had become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than president Musharaf, as long as, besides being the president, he is also the chairman of the People's party.
As long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.
In order to cancel the seventeenth amendment, the political parties will first have to dismiss President Zardari from the presidency.
Neither MQM nor the other parties want this .
Most of the elders in our family worked as laborers.
In our childhood, we used to see our uncles doing hard labor. We used to pray to Allah; please save us from this work.
We wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz asking what should we do after graduation to avoid a future of manual labor.
The editor replied that we should select certain fields including medicine and engineering.
Right from beginning, my concentration was in engineering, selecting technical drawing instead of Biology.
But at the time of admission in F.Sc., my older brother encouraged me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.
I studied Biology for nearly a month with little success.  I then took math as an alternate subject.
The fear of manual labor lead me to become an engineer, and now I am in a better position than the rest of my family.  I am always thankful for this.
I remembered that when my two sons and I were trying to remove the carpets from our old house.
It was only half an hour since he started working, the little boy said "" Daddy, I am not born to do this""
I said that if this is true then study a lot like us and get rid of the physical labor.
The son said, ""I am studying and I will get through it but  also  is the work that I can not do""
Whatsoever we did the work in three hours,and came back home.
The point of saying is that if a person picks his destiny, whatever is the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving that destiny.
Here if you do not know what you have to do then God help you!
It is said that do not say bad about the dead. But what shall we do, we see only bad things in Benazir even on her first death anniversary.
Benazir, for her selfish purpose, crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs after giving the list of their names who were fighting for freedom on one hand and on the other gave India the chance to keep its full attention on Kashmir after them helping to suppress Punjab Movement.
Tug of war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history, which has pushed the country back many years.
Benazir continued to give negative comments on Kashmir and the nuclear program after being exiled.
Baenazir went against the pact made with Nawaz Shareef in London by making a deal with General Musharaf.
During the time of Baenazir's leadership, she gave an open-hand policy to her family members to earn money. Due to this, she became known as Ms. 10 Percent.
In the time of Baenazir, her brother was murdered, and his killers are still at large.
Although Baebnazir was a woman, she did not fight for the rights of women.
The way in which Baenazir did politics, on her father's dead body, is the same way her followers are doing politics, on the dead bodies of her family.
Baenazir got to be a leader twice and in that time punishing her fathers murders at one side she didn't even file charges against them.
It has been 37 years since the separation of Eastern Pakistan. Sadly no leader condemns this day, nor do they call it a black day.
It should have been that we would celebrate this 16th of September as a black day and take steps to prevent such a sad incident in the future.
On this day we should have sent the Bangali's letters of consolation and tried to bring them closer to us.
Now we look at the reasons why Eastern Pakistan was separated.
He would plan on bringing back the people of Bihar who were stuck in Bangladesh, and would send them gifts to keep their spirits up.
We have become so insensitive that if someone dies in our neighborhood, we're not even aware of it.
We don't care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
A huge calamity can pass by, but the next day we are lost in our day-to-day routine of life.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again, like East and West Germany.
We can become one again if we sacrifice a little for each other and leave our selfishness behind us.
Unfortunately, this wish does not look like it will be fulfilled in the near future.
When it was announced today that the Governor of Illinois was caught on corruption charges
and that he would soon be up for removal by the state congress, an American friend of mine told us, "Look, this is called democracy."
In America, no one is beyond the law.
In Pakistan there is a president who was elected after his alleged corruption charges were dropped.
my sense of humor woke and I said that what's wrong if a governor got arrested in America, in Pakistan, once we arrested the Prime Minister overnight and hanged him and the second time we exiled one.
When did that happen in America?
Pakistan awarded the person who broke the law with a guard of honor from the presidency. When did this happen in America?
In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was suspended, and while he has the public's support he has not been restored to his position. When has this ever happened in America?
In Pakistan the Minister for Health held a fake degree. Has this ever happened in America?
After hearing everything the American went down laughing and then conceded defeat.
In this picture President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded by Americans on all sides.
it looks from his smile
President Zardari is thinking that America supports his government, but he forgets that a year ago they were with Pervez Musharaf.
The picture looks like a picture of family.
Before that one no picture had been published in which the President is seen with 3 high ranking Americans.
It looks like American activities have increased in Pakistan and one or more authorities are working with them. They might not believe the second person as opposed to the first one.
It might be possible that they have planned this also. Keep in mind the nature of the promise President Zardari fulfilled.
If any politician in the picture was thinking of how people would view this, they would not be smiling. Instead his face should show some embarrassment.
If democratic principles are applied to this picture then you will notice President Zardari is in the minority.
According to democratic principles, majority rules and who that majority is can be seen in this picture.
Heaven like Swat of Pakistan is also known as Switzerland.
Even now, according to government policy, cross talks continue along side the use of force.
But the use of force is resulting in increased support and sympathy for the Taliban among people not receiving any benefit from it.
The government, instead of using the power, needs to eliminate the causes of the issue.
By eliminating the causes Fazlullah and Taliban will automatically die out.
The Sharia bill proposed by ANP will solve the problems in Swat to a great extent.
Beyond implementation of the Sharia, the government will need to give more attention to the economic issues.
From General Musharaf's early steps it looked like the nation had gotten rid of incompetent politicians, but lust for power changed all his plans.
His hopes were raised by the participation in the "war on terror", and he had started considering himself as immortal.
The next logical and expected steps never happened.
As Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule as well, and in that bewilderment he made a deal with the thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army but never know what was happening to the present government.
In Bajor or Swat the army does not control terror but bombs the "Enemy" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy out to be mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy?
Despite the military operation in Swat, a war-torn area of NWFP, things are getting worse.
On one hand, the writ of GOVT is limited to a resolution of condemnation passed by National assembly. While on other hand, the influence of Taliban's FM channel is increasing in swat.
The common citizen has no choice but to obey the rule of power.
In swat security forces have used lethal weapons and have claimed to kill many extremists. But despite these causalities, Taliban's Power is rising. They are controlling nearly 80% area of Swat.
Result: GOVT is not accepting it's failure and Talibans are getting stronger.
The poor citizen is the only looser.
""how are the Talibans?"" asked by someone in Swat. It is answered as ""They are very good; they are fighting the war against the enemies of God.""
Then asked about the army. They replied ""very good, it is fighting against the enemies of our country.""
Who are the enemies of religion and country? ""The poor citizens"", it was answered.
I am greatly astonished, how the Army of Pakistan will fight against the Indian Army. It has failed to control a small group of Talibans.
They are unable to track the illegal FM radio channel of Taliban. I think it can easily be tracked.
This FM radio channel is strongly propagating the agenda of hatred and terror.
After demolishing the girls' school, they are demolishing  the schools for boys.
A curfew is imposed to facilitate the Taliban's movement.
Tonight during curfew, they made new bunkers in the nearby area of Mangora.
How did they reach Mangora during curfew?
If the Army can kill Akbar Bugti in a cave, why can't the Taliban be targeted?
The Army should take actions to free the helpless people of Swat from the brutal occupation of the Taliban. This will improve the image of the Pakistan Army.
He has said that religion is the reason of bloodshed; would it be a peaceful world without any concept of religion?
If religion divides us on ethnic, linguistic and regional basis?
No! No way! Sir, religion is what teaches that no one is black or white, punjabi or muhajir. Otherwise, if religion was not present then half world would have vanished for the war between white and black and other half fighting over the status and sect.
Actually, religion gives moral teachings to the man. And binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here. And he should spend his life according to his rules.
As a Muslim, I have total faith that Islam is a complete way of life and a true religion.
After living in London, for many years I used to ask wellness of my family over the telephone every morning, although many did not even call once to find out how we were. It was then I realized that they do not even tolerate our phone calls so we stopped calling.
Living here in France for the last two years, I have also felt the same thing.
I do not know why people expect us to call.
A resolution passed about Iraq in a few hours, Darfar has absolutely no problem in sending peace army.
Bombay attacks were condemned in no time and banning dubious groups is only a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are doing consensus.
O caretakers of international peace, life is finishing here!
Are people really waiting for it to finish?
Do you think that some oppressed person would not even be able to think about using a mass destruction weapon with ill will to obtain their rights?
When a father is running around holding the corpse of his son, even then a small wave of sorrow does not arise from any part of your heart.
If not, you have no right to be called a human.
Rather you are a black spot on the name of humanity.
OK, it was proved that this area was also the home of the Israelis for thousands of years.
Ideally, these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection, but since their strings are in the hands of the western and Arab countries, therefore peace is not possible without their will.
Instead, now even Iran wants to fight a proxy war from here.
Even if Israeli action has stopped for a while, it will start again after some incident.
The interest of the owner of the BBC is associated with serving America and Israel, and this is why in the name of 'enlightenment' it has come out with a series of Zionist favoring blogs and is doing a biased and blind propaganda.
What BBC is doing is  just a formality. Primary objective is to earn sympathies.
I request of the moderator that the commentary of applicant should be published to show that BBC still have some respect for facts.
Thanks
I don't know how this story was imitated, but one is sure that Dracula of every age is thirsty of human blood.
There were wars and bloodshed in every era of history.
It is strange that man of 21st century, which claim more civilized, does not show any concern over open bloodshed.
How does he not feel that what is happening around is a distorted/worst face of humanity.
The most tragic aspect: how the current face of civilized man will present the concept of humanity to next generations.

At the moment, in Dera Ghazi khan and in other parts of the country, it is raining.
here is a poem about the weather. Enjoy the weather along with this poem.
These rains are with your presence.
If it rains, its spring
If it stays then its peace
Sometimes comes without a reason
At times spread over day and night
Sometimes very noisy and sometimes very quiet
These rains are with your presence.
In a memory, at a night
To a buried ash
Sometimes the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burnt itself.
Sometimes each drop seems sorrowful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. Why would they care if the country lasts or not?
Whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them. (Probably an idiomatic expression; not sure how to translate)
For one, our media, like our leaders, is also corrupted.
Its goal is only to extract money from the government.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance. (First sentence fine, second is unclear)
Yesterday afternoon something surprising happened.
All the police are running around here and still they do not check for illegal parking.
Moreover the NYPD  was also not in the mood to deal with the illegally parked vehicles
What happened is that a plane of the U.S. Air Force actually became a ship and landed in the Hudson River.
Till today only this much is known, that the ""terrorist"" belonged to the family of birds called goose.
Yesterday, perhaps it was a historically cold day in New york.
The temperature never goes down this much.
Pain started in my jaw, after walking outside for half an hour.
I cant imagine the condition of the people who jumped from the plane into the the river.
All of the people were happy to be safe.
But there was still concern because the companies plane was drowned during the financial crisis.
After seeing all those sites, i reached New Jersey to find the only exit closed. What choice did i have left?
Coming back I got stuck in the busy street.
Thank the Lord! After an hour of hassle, a route was open for me. I found myself at the exit of street 56.
I had not come across the exit first, nor the long lines.
Mekki: My Pakistan..! Greetings. Eid Mubarak to you.

We unnecessarily kept thinking of these Taliban of S.W.A.T. as indelicate and were only unhappy over female education.
They kept expressing their grief by demolishing an all-women school and college somewhere every day.
Just like other ideas, this idea did not also come true.  According to this report by CNN, today on the sacred day of Monday this Taliban gang of S.W.A.T. have blasted an all-boys school.
In Swat, the Taliban destroyed the school.
The girls' schools were pulled down first in the cause of famous English school Ladies First and I do not understand why people consider Taliban free of crimes.
It is also known that it is wrong that Taliban are only against the education of girls.
The are totally against education of any kind.
These freedom fighters are gifted, more powerful than the Devil.
which is commanding us and he is helped to abolish it.
Amin after it Amin.
Wonderful, 120 schools have been pulled down so far.
The Muslim tradition of engagement before birth, to marriage with Quran in order to control inheritance and the insistence of many mufties that the girl became adult and sensible at 8 years old. In India, a girl was married to a frog.
See the pictures at the time of marriage.
Sometime before this incident, a girl had been married to a dog.
Let's see that groom.
Humanity has ceased to exist in the 21st century.
This is the time of computers, and their role in our lives is ever increasing.
A lot of people have reservations on so much dependence on computers in our lives, especially in case of financial or monetary matters.
Where there are certain comforts by the use of credit cards, on the other hand, law enforcement agencies are also getting to know more about you.
Now, with just a look at the credit card transaction record, your whereabouts can be traced.
If, in the future, limits are placed on the use of paper money, the benefits of plastic cards will become even greater compared to today.
This is why modern criminals prefer to steal credit card information rather than rob banks.
Similarly, the computer has provided a means for friendship or networking.
Social Networking sites like Orkut, Facebook and Myspace comes in first tear when compared according to popularity.
But don't you feel sad that the more we are accustoming ourselves to social networks we are physically getting away from people.
Like Match making websites that match your choices to other peoples choices to find similarities and you get a list of such matches.
Now can you spend your life with a person exactly like you?
I can't, that's why we can compromise of a life partner who is half or partly similar to you.
So the lacking of mind can be compensated by the partner.
I guess I got a lesser part of intelligence.
Since childhood when ever my father said anything to me that was the truth for me.
This is how I got to believe that dad has the answer to every question in the world.
People used to make a lot of jokes about me because of this.
The only thing that looks like truth is that which can be done for real.
It's frustrating. What is the necessity to speak lies?
Due to this reason, he suffered in this age as well.
It is always my wish to speak lies as little as I can.
Don't say lies, especially in the name of God.
Say "inshallah" only when the prayer is for God to accomplish it.
God knows all about your will.
This is the only complicated problem due to the distance from the religion.
According to our religion and the law, a Pakistani minor should stay with their mother.
These expenses are for the father and the father can meet them.
When the children grow up they can live with anyone they choose.
You're right, family can cause misunderstandings.
We act like this because of feudal thinking.
Even today we think the child will simply follow in their parent's footsteps, but the opposite is true. Although there's advantages to following in the father's footsteps.
But being locked into living according to the parents rules has created an evil in our society.
The very concept defining an individual by his status as "married" or "divorced" or "widow" is comming to an end.
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason for the breakup of families.
In our society, if the wife of a 50-55 year old man or the husband dies and he remarries, why is he looked down upon?
My own Pakistani uncle lost his wife 10 or 12 years ago.  Now that his children are grown and married, he married another widow.  And because of this, his own children have turned against him!
In my point of view, it is their religious right.  What do you say?
""To take place of our mother in the being of our mother"" what kind of thinking?
According to my thinking, his sons should think about what he did wrong when he married a widow after the marriage of their children?
From this the widow got a helper, and he got a person to manage his home.
Because his sons and daughters ae engaged in their own life, they will not care about him.
The reason is, the lack of knowledge.
If their wives deny to serve him tomorrow, then what will he do?
It is the result of the stress of society.
When the people laughed at the family,  the sons denied the second marriage.
We should remember that their father's doing was according to Islam.
It is a curse that our society has endured for 40 to 50 years.
A wife feels that her husband can do lots of bad things but does not have to remarry.
If she has the power, she will try even after her death.
Neither she nor her husband will go to Heaven, but she alone will go to Hell.
Saying the word "Islam" does nothing; its rituals are significant.
like discouraging girls' education, love, marriage, etc. (Note: not a complete sentence)
Now your question is, if the big brother went to the widow's home instead of bringing the widow to his home, would this avoid quarrels from his children?
We embraced Islam even before the separation of Hindustan and Pakistan, but we have still not abandoned evil beliefs such as ritual being more important than Islam.
The second marriage of a man is bad. Divorce is known to be bad. The divorced women is a untouchability sin, love marriage is the bad impression. The marriage of a man with a older woman is said to be the evil plan of the woman. The above things are examples of evil thinkings.
and we think that if we won't follow modernism, we will be considered to think like an old man.
Embracing Islam is easy but to abandon evil thinking is almost impossible.
Allah, bless us with the ability and courage to do this task.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never that difficult.
It took centuries to write this little.

Ameer Taimur writes in his book, "I am Taimur,"  "I found the secret in my time alive that if the commander of any army is present on the front lines, then that army will never be defeated."
But here the things are altogether different.
They say the population is getting killed for us by default.
If anyone dies from the population, it is considered murder.
May peace and blessing of the Almighty be with you.
I was coming back to my shop after the Isha prayer tonight and a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called me over.
I thought that this man was probably lost or wanted to ask me a question. I looked in and his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked me if I could speak and understand Arabic, and I told him that I could.
He started telling that he came from Riyadh when he was in Medina someone picked-pocketed him and he needed help. I gave the man 12 riyals so that he could reach Riyadh, but I saw him telling the same story to others as he drove up a little farther.
I became furious and cursed at the man and threatened that I would call the Police.  Upon which, he ran away.
This is the situation of many Muslims these days.  By begging with families they can make at least 2 to 3 thousand a day.
However there is a clear Hadith (SAAW) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one.
May Allah bless us and make us true Muslims (Amen).
Wassalam.

The wife of famous singer Adnan Sami went to a Police Station in Mumbai, and accused him of torture.
The Police Station advised her to approach the courts about the subject.
Saba Galadari the wife of Adnan Sami accused her husband Adnan Sami of continually abusing her
and he is also administering in human behavior against her.
Now this thing has gone out of her tolerance, therefore, a case may be registered against Adnan Sami.
Police  station has advised her to approach the courts as the case is not within the valid jurisdiction of police station
Do you think that the abuse accusation of Adnan Sami by his wife is accurate?
Could this accusation be an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Tell us about your opinion on the subject.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
As far as allegations are concerned, anyone can accuse someone else.
Nothing comes before prestige.
However the relations between Adnan Sami and his present wife may be, he left his respectful life and went to India to make money and now this fame has caught him badly.
This is a consequence of his own deeds.
Washington...
Top American officials say that president Obama will take a strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
In the new American policy over Afghanistan, there is more emphasis on war than development.
Officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achievement of American goals.  In his government there is corruption, drug business has increased, and Taliban are regaining their power.
American officials say that the people who are putting more pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more include Vice President Joe Biden and President Obama's representative for Afhanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke.
He said that the strategy came forward after President Bush left. He participated in video conferences with Hamid Karzay every fortnight. Those conferences emphasized America's role in reconstructing Afghanistan and its cities.
American officials say that the Central Administration under Obama will work with local leaders for a change.
Officials say that they will stress the fight against corruption, joining hands with the Karzay administration.
Hamid Karzay will soon face a new election, and it is still unclear whether Obama and members of his cabinet will support Karzay's candidacy for the presidency of Afghanistan.
Will the appointment of an American official cause any significant changes in Afghan policies?
Can we predict whether Hamid Karzay's rule is coming to an end?
What do you think about it?
Sri Lanka beat Pakistan in the three one-day international cricket match series 2-1.
In the first one-day match, Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka. However, Sri Lanka won the remaining two matches.
In the third one day match the performance of the national team was too awesome. The team chasing a target of 309 runs of SriLanka was able score only 75 in 23 overs.The national team should thus have learnt a lesson from this defeat.
From the results of the series, it's evident that the national cricket team's performance is not consistent.
Despite home field advantage and predictions of success, the national team suffered defeat. Why do you think this happened?
Which aspects of the game should experts focus on?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
Do you place responsibility for the loss on the fielding, batting or bowling?
Share your opinion with us.
Malik Babar Husain, Jeddah. It is unfortunate that these ignorant traditions are prevalent even in today's modern age. If the landlord or property owner targets innocent people with a harsh dictatorship, who will call them Muslims?
Let any big shot walk on these burning coals. Why does the government allow them to do this?
When will we find justice through the courts?
The Sri Lankan cricket team arrived in Pakistan to play the one day international series.
It is happy news that the foreign team is still coming to Pakistan regardless of tension between India and Pakistan
On arrival at Karachi airport, the SriLankan team was given a warm welcome.
In between Pakistan and Srilanka, two matches are being held at Karachi, while one is at Lahore.
Both teams are claiming assurance regarding bowling, batting and fielding.
Srilankans are proud of there Spiner, while Pakistani are believing in their fast bowler.
Srilankan Captain, Mahela Jaywardena, has said that not one player on the Pakistan team, but rather the whole Pakistan team is dangerous.
Murlidharan and Mendas will be our Trump Card.  On the other side, Pakistan's captain has said that the competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik has said that we have played Murlidharn and will see Mendas as well.  They have developed a secret game plan which they will show at the ground.
Do you think the Pak-Sri series will be entertaining?
Whose side is heavier in the Pakistan and Srilanka series?
who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Let us know your opinion.
Gulfam, London, Publish statements that are of liking, you give preference to those too, it is our wish that even you write some truth, do not entangle the statement like Mukher Jee because it is commanded to say truth in front of tyrant and it is equal to Crusade(Jihad). What to say of Mukher Jee, change the statement between news and try to weep.

All the people of Kashmiris have been fighting a war of independence for the past sixty years.
No, no one  asked, now they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism. They have started talking about peace and settlement.
First they generally massacred Muslims, now they are perplexedly settling the matters.
In any way Pakistan has to understand their deceptive policies.
Asad Khan London
India creates such situations that the focus of the world turns away from Kashmir.
But Pakistan always shows India's real face to the world.
Now the British government also understands that India gave Pakisatan a bad name with regard to terrorism to take the focus away from Kashmir occupation.
and frustrated to talk this matter with Pakistan
British Foreign minister David Milliband said that by resolving the Kashmir issue, terrorism will be eliminated and the government of Pakistan will be able to handle new challenges impressively on its border.
It's clear that newly elected American President Barack Obama previously gave his thoughts in the same vein.
British foreign minster while talk with media and writes on one essay that though of fight against terrorism is wrong for challenge of danger for its own safety killed people is the policy of Bush.
David Milliband said that Pakistan did not have a soft spot for terrorist groups.
Due to pressure from big powers to resolve the conflict of Kashmir, is India trying to create an intense environment in this region to take the focus away from this problem?
Could Mumbai terrorism be a part of this conspiracy?
Does India want to use terrorism as a mean to avoid an attempt at dialogue?
Let us know your opinion.
Usman Aftab
I think it is the big countries that want to harm Pakistan.
In fact, the big countries are thinking of means to control Pakistan.  They know Pakistan is an atomic power.
They want to create an environment of revolution.
Foreign counties are thinking that if Pakistan is cornered, that will pose more political and geographical problems.  They want to help Pakistan and want to achieve their vested interests at the same time.
A citizen of USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition of keeping 'a walking stick in arm and the name of Ram on one's lips.'
I think from time to time there is anxiety.  In order to relieve that, Pakistan is blamed or associated with some negative event.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.
Faheem Siddiqi
Ras al Khaima, This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but they  know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is now deep waters.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden, played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers movement not played any role?
What do you want say about the words of the Prime minister?

The President of America, George W Bush, told Barack Obama that he in his position made many mistakes and if Obama wants to correct them, he can.
As president, based on the situation and on the rules and regulations of America, I have taken steps,  I work only for the benefit of America.
He said stopping the enemies of America from attacking America is the biggest challenge facing the Barack Obama administration.
He said he was unable to find the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, which was his biggest mistake, but he felt that he won the battle in Iraq.
In the last conference at the White House he said "this is my last press conference, and I thank all those who have attended."
Do you think Obama will repeat the same mistakes that Bush made?
Was Bush too late in accepting the mistakes he made?
Will Obama succeed, in Bush's opinion?
Aware me about your openion.

This is the most dangerous situation where Israel kills Palestinians, on the other hand the same in Kashmir also, it was not noted by any peace councils, and not even responding for this
The Associations in Kashmir and Palestian, there have to fight for their freedom, and they to be united and struggle to all dangerous situations. definitely one day their struggle will give you a good result. Insha Allah

An important Political Person of HAMAS Nazariyan was killed along with his family.
the other side the functions of  peace councils got closed, without any conclusion
The conference was conducted against Isreal by Libya and other gulf countries, and the report was submitted to America
In the last few days, there have been bombings by Israeli aircraft upon Palestinian civilians.
The whole world cried out about the Mumbai issue, but the Israeli attacks do not seem to be regarded as a massacre to anyone, including America and Britain.
Why are the important Islamic countries so quiet?
What do you want to say about this double standard of the world?
Saeed, New York.
I think that, actually, most of our people are illiterate. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to serve its own interests, the electricity and gas crisis will not be regarded this way.
This is because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has been regarded as very serious.
On the other hand, there was an increase of an average of 18% in gas prices, while the unavailability of petrol in some cities has become a source of lament for the public.
Among the manufacturing and business circles, there are strong protests and severe reactions going on, regarding the lengthy power outages and gas crisis.
Industrialist have given an ultimatum before closing the factories.
Here there is growing anxiety among those dwelling in  Karachi because of eight to ten hours electricity load shedding.
Industrial activities have been almost paralyzed.
Government departments are playing a blame game on each other.
Under these circumstances, aren't the proposals for increasing electricity and gas tariffs a joke on the people?
Why is attention not being given to resolving the issues?
Can't the government see the failing of the country's economy?
To counter these problems for the short term, what suggestions do you have?
Please inform us about your opinion.
Imran Khokar from Madina Munawara Saudi Arabia, I want to say that people get leaders who are similar to themselves.
I am surprised that government is carrying slogan of public service is itself hurting them.
The unavailability of electricity, gas, and petrol has become a persecution.
Government has no control over the institutions.
Law and order is deteriorating every day, may Allah bestow his mercy on this country.
The new year has started.
Last year was the year of outbreaks and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered in reference to the terrorism.

The new year is arriving, how do you foresee it?
In your opinion, what will be the result of the political or geographical situation? What will be Obama's strategy?
Is there a hope of a development towards eliminating terrorism?
Is the judicial crisis of Pakistan done?
What shape will the Pakistan-India relationship adopt?
Is there a chance of surgical strike or full scale war?

after ruling America for 8 years, president Bush has departed from the White House and shifted to the president camp office in Camp David so that the White House can be renovated according to the new president Barak Obama's likings.
During Bush's eight years rule, the historical attacks and destruction of the World Trade Center, attack on Pentagon and then in the name of war against terror, attacking Afghanistan and Iraq and involving forces from other countries into the war and use of American resources in it have become memorable examples of his time.
due to this war America itself faced the worst ever economical and financial crisis in history.
what do you think the world achieved and lost through this war?
were the policies of Bush successful?
What is your opinion on president Bush's rule?
The Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, in an interview with Jeev News said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour. Due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step? Should sports not be separated from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision not harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that the security condition in India is bad, the England cricket team is continuing it's tour, so why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this?
Salman, Karachi.
Those people who are proud about going to India.
They make their films and videos over there, their eyes should open now, as to how much the people of India respect you.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami should return to Pakistan first chance he gets because respect did not suit you there either.

Indian's attitude has changed after Bombay Attacks.
Jagjit Singh has showed in  his reaction  that he hates Pakistan and Pakistani.
One should know that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsley. How is he a bad singer now? Adnan Sami should stay in India, there is no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshaad Alam
Karachi, On the statement of Jagjit Singh, I would only say that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! Open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Bombay incident, their hateful statements have increased. The same people are now saying evil things against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to foreign news agencies, in the farewell trip of American President George Bush, during a press conference with the Prime Minister Nur-al-Maliki, in his office, the situation became hilarious when an Iraqi journalist called Bush saying "Dog, this is a farewell kiss."
After this, the journalist took his shoe off and threw it at Bush. President Bush ducked with expertise and saved himself from getting hit by the shoe.
The second shoe hit the American flag.
Security agents pulled this journalist away from there.
On this occasion, President Bush said that he did not know why he did that, the shoe was a size ten and he was not bothered.
In your opinion, does this action of the journalist show the anger of the Iraqi public against President Bush?
What do you say about this incident?
After the Mumbai terror incidents, the tension in Indo-Pak relations escalated to a grave extent, when Indian Air Force war planes violated Pakistani air space in the Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
Due to the reaction of the Pakistani Air Force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
According to sources, both Indian planes were full of weapons and ammunition.
This is the first incident of this kind  in the current tensed situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that they are all set for country's air defense.
Information Minister, Sherry Rahman, says that Indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed. Although this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
In your opinion, does India really have the intention of an air strike on Pakistan?
Is this statement of India correct? Was this violation  a mistake or was this to find out the ability of Pakistan Air force?
Is this incident going to aggravate the current estrangement among the two countries?

On this occasion, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations Abdullah Husain Harun and other senior embassy agents were present.
What do you think about the former martyr Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto receiving this award?
Samir
Chicago
It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she completely changed.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party and made her son the representative of the People's Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi, This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
But until the iron ax is fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are just like this, in that they are adopting secretive ways. This is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations has included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed and two other Pakistani citizens, and that of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organizations in their list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, the practically non-existent organization Lashkar-e-Taiba's Operation Chief Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi, and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, a Saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek, was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organizations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, Al-Rasheed Trust, and Al-Akhtar Trust International.
The host countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organizations, and they will be restricted from traveling and will be placed under arrest.
They will have to face charges.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India accusing these organizations of responsibility for the Mumbai Attacks without any proof?
Doesn't India have any local terrorist groups ?
Aren't the world organizations aware of the persecution of minorities in India?
