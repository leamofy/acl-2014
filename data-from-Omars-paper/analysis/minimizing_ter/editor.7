He said that there was proof available that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design.  Later, documents were received from Libya which also verified this fact.
When asked whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.
He said that he also believes that Israel has access to the results of this testing.
Thomas Reid was also asked about China's nuclear distribution program which is ongoing.

The central headquarters of Jamaa'athud Da'wah is in Taibah, about 25  kilometers from Karachi.
This center includes a hospital, a school, and a hostel for students.
The law minister of Punjab, Rana Sanaullah Khan, says that supervisors were appointed in the center of Jamaa'athud Da'wah, so that the work of social institutes there goes on unaffected.
According to Khalid Waleed, son in law of the Jamaa'athud Da'wah chief, Hafiz Saeed, a high ranking government officer, Khaqan Babar, was appointed as the administrator for the supervision of the hospital, school, and other social institutes based in the center, while according to him, the posting of police at the center was also increased.
The Security Council has passed a ban on Jamaa'athud Da'wah, after which the Pakistani government has started taking action against Jamaa'athud Da'wah across the country, and has put the chief of the Jamaa'ath, Hafiz Saeed, along with other leaders under house arrest. The appointment of the administrator in the Taibah center by the Punjab government was also a part of the action being taken against Jamaa'athud Da'wah by the joint government.
Khaqan Babar belongs to the DMG, i.e. District Management Group.
Hafiz Khalid Waleed said that the Commissioner of Lahore division, Khusroe Pervez Khan, along with police and the civil government, came on Sunday and inspected the Taibah center. Khalid Waleed spoke badly about the appointment of an administrator by the government in Jamaa'athud Da'wah, and he said that the number of patients in the hospital and children in the school had already dropped due to government actions.
Here, according to a press release by Jamat-ud-Dawa, the party's chief Hafiz Saeed has written a letter to the General Secretary of the United Nations, Ban Ki Mon, and Committee for Taliban, requesting to cancel the restrictions on the party made by the Security Council.
It says in the letter that the one-sided decision of the Security Council on banning Jamat-ud-Dawa is unfair. And Jamat-ud-Dawa has no relation with terrorism but is busy with the activities of charity.

Bitterness between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Nearly screaming, Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Israeli president that the blood of many humans were spilled in Gaza, and it saddened him to see that people could watch this armed killing from Israel and clap in agreement.
Mr. Erdogan said that ""I believe that you are using such words to publicly ease your guilty conscience.  But you killed those people, and I will not forget those children who were killed near the shore.""
Simon said that Gaza's calamity is not due to Israel, but rather Hamas, who have established a dangerous dictatorship over there.
A BBC journalist from Davos said that he had never seen such a scene in an global economic forum before.
However, Erdogan later stated that he respected the aged Israeli president, falsely claiming that he was not yelling at him.
Turkey is one of the few Muslim countries which has a diplomatic relationship with Israel, but displeasure has been materializing between the two recently.

It might have been some other land; definitely, not Britain too.
these are the two places (Pakistan and Britain) about which I was worried.
India and the international community have created a lot of pressure on Pakistan to take actions against the culprits of the Mumbai attacks.
Wajid Shamsul Haq said: we are not trying to cover it up.
we believe in taking action based on facts.
the world will accept our investigations.
we will try to satisfy India over the results (of the investigation)

The Role of EU for Peace in the Middle east.
From the official point of view, the role of the European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
According to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
The European Union's spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, has said that every such effort is appreciated which is helpful in sending the European Union's message to the opponents of the war.
It seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned.
In reality, the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
As the head of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is even weaker than before.
Also, the internal issues have made it helpless.
On the other hand, the French President, Sarkozy, is behaving as if he is still the President of the European Union.
France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role, and he is capable of it, but he does not have the permission to do so.
The most comedic situation is for the Ambassdor of France Mr. Bernard Kouchner.
Mr. Bernard Kouchner is also involved in this, with guidance from the Ambassador of Czech Republic, Mr. Schwarzenberg.
This is not their only difference of  opinion, they may have to face a battle with the western world
they said that for the defence the Isreal they might has to face the war, even though it doesn't appear like that,  on the other side Germany also posted a person towards the east side. till Europeoan Union come to an conclusion, they wont win the battle
This is the proof of Isreal, which doesn't provide any response to the European Countries.
This is the best time for the European Union to perform, because America has failed in the western side. by the law of Goerge W bush

The aim of advertising is always to sell the product or let the people know the various facilities made available to them either at the market or at their doorstep.
When a product is being advertised we are able to gather more information such as its name, price, benefits and availability.
But sometime the drafted messages tends to be fictional, owing to either exaggeration or to false claims made by the advertiser. Viewed objectively, the advertising message must act as a salesperson and do its best to convince the consumer of the merits of the product.
The words used in advertisements are typical of a salespersons' language and this is how he would like to convince his prospective buyer, should they come face-to-face.
The name of this advertisement is Ratiopharm. The words used by the salesperson definitely praise the product or service that is available.
More often, they are colorful and catchy words as they persuade the customer to respond favorably and force him to purchase the product. Unless cosmetics and other like Kassbohrer products are heavily promoted, they will languish unsold on the shelves of stores for a long time.
So, advertising always puts forward the best points of the product. Advertisement can be educational, entertaining, informative, handy and surely interesting.
At times, however, they tend to be boring, irritating, incredible and embarrassing.
Another category of advertisements tends to brag so as to tempt the buyers.
But whatever it may be, advertisements have a two-fold purpose to serve. They have a message to convey and they attempt to evoke a desirable response in the buyer. As a result 400 VEM product become popular ones and the demand increases.

According to Interior minister Joachim Herrmann of province Bavaria this is a superficial positive change.

He said that his province will also consider this while collecting statistics
A part from Bavaria the same is being planned in Hamburg.
A senator for foreign affairs from CDU, Christoph Ahlhaus, has said: "When research is done in a scientific manner, man can not pre-decide its results but it is based on the facts and figures that come out as a result of the research."
Ahlhaus diverted attention to a research report from the anti-crime provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamburg, it was discovered that out of all crimes happening there is a percentage that have the involvement of foreigners.

Tthe crime rate was less as compared to crime all over the province.

was 7 percent
However, other political parties of Germany for example, SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei,were against this proposal that while collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired which German citizens have foreign backgrounds.

The martyrs include 275 innocent children. They embraced death smiling at the faces of deceitful Arab leaders and the organizations pretending to be working for international human rights.
The Israeli troops were forced to leave Ujain in Gaza today because of the strong resistance of the masked Palestine soldiers. They exhibited magnificent defense with the help of their strong faith and desire for sacrifice. They engaged in a do or die battle against the Zionist enemies.
But for the treacherous stand of the Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, the brave and solid fighters of Hamas would have thrown the Israeli troops into the pit of shameful defeat. Unfortunately, the Egyptian Muslims also kept the Palestinians under siege along with the Israeli troops. It is the most tragic incident in the history of Arabia.
It can be seen that Saudi Arabia and the Udar government extends political as well as financial assistance to Israel. Similarly, they join hands with Israel to deceive the Musalmans of Gaza who are put in unending miseries.

In response to several questions asked about Israeli aggression in Gaza, President Bush replied that Israel has the right to protect herself but Hamas does not and Hamas should not attack Israel and like America the whole world should strangle the oppressed instead of the oppressor.
America's most incompetent and ineligible president said that Hamas should not be provided arms however America is giving the most devastating weapons to Israel who are using these weapons in the genocide of Palestinians. Also criticized pro Israeli Arabs and declared them friends of Israel.
Bush was embarrassed about the crimes committed in Abu Garib and Guantanamo bay prisons.

Iranian President Ahmedi Nizad regretted the silence of Arab countries.
According to all news agencies Iranian president Doctor Ahmedi Nizad has strongly criticized silence of Arab leaders on the Israeli aggression and oppression.
President Ahmedi Nizad is shocked on the silence of Arab countries and their leaders on the Israeli aggression on Gaza and said that Israel is doing Holocaust of Palestinians, terrorizing Palestinian children, women and ordinary citizens.
President Ahmede Nejad has called upon all the Arab countries to unite against Israel and to save the oppressed Muslims of Gaza from Israel's harm and tyranny.
Ahmade Nejad: "Saudi King should clarify his stance on the  genocide being done in Gaza by Israel."
According to the report by MAHAR/MEHR news agency, President Ahmede Nejad in his message to the Saudi King Malik Abdullah declared that the King's silence on the human genocide in Gaza and on the murder of innocent women and children is encouraging the enemies of Islam.
President Ahmede Nejad has said in his message: "You should show your true stance on Gaza and declare support for the oppressed so that the enemy's attempts to plant disagreements in the Islamic block will fail."
In his message, President Ahmede Nejad said "You know that for the last 19 days Israel has been bent upon human genocide, murdering innocent children, and subjecting homes, mosques, schools and hospitals to barbaric bombing. The Zonist Regime is brutally murdering the unarmed Muslims in Gaza. In situations like these, silence on the part of leaders like you is only encouraging Israel."
President Ahmede Nejad has told Malik Abdullah that even non- Muslim countries like Venezuela and Bolivia have taken concrete steps against Israel and that he is expected to take better steps.
President Ahmede Nejad told the Palestinians that success will be at their feet in Gaza.
The oppressed will win over the oppressors and that's Allah's promise.
President George Bush: "Terrorism is still a threat to USA."
The US President, while addressing his successor Barak Obama and the nation in his farewell speech, said that the US is safer than it was seven years ago but the threat of terrorism still looms over USA. (MEHER/MAHAR news agency, with reference from the German news agency)
Bush said that because enemy terrorists are waiting patiently to attack America and have a strong determination to do so, America should never be unaware about its security.
The American president ignored the pain and suffering of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza and defended his policies, saying that America is still the biggest supporter of Gaza's independence. However, commentators do not accept the reality of the unpopular president's remarks, as America is neither a supporter of freedom, nor a supporter of human rights, but rather is the most mischievous country in the world. Not only does it support a blood thirsty country like Israel, but it is also directly involved in its crimes.
The Israelis openly kill woman, children and other civilians. Despite this, the American president is congratulating them. This is the American humanity and freedom which the world is seeing in Gaza and other places.
Usama Hamdan: Presence of army in Palestine continues
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, Usamah Hamdan,  the Hamas leader in Lebanon, told French News Agency during an interview that a one-sided ceasefire from the Israeli side is against the comprehensive international efforts for a ceasefire. He said that as long as Israel is present in Gaza, a one-sided ceasefire is meaningless.
Hamadan said that the one sided ceasefire was an unsuccessful effort of Israel to escape defeat. He said that if Israel wants long term peace, it will have to accept Hamas's conditions as well as end this siege.
He made it clear that if Israel tries a one-sided ceasefire with its army remaining in the Gaza belt, there will be resistance.
Addressing a one-way conference from Beirut, Usamah Hamdan called for European nations to break ties with Israel.
The Hamas leader said that the increasing numbers of the martyred and injured will only increase our determination.
He also told the Palestinian public to stay firmly rooted and resist the enemy like a boulder.
Taliban Killed 6 in Pakistan's Tribal Area North of Wazirastan.
Meher Reporting Agency copied references from Rueters that the Taliban killed 2 Afghans and 4 Pakistanis over accusation of espionage in Pakistan's tribal area of north Wazirastan.
According to reports, on Tuesday morning locals found four dead bodies from Tehsil Chowk in Tehsil Mir Ali, who were shot dead.
However, two of the dead bodies that were found in capital Miranshah were thrown in the market of a Bazaar.
Letters written in Urdu have also been found near the dead bodies in which it is claimed that the dead were involved in espionage.
Also, two weeks earlier, in Miranshah, the capital of north Wazirastan, two Afghanis were killed over accusations of espionage.
Over last twelve days, fifteen people have been killed over charges of espionage for America.
It should be noted that during last six years, more than a hundred people have been killed in South and North Wazirastan on accusations of espionage. Taliban members are accused of being involved in these murder cases.
Obama Expected to Undersign Closure Orders of the Infamous Guantanamo Bay Prison.
Mehr Reporting Aagency has copied through sources that state that today the American president will sign the orders of the closure of the infamous Guantanamo bay prison.
The new American president, Barack Husain Obama, started working on his campaign promises at the surface level.
In this regard, President Obama called for making a plan for recalling the army from Iraq, while the American president will sign an order today to close the notorious Guantanamo Bay prison.
It is expected that President Barack Obama will probably sign the order today by which the Guantanamo prison will be closed within one year.
Apart from this, the White House is expected to revise suspected terrorism investigation methods and ban ill treatment of prisoners during interrogation.
President Barack Obama started to fulfill his election campaign promises from his first day in office, and first of all started by taking steps toward making the actions and workings of the government transparent.
Experts say that the American president has started making efforts to save the declining image of America throughout the world, but that would be difficult, because as long as it will keep supporting the blood thirsty Israeli government, it can not be expected to do anything good. Therefore if America wants to save its image, it will have to stop its support of Israel and have to disassociate itself from Israel's crimes.
Tony Blair stresses the need to include Islamic organization Hamas in the talks.
Mehr news agency quoted from British newspaper The Times that former Prime Minister Tony Blair stressed the need to include Hamas in the talks to bring about peace in the Middle East.
According to the newspaper, Tony Blair said that it is important that a path be found for bringing Hamas into the Middle East peace process. Blair criticized the Bush administration for speaking only to Mahmood Abbas and ignoring Hamas. It should be clear that the western countries have realized the democratic and organizational powers of Hamas and are calling for bringing them into the talks, whereas previously they used to consider it a terrorist organization. A terrorist organization which is trying to defend its country and struggling to save its own house from the clutches of others. Whose house and country have been in the hand of the occupying Israeli government for 60 years.

One should not forget that the most lethal terrorism occurred in Punjab, where PMLN is the ruling party, and my established team needs the cooperation of the government there.

Afghanistan: Voter registration in danger.
The Afghanistan Election Commission has said that due to safety concerns, it is delaying the voter registration in some of the southern regions.
The voter registration for the upcoming presidential elections had started this week in South Afghanistan.

Extremism has been on the rise in those regions of the south, where Taliban rebels have increased attacks on Afghani and international governments.
Meanwhile, the Afghani army and international armies are claiming that during the night between Wednesday and Thursday, during small skirmishes, they killed at least 28 soldiers.

According to officials, an American jet fired three missiles near a house in the area Mir Ali of North Waziristan, killing ten.
According to local officials, there were five foreign fighters among the dead.
This area is considered to be the central hideout of the Taliban and Alqaida's fighters.
A few hours later, southern Waziristan was also attacked with a missile, which left at least eight dead.
Apart from the disagreement of the Pakistani government over the course of six months, there have been almost 30 additional missile attacks in Pakistan.
These attacks did not come until after U.S. president Barack Obama came into control.
Bush management has abstained from accepting or rejecting these attacks.

The dead persons have not been named yet.

The province Sarhad's government refused to comment on the question regarding the ban on girls' education.
Province Sarhad rejected the threat by Taliban soldiers in Swat, stating that this announcement is against the law and against Islam.
The prime minister of education in province Sarhad, Sardar Hussain Babur, stated that the government will not allow these efforts.
He states that the extremists want that the children in our areas left free from education.
In his words: ""These people try to secretly blow up schools and frighten the boys and girls""
Talking about the environment of fear and insecurity, he said that the local government knows well and wants it to be known that no force can stop the spread of education in the land of the Pukhtons.
One day ago, the Taliban soldiers, led by Moulana Fazlullah, had demanded that girls be banned from studying in the Swat's educational institutions beginning on the 15th of January.
Despite the military activity going on in Swat during the last one and a half years, about 150 educational institutions were destroyed by the militants by the use of explosives and arson.
Due to the destruction of these educational institutions, thousands of girls and boys were deprived of an education.

Tea: A potential cure for breast cancer?
According to new research, drinking three cups of tea every day
reduced the chances of breast cancer by more than one third  in women less than 50 years old.
In research conducted by the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida in the United States, it has been found that women less than 50 years old that have the breast cancer oncogene
reduced their chances of breast cancer by 37 percent among those who drank three cups of tea a day.
The research indicated that older women did not get any benefit from drinking three or more cups of tea a day.
The researchers think that the tea contains polyphenols that are effective against the type of oncogene in the breast cancer that affects women younger than 50.
In Moffitt Cancer Center, in the city of Tampa, Florida state, a research was conducted on over 5000 women, who had undergone treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles with women who were safe from breast cancer.
The experts also found out that on a specific type of cancer called lobular cancer, the drinking of tea has shown clear effects, and has decreased its occurrence by 66 percent.
A tenth of every breast cancer patient suffers this type of cancer.
This type of cancer is more dangerous because it is deeper and is usually only known after it spreads quite a bit.
Experts say that regular tea consumption, at least three cups a day, can drastically reduce the occurrence of breast cancer in young women.
They say that making tea a regular beverage taken on a daily basis and included in ones daily activities causes the suitable defense required against cancer in the body.
In Britain, every year, approximately 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer.
The biggest military challenge facing the American war in Afghanistan is gas.
American Defence Minister Robert Gates says that the biggest Military challenge for America is the war in Afghanistan.
Today, Gates is giving a briefing to the American Senate and the representatives of Congress on the Obama Administration policies on Afghanistan and Iraq wars.
Gates told the Armed Services Senate Committee that war is not the only solution to Afghan problems. He also said that in order to make many areas secure, Army Personnel will not be available. The Taliban are taking advantage of this.
Why Do We Exercise Less As We Get Older?
New Research
Exercise is Good For Your Health, No Matter How Old You Are!
This keeps the heart healthy, reducing the level of cholesterol, and keeping weight low. It also helps in the reduction of sugar and reducing Alzheimers so the speed of dementia will decrease.
Unfortunately, in many older people, the capability to carry out exercise is low.
The specialists say that, with exercise, our body and brain remain active. Age can have an effect.
The American Medical Association says that Many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out.
Dr. Patrisha Pae Leka of the Meo Clinic in Mani Sotta says that the reason for the addition in the age is from inability of exercise and less functionality in the body.
Dr. Patrisha is a medical professor in the Meo Clinic.
It was Dr. Patrisha who performed the research on heart-related illnesses in the elderly and the the benefits of exercise.
A team of doctors used a sonogram to test the functions of the heart.
Using the sonogram, they studied the integrity of the blood pump in the heart as well as the heart's palpitations.
The experts had given full attention to the left side of the heart, which is the more important half that pumps the blood through the body.
They came to know that as people get older, the heart is forced to work more to aid respiration.
Dr. Patrisha says that as people age, the heart's job in assisting respiration becomes harder, and the effect becomes more obvious with the inclusion of exercise.
Dr. Garven Ken also participated in this research.
They say that we were surprised to see that this thing is effected necessarily and with this it has been clear that bad exercise functionality has an affect on the heart's respiration work.
High blood pressure can cause cardiovascular diseases and certain dysfunctions.
If doctor and patient cooperate with each other then exercise can be beneficial even in old age.
A detailed report has been published in the Journal of the  American Medical Association.
Indian Army Chief Declares Peace with Pakistan
Indian Army chief, Gen. Depak Kapoor said,"There is a fat chance of war with Pakistan. However, we are ready to protect our national interests at any cost".
General Kapoor feels that despite international pressure, terrorist networks still exist and are active on Pakistani soil.
He was talking with journalists in Sri Nagar.
Indian Army Chief is on a one day visit to Kashmir Valley to observe the  activities of Armed forces at the boundaries.
He was asked to comment about Pakistan's rejection of Indian evidence about Mumbai Attacks.
Gen. Kapoor said that political leadership is responsible for dealing with issues relevant to peace or war.
There are many types of common riots and protests in Pakistan.  He also reported there would be a tremendous battle between India and Pakistan.  Pakistan has aimed to weaken the Indian Army.
He has also reported there are 700-800 army troups in Kashmir, of which apporximately half are not citizens.
General Deepak Kapoor has reported there is some improvement in the K.I.K.'s atmosphere. He has also said he has increased efforts in the battle on Pakistan Dependent Kashmir. Therefore, we have increased the number of Army camps on the Indian borders.
He has also reported that he has increased the number of army troups in Indian Dependent Kashmir. He has clearly notice from their actions that there cannot be any compromise with regard to the protection of the country.
Oh God, please accept our prayers.  Please prove Barack Obama to be good for this world.
It is evident from the present situation that there is a slim chance of getting a positive response.  Still, we will wait and see to what extent the Pakistan-American relationship changes and what benefit it can be to us.
What inspiration does Presdient Barack Obama give to this world compared to the inspiration and aims of Martin Luther King, Jr.?
Obama, whose name is partially Hussein, is going to take the Oath as an American Leader.  He is going to be a protector of the country and of it's history.
This will be a test not only of their community, but also for all those who have supported him with their heart and soul.
This extreme test will will occur on white paper.  It is not easy to write sincerely that he will rule the country with justice on blue paper.
Here, South Asia, especially Muslims who have expectations from them, should remember that he has been elected as the president of America. And Obama should remember that the American president is actually the president of the entire world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th president of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have to have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, so this will be a victory for people who support him.
What will be its effect on South Asia, and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change affect the relationship between America and Pakistan?

Dear, whether it is Obama or someone else, the decision of the policy of the entire world is done by the Jewish lobby of  billionaires, influencing powerful people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts, the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is obvious to everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat that had a regular Army and Law.
He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a  pact.
It is a matter of sorrow that our government treated Swat like a step-mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government by the ruler of Swat.
No interest was taken in the building and development works.
The girls who are getting educations today are much fewer than those who used to get educated in the previous era.
In the Frontier Province there is a continuous targeting of educational institutions by the Taliban.
Most of the schools that have been destroyed in district Swat are the girl's schools.
It is not just that, but the Taliban has imposed a ban on girl's education.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.
What do you think the goal of the Taliban is by wanting to end the education of women?
Why can the Government not stop these unlawful acts?
What efforts to you think the Government should make?
The question is what benefit is there for ISI and Pakstani agencies?
The people of Swat understand the "game" being played by the military in supporting the Taliban instead of killing them, evidenced by the fact that in Karfuo, 5 schools were blown up and people were killed and hung by the road.
When there is no authority of government left, then how can the government stop unlawful acts?
The question now arises, with all their advances in technology, destructive weapons and an effective network of spies, how is is the Taliban still have not garnered control?
The answer is that some unknown power has a hand in events.  That is why their weapon supply never stopped and they aren't ever arrested.
The conclusion is that the Taliban and their deeds are making it easier for World Powers.
The war in Afghanistan has been ongoing for the past 15 years.
ISI was controlling Taliban while it's opponent, the North Coalition, was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Suddenly, the situation changed and the Taliban began to act.
ISI was also offered American fundsing, so past friends became enemies.
Now,the war continues, but Iran, India and Russia are still helping Pakistan.
Human will keep making mistakes until a feeling of what is right and wrong emerges.
For example, a thief will still steal until he believes stealing is a curse and there is punishment for it; until he fears from God, then that Human will steal.
Likewise, unless Israel inderstand it is wrong for it to drain the blood of innocents, and that there will be  punishment for this, it will keep playing Holi with the innocent blood of Gaza.
Respects!
Question whether the war, armed movement, and terrorism are solutions to problems.
If not, then what are the specific actions that will provide solutions to these problems?
The truth is that war does not solve the problem, but instead makes it more difficult.
Palistine, Afghanistan and Iraq should the adopt the methods used by Nelson Madela in South Africa to achieve success in their methods.
That mean there should be behaver and politics efforts in more then force.
The participation of the public in the Kashmir election suggests that they accepted this view.
This is the third week of Israel's attacks on Gaza, and the dead total about 1000.
The war could not be stopped with the efforts of ambassadors until this time.
An estimated 9000 Palistinians have left their homes for safer places since the attacks began in December.
Charitable organizations blame Israel for failing to care for the mental and emotional problems caused to Palistinian children.
What do you say?
Is this the way it should be?
How is long term peace possible in Gaza?

Give a chance to the Taliban.
Basit, Peshawar.
Wake up! If the Taliban will perform a real Jihad, then who will sacrifice innocent people?
Who burned down the girl's school?
If kidnap for ransom, or not getting ransom so who will hang people on the pole by called them American spy?
The Taliban has done more damage to Islam than any other nation or religio.
Pashtoon roar
Kohat, Pakistan.
If all of the Muslim world would attack Israel, or simply issue a threat to do so, then they would see how painful it would be for America, the Godfather of Israel.
Then, a true cease-fire would be observed.
But what should we do about the cowardice of the Muslim rulers?
Someone should ask Ahmadi Nejad to become the first to attack, as he is well-known for his bravery.
The struggle for peace and human rights is not the sole responsibility of Arabs or the Muslim world. It is the duty of the whole world to raise their voices against cruelty.
This sad incident is the worst crime committed by Bush.
In India and Pakistan, the financial corruption becomes greater at the end of the fiscal year, while the Bush administration has permitted Israel to do what she wants.
On one hand, America demands the cease-fire.
On the other hand, the United Nations is passing resolution after resolution, but action-wise, has done nothing. There is only one meaning of this, and that is that the even the United Nations is openly in favor of destroying the Muslims.
All Muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the United Nations, and should establish their own global organization.
We have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations are seen, but the harm is only done to the Muslims.
What is the use of these vain efforts if BBC does not want to publish anything?
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically of Muslims, is spilled, the monster of unbiasedness gets onto BBC's back.
It considers itself the standard bearer of truth.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments from Muslims.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments from Muslims.
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, and the likes of you stay among Muslims, and call yourselves Muslims.
[syja786]
For a long time on BBC forums, suicide bombing and other types of terrorism in India was used to target a certain sect.
The favorite word of these Anti-Islamic discussions was Extremism.
You can get a very good idea regarding who might be an extremist from the above discussion because writing against Iran was almost considered blasphemy.
When will our muslims understand that the Anti-Christ can not be fought with swords.
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what shall one do other than crying?
The basic fault of this turmoil and massacre is that by naming Jihad results in to blackening the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of Palestinians accepted the existence of Israel, why did Hammas need to fire those rockets on Israel and make suicide attacks?
The attitude of both sides is against humanity.
Once again, the role of the UN and the USA was seen as favoritism towards the injustice of Israel.
May Allah give the muslim nation the understanding of becoming  united. Amen!
As a matter of fact, think about giving the Noble Prize to the terrorists for carrying out these painful terrorist activities. In the campaign against terrorism, eventually the actual work is being done by them.
Otherwise, is it possible to carry out terrorist activity on such a massive scale without the assistance of chiefs and without every one knowing who is pulling their strings.
Such a situation can be termed as high handedness, "Do what ever you can".
The strong men first, it beats over the head but do not let one cry.
The Arab rulers are giving medicines for the injured, funeral clothings for the dead and money and they are asking
Should the Israelis continue the attacks?
The actual problem is that the rulers of Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia are dreaming undutifully while asleep. Neither do they have an army nor do they have any defence plans, they just think that by providing aid they have done their duty.
They should immediately take practical steps against Israel.
Like cutting off the oil supply to European countries and America instead of feeling sorry for them.
Regards to all brothers and sisters.
I think asking Hamas to give up their struggle for the sake of peace is unfair to millions of widows and orphans. It is the same as failing to them.
If the Pharaoh-ism of US and Israel is on the rise then Moses will come to counter them because every Pharaoh has a Moses.  The American and Israelis actions are producing suicide bombers among Muslims.
The ability to think and understand has abandoned them.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Now Hamas and Israel should cease fire to stop bloodshed.
Mohammad Sarfraz, Paris, France
Rightly said.
Suppose Hamas is on the right path and struggling against cruelty for the sake of God's will: they should know that an act of goodness does not remain good if it harms others.
Love for humanity is the precondition for earning God's and his prophet's love.
It seems God has asked to annihilate all those who are other than Muslim.
Najeeb-ur-Rahman Psycho *Lahore* [Pakian]
No! It is not decreed to annihilate, but it is decreed to invite people to Islam.
People who have conspiracies against the religion are decreed to do Jihad against them.
One should fight with them until they finish their conspiracies, but this certainly does not mean that they can wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the consequence of a murder of children is disaster.
It's a request to my friends that yesterday Israelis did not have a roof over their heads and today they are so strong that they do not listen to anyone because all Jews are one.
They do not have Shiite nor Sunni, all are just Jews, and they have succeeded in every field and made everything.
Opposite to this, what is the condition of 55 Islamic Countries?
By lagging in every field now the condition is that they are so helpless that enemies are killing them and they are waiting for their death.
The point is that all Muslim countries should get together and should make a plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better action plan than this, to accept Israel and to learn modern science and developmental ways from it, and allow the world to live in peace and serenity.
Muslims have a lot of land and resources.
The need is for proper utilisation.
First, the part that hurts the most is there could not be unity between Hamas and Al-Fath.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were systematically killed to weaken the nation. The only region which is still fighting for Masjid Aqsa, and this was not possible as long as Yasin and Arafat were in the way.
The world is watching how Palestine is getting scattered, second by second, after the death of these two leaders.
The Jewish lobby is increasing its reach, second by second.
In 1974, Pakistan had a Prime Minister of such global credentials that for the first time in the history of the country, he gathered all the Muslims leaders, with a 100% attendance, under a single roof.
Today on his 81st birth anniversary, is it a very difficult task for the people to pledge to keep unity, not only within their ranks,
While eradicating the differences between other Muslims, the formation of an Islamic common wealth will be carried forward.
It is a monster that has gripped Palestine for half a century.
This monster has many faces.
Many times, this monster criticizes itself from its own different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
Its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This monster is most unhappy with Islam, because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out it will be through Islam. Muslims and the perfect religion of practical Islam, have put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
Bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since the 27th of December.
More than three hundred Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
After the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
Through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
However, Israeli officials claim that they will continue their action in Gaza until they are convinced that Israel will be safe from rocket attacks.
In your opinion, is the statement by Israel, that this is an Israeli struggle for safety, acceptable?
In this situation, is the global brotherhood doing its job?
Can this inhumane action have a direct relation with the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can there be any expectation of improvement in the Middle East situation, after the newly elected president Barack Obama takes office?

Zaheer Chughtai
In the Pakistani electronic and print media, some Urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone, and cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the "grudge of Muavia" written on them.
has said that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. how long this hypocrisy will continue.
Why is so much oppression being done on the Muslims? If people such as Americans do not stop supporting the Jews, then Allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support, and then see what kind of life they will have.
The just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If any tribe could be erased by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained from the killings, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.
These are the words of a poet.
Oppression is oppression, the more it's done the more it is erased.
Blood is blood, the more it falls, the more it gathers.
Now who can tell who did terroristic acts?
Is all of this not included in terrorism? Why then does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocents not red?
And why is there no one to send a message of mourning from anywhere?
I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.
I see dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood. How shall we condemn? I can not find words!
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims. On one side people are being killed in India so the rest of the world comes over to Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations that we will do it ourselves!
On the other side, Israel is killing generations of Muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent. This is unbearable!
There is delay but not ever in the house of God. Only then will this darkness shed.
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Considering elections, the rulers should these activities for people's support. There is no doubt in this, especially when countries like Israel exist. Rest talking about Barrack Obama, then history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy. Regime, whether black or white, is a regime.
The debate going on in the forum makes it clear that every one is sad on Benazir's death. As a politician, one can not ignore her mistakes.
This talk requires debate on whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was so dear, then  why was it left in 10 year dictatorship of Musharaf until American clearance and the deal?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when people affected by dictatorship needed her. Unfortunately she came to Pakistan when she was assured by the government that she will be freed from trails.
There is no one remaining to say about the criticism and accusations of a historical personality.

Somethings should be ignored because nothing can be done about them.

How bloody is our Nation and in our parties excitement while writing the Epode they will be blind but now every historic people is trying to pinpoint an accusation and criticize the judious, but on this there is no one is tell any thing
We have achieved lot of success.

Few things can be avoided by thinking that nothing can be done. For this in the same  as if we put books on a donkey. He will not become a professor.
After the attack on Mumbai, a problem got created between Pakistan and India in there regular activities but still India and Pakistan have to continue there regular activities
If we talk about War, then at the both end there will be a loss of human beings.
India is saying that the person who got arrested at the time of Mumbai attack is a Pakistan citizen and he has written a letter in Urdu and sent to Pakistan. But at the other end India has first said after arresting him that he is a big Engineer but after that they have proved that he is just 4th standard Pass, point to be observed
First of all, to Mr bhana and all western friends of this forum, a happy Christmas.
Colleagues of the forum: Mr psycho, a raza, sister Sana, sister Shahedah Akram and to all Adaab (salaam, greeting)
We do not want the flames of war, we want the flowers of peace.
War in itself is a problem.
What problems can war solve?
It will give fire and blood today.
It will give hunger and need tomorrow.
Therefore, O intelligent people,
If war keeps getting postponed, it's better.
In your and our porch,
If the candle keeps burning, it's better.
Indo-American relations have now gotten quite deep, and India knows with certainty, that America will openly betray Pakistan when the time comes.
This is also the old history of America.
In the case of the Indian attack, America would get its' goals and the expense would be on India as well.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation or ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied, even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
This is the Islamic history.
Even before this resolution, the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it more clever than effective and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction, the world community has relaxed its' pressure now.
While ignoring India's unnecessary bobbery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a "Side Effect" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
There are no two opinions over this that it is a heinous act.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past year?
How many Taliban are killed by thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday?
I appeal to the I.S.I, that for God's sake, stop monitoring the Taliban and let us live in peace in our heavenly hometown Sawat.
And stop this phony operation.
The day is not far when a resolution about Pakistan's military intervention will be passed by United Nations, just like the bill which was passed against Jamat-ud-Dawah.
Riaz Ahmad Farooqi
The extremists of our country and their supporters themselves are constantly providing all evidences and justifications required for instigation of action against them, and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is passed, in all likelihood, not a single voice would be raised in United Nations, in our favor.
And supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.
We are not aware and familiar with the character and achievements of Pir Sami-ullah and what his activities were.
Maybe he was not a revolutionist.
Like the dead bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, Doctor Najeebullah and thousands of other revolutionists have been subjected to dishonor at the hands of the enemy.
They are immortal even after they die.
But there is a international game being played here in which the public is ruled by fear through barbarism and ferociousness.
So that license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will clutch the government.
These acts of so called Islamic activists in the name of religion is without limit worthy of condemnation.
The supporters of extremists can see the injustice of America, but instead of expressing grieve on those dishonest acts they clearly shun them by giving them the name of tribal traditions.
Sometimes by cloaking in tribal traditions, sometimes in the name of Islam, no pious man can give reason for such dishonest acts.
In my view, our Army is associated with theses people.
When these people move from a place, it takes so much time that they can be caught.  There should be time for that, but it's a stretch that they get there on time, even if they are there, they are long gone.
Are they so merciless that they kidnap fifty seventy men?  And our Army stands by like a spectator.
They are servants of Allah and so is our Army.
There is something wrong at the bottom.
Malaiat, in the period of the dictator of the time Zia-u-Lhaq, did not show good characteristics of sympathies of Allah, but there is various tortures in the name of religion and more in his writing: "What will be done after death."
And such persons use this fear as a way to get the world's respect.
Speakers                                                                                                                                                              ""preachers""
You frightened the world with the fire of Hell.
That you became the image of fright.
Upon it wondered that when it is said that it cannot be a Muslim action.
We ourselves do not know this history or cover it for any purpose.


Was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
Motives cannot be diminished and correcion cannot be made without accepting reality.
O' BBC please stop this dual-headed policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
A human was pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office?  Please show some modesty.
the success of Operation Sherdil and Operation Lion Heart across the border depends on who is in the favor of public opinion.
This is an act of American and Pakistani agencies and Peer.  Sahab is a victim of this conspiracy.
Now that secret agens have successfully joined the Taliban and they are doign what the can to change public opinion, all discussions on this forum will now be anti Taliban.
I would like to ask only this. What were the soldiers doing when the corpse was kept hanging throughout a day? were they sitting there to aim only the common people? It is said that Taliban hideouts were bombed and a woman and two kids were killed when a house was attacked.    I would like to ask this: what were the soldiers doing when they allowed a corpse to hang throughout the day?  It is said that two Taliban hideouts were bombed.  A woman and two children were also killed when a home was attacked.
Why? Didn't they come to know about this great tragedy?    Why?  Didn't they already know about this great tragedy?
Were they leisurely having fun, or not?    Were they leisurely having fun or not?
Let us fold our hands to you in a request. For God's sake, stop this game.    Let us sincerely make a request: for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler who watches over all of us.    This sounds good.
Though the question raised from the B.B.C. is substandard, it could only be felt pity at the poor quality of the writers. For instance, nobody asked this. What were the 3000 soldiers camping at Swat doing ?    Though the questions raised from the B.B.C. are substandard, one could only feel pity at the poor quality of the writers. For instance, nobody asked this: what were the 3000 soldiers camping at Swat doing ?
The helpers of the army were hanging on poles the dead bodies of those who fought Taliban.    The helpers of the army were hanging the dead bodies of those who fought the Taliban on poles.
The cheating done to the commoners by the Pakistani soldiers is done, but, it is not right that the medias including B.B.C. has concealed the fact from the world.    The Pakistani soldiers have already cheated the common people, and what is done is done, but it is not right that the media (including the BBC) has concealed this fact from the world.
The Pak soldiers are playing drama.
Every child in Swat whispers that it is a bloody drama.    This sounds good.
Stop this drama for goodness sake!
These Taliban members have destroyed the image of Muslims.
If the real Muslims don't accept the Taliban as Muslims then they become refugees in their own places.
The ones who are shameless and don't do hard work and labor take arms in their hands and join their group.
Islam doesn't spread through swords and guns.
Have shame.
It's baseless and has no roots in any religion or in family customs.
All media including the BBC show different views on Taliban and tribals.
In fact, nobody knows the actual situation except us, because we are the natives.
(  sorry was pretty hard to translate)
This move has shamed all Muslims.
I salute Altaf Hussain of the MQM and the leadership of the ANP and PPP, who speak out against this cancer that is the Taliban.
This cancer is a product of the late Zia-ul-Haq, who managed to destroy Pakistan before he died.
But I am hopeful that the current leadership will remove this cancer.
After the Mumbai incident, India said that extremists were behind the attacks.
Pakistan, rejecting the accusations, said that it will help India's investigation in every way possible.
India said that it has submitted a "wanted list" of 20 suspected extremists to Pakistan.
Pakistan has said that the list includes Jaish-e-Muhammad's Molana Azhar Masood, who is not in custody and about whom the government of Pakistan has no information.
Before that the president of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari rejected the view that western spy agencies and the Indian government had provided evidence related to the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari has said that it has not been proven that Ajmal Kasab is Pakistani.
During this, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that the its relations with India are not going to improve if its land continues to be used for terrorism.
And in the latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should sports be affected due to these political events?
What future to you see for the India-Pakistan relationship?
Neither America nor India could break Pakistan.
Pakistan could only be broken by the Pakistanis themselves.
What do you expect after such regionalism, communalism. and vandalism?
Even Jinnah, too, did not do good for the Muslims of India. Time has proved this.
Yasmin, Chicago
Madam, if we had kept working on the vision of Jinnah, the cancer of Communalism, Regionalism and Vandalism would not have spread in Pakistan. And also the Muslims of India would not have been treated this way.
It is our mistake of not producing a leader of his caliber.
If only we could pay respect to our heroes.
This region has great potential.
God knows when this region will learn its lesson. Its unity will bring prosperity.
Both countries have extremist forces, such as the Taliban and Shiv Sena. These extremist forces are the enemies of the peace.
The imperial powers do not want peace and stability in this region. They are controlling these countries like puppets.
Can you imagine the potential international influence of Pakistan, China, and India if they were to be united?
Pakistan is under the occupation of corrupt and opportunist leadership.
May God protect our country, Pakistan.
Being Pakistanis, we should not neglect the ground threats. American forces have been deployed near our Afghan borders.
Besides this, the situation in the country doesnt seem to be stable, like in the NWFP, Baluchistan and Sindh, and the problems in Karachi are also evident.
In this atmosphere, we need a leader that can unite the people of this country.
O God please show us some mercy.
I believe we have no other option but to go to war one last time.
Enough is enough.
It's now or never.
These fraudulent dialogues and pointless meetings are not the solution to the problems.
Neither is committing small scale terrorist acts in each others territories.
After all, it was only after waging the Second World War that Europe managed to sort its problems out.
And if it wasn't for this World War then they'd still be arguing and nagging each other over small things.
Almost all of our political parties are unified in the idea that terrorism and sectarian violence shall be eradicated from the country.
However, our own military leadership does not seem to be sincere in this assertion. On one side, Europe and America are assured that the military is sincere in achieving a terror-free state, but on the other hand, the military aids the Taliban covertly.
Now we have to think, define our path, and select one path to focus on. Thank you.
There is no doubt that the elements of Jamat-ud-dawa include a majority which belongs to Lashkar-e-Taiba, a banned organization which is now established and operating with a new name: Jamat-ud-dawa Pakistan.
However, after more focus was diverted towards humanitarian activities on India's strong request, the United Nations has also banned it. The government of Pakistan has also implemented a crackdown on this organization.
In my opinion, if these Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and focus on religion and humanitarian assistance, then it is much better.
The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan which have used the name of Jihad to recruit and nurture professional killers and criminals and their molana's are the same people who called Pakistan "Plaeedistan", meaning unclean land. These are the people who use bad names for Pakistan.
Now they are trying their best to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they don't even get close deserving the term Muslim. In fact, they deserve to be called animals or barbarians.
Pakistan's security will be at risk until these extremists are eradicated from Pakistan.
Should we still believe that the innocent people will be charged with rules and regulation?
In this furious world the job is war, their work is only to kill.
With this news my heart is broken.
What type of world is this in which it is very difficult to follow the preachings of Allah's Islam.
Non-Muslim can kill Muslims, but when Muslims try to take revenge then all non-Muslims along with the whole world think that Islamic preaching is done with Hafiz Sayeed.
India is very upset about the attack on Mumbai.
Citizens of Pakistan have created the misunderstanding between the two countries and in the coming days the situation will worsen.
India always blames Pakistan's terrorist group.
The upcoming problems on the Taluk have been stopped.
The Indian security centers have blamed Lashkar-e-tayab for the Mumbai attacks.
In this case, the name of Jamat-ud-Dawa has come to the forefront many times.
This is the first time that relationship between both the countries has worsened due to terrorist activity in India.
In December 2001, after the attacks on the Indian Parliament, these two neighbors were on the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
Now it is about Jamat-ud-Dawa, which Security analysts say that is in reality a new face of Lashker-e-Tayyaba. Restrictions on the party are being requested.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan conduct decisive operations against extreme activists on its land?
By banning Jamat-ud-Dawa, can  the current Pak-India crisis be brought to a close?
And how important is it to close down the armed groups to keep constant peace between both countries?
The Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all, what proof does the Security Council have to decide this so quickly?
Will the Peace Council ever show any alertness against the Muslims any time?
For this it is said that when the accuser is lazy the witness is active.
If see; India itself has become one useless realm.
Whose intelligence, army and other security officials have become useless, who for 72 hours has danced the dance of mole with terrorists and India is cheating the world by blaming Pakistan over its uselessness.
If one disbeliever dies then the whole world knows about it- why is this double accuracy?
To the dear nation of one nonpolitical, religious, farming organization
Farqaan Farooq, Faisalabad
Until our Prophet(Peace be upon Him), great ancestors, and Sufism give the human beings the love and respect. The religion of Islam was more vast growing and ripening from peace and sparkle.
The Muslims also got promoted in every field.
But when this beautiful Religion rose to the hands of distillation then within the human beings began the difference of religious and disbeliever and the new gateways of pride and prejudice began to open by which the world was unknown before.
Salute, sir! Salute happily, but get your work done on your own.
Do not do it because of American pressure.
Let India show it is having difficulties.
Why does it not give?
And why do they accuse us of everything?
Even in India, there are fundamentalist groups and organisations.  Why aren't they restricted?
Are we the only terrorists in the whole world?
What is India doing in Kashmir?
What is Israel doing?
The truth is that we are the first Islamic Nuclear State. Is this what the fight is about?
Pakistan is on the verge of breaking up.
Kamranhassan, ABU DHABI
You are right, and circumstances are supporting your argument.
Now even American magazines are publishing new maps of Pakistan. These sanctions are the part of greater game plan.
Gradually, the USA is making its grip on Pakistan stronger.
In this situation, if we don't become a united nation, then the history of Bangladesh's creation will be repeated.
Terrorists' attacks should be condemned, whether these are committed in Mumbai, Islamabad, or Philistine.
Terrorists should be uprooted without any discrimination with regard to nationality.
The question arises as to why Pakistan and other world  powers remain silent about the terrorist attacks in Pakistan that killed hundreds of innocent people.
Was the attack on the Marriott not an act of terror?
then why-
hail to the Interior Advisor Rehman Malik, how brave and bold has he become.
no image
not only this, but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under 'someones's pressure'.
wow, all praise to the Almighty!
whether having the ability or not or to say that I don't want.
We, Pakistanis are fighting whose war.
and why we have our own interests, which we shall do our best to protect.
No one has a right to interfere anyone's national affairs.
The colonial system is apparently not there.
If people are sure to have justice or Allies support the importance of free judiciary and give respect to democratic institutes and dont support the dictatorial governments; peace can be achieved in third world countries including Pakistan. But this is not acceptable for allies
Pakistan is always in line with European and American interests.
Pakistan is forced to do so, even though a majority of its population opposes it.
This enhances the opposite or anti sentiments.
If America and its allies believe in democracy, they should give up their colonial behavior and leave this region.
Pakistan has the ability to arm or disarm.
Security forces searched a camp of Lashar-i-tayba in Pakistan that was  administered Kashmir.
After the Mumbai attacks, increased pressure is being put on Pakistan to take actions against extreme outfits.
India blames that Lashar-i-tayba had role in the Mumbai Attacks.
The, American foreign minister, Condalisa Rice, asked Pakistani leadership to take practical and transparent actions against those responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
He believed the terrorists involved in the Mumbai Attacks were from Pakistan.
Meanwhile, the officials in Peshawar stated that more than fifty trucks have been burned by some unknown armed personnel. These trucks were going to Afghanistan with goods for NATO forces.
This was the second attack on American supplies during the last forty-eight hours.
Meanwhile, Pakistani police cracked down on a camp of Lashkar i Taiba, a banned organization. Already many efforts have been made to disarm the extremists. Even money and indemnity were offered.
It is clear from the circumstances that efforts remain unsuccessful to dislodge the armed groups funded by Americans and Saudis during the Afghan war. It means efforts to restore pre-80's Pakistan are fruitless.
The question arises whether Pakistan wants to do so?
Does Pakistan have an ability to do this?

I have only one question for the standard-bearers of the world-
If you kill their children, will they come to praise you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from the Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill the innocent public, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in the negative, then you really need to examine your point of view.
The people were armed when there was the fear that Russia would head towards Pakistan after finishing in Afghanistan, and that is why they were supplied arms.
Now, when there is the fear that America will capture Pakistan via Afghanistan,as the American president  mentioned in his presidential address, why should we disarm them now?
Only so that after defeating the American or Indian army, it does not have to face any resistance from the public?
If any of them are guilty of being involved in any destructive work, Pakistan can take action against them alone.
It is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved, proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it's still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
Another question is that were these terrorists supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or trained in Pakistan, and not any other country in the world?
As for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the present terrorism is in no way connected to it.
It must be remembered that Hafiz Saeed is the first 'Jehadi leader' who called the Taliban actions 'mischief'.
I'm sure that the Taliban effect is a inseparable result of American plans, and hence every person who can stand in the way of the Taliban must be removed.
Despite the support of the whole nation, the fact that Zardari and co. took action against the Lashkar is a clear sign of their frigid and kiss-up nature.
To stop the project that is running on Saudi-American funding, they must be requested themselves to regather the filth that has polluted our society.
we will protest against them about the ethical way America and Saudia has distributed Dangerous weapons and so called Jihad but actually they have distributed hatred literature and cultural virus which has created a human slaughter houses.
after the threat from India to attack Pakistan, Pakistan Military announces that he will pull his forces from Afghan border and put it towards India. Taliban also announces that they will take care of the Afghan border which resulted in a chaos In America and he Forced India not to do war with Pakistan.
In this Letter all the musket of American Power was exposed
in contrast India has never threatened nor it has the power to attack
the remaining damage is done by the Taliban by attacking the American convoy
this proved that without Pakistan Military and Government Of Pakistan support, America is Nothing
Karachi, Pakistan's Main Business and Finance City which is Dubai of all the rural areas
Million never returned from here with empty hands, but when western areas law and order situation is worsen all attention is directed towards Karachi
now they want to hijack this city
for the first time Pathans are called by Pakhtuns,which is making city's people as stranger and fighting among each other, but to be united is necessity of time
One solution to this problem is that either the Urdu speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun speaking people learn Urdu, or better yet, both learn English.
You might think that this is a funny proposal, but does the cause of the conflict not seem funny?
That the cause of extremism be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, I actually shared this proposal many times in my childhood with my friends, which included people from all religious and linguistic groups, but these people used to laugh at me.
At that time, the religious and linguistic hate, which was not as lively and strong as they are today, were still developing within.
I can never understand what is happening and why.
Are these the signs of the Day of Judgement?
For what crime are innocent people being killed?
The reasons are in front of everybody. Those who want to break up Pakistan are the active ones, and those who do such things, have neither religion, nor country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns
Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir mean that is what is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
At the height of the Mumbai attacks, efforts to cause mischief on linguistic and racial lines in Karachi failed, which is proof that those politicians working on racial parole have resigned from their jobs.
The taking of the lives of innocent Pushtu speaking laborers, and the Indian warnings have awakened the sleeping Pakistani feelings from Karachi to Khyber.
The identical country loving reaction of all the political, religious, linguistic and national parties has not only taught India the manners of diplomacy, but it has also given the American policy makers a chance to think again.
The responsible parties for the worsening situation in Karachi are the United and the ANP. The government is taking sides.
The government can control the situation in one hour, but it is purposely allowing it to grow.
The police and rangers are avoiding action because of the pressure on them by the political parties.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
Situations like this will continue to occur until political pressure is applied consistently on the management. Allah keep Pakistan safe.
In my opinion, they are the biggest terrorists.
Of course there are external forces at work here, but no one knows who they are.
Saddest of all is that had this situation occurred somewhere in Sarhad, the government would not have acted as it has; but when not in Sarhad, the government is completely helpless.
The government should intervene here and save one of the country's largest and most important cities.
Otherwise, Pakistan will face massive economic setbacks.
Even BBC Urdu is too scared to write the truth, although the state of the Pakistani media is even worse.
The complete truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to this problem would be for Urdu speakers to learn Pashto or vice versa, or better yet for everyone to learn English.
You might consider this suggestion ridiculous but isn't the reason for the conflict also ridiculous?
Language may be the reason for persecution.
Another story of murder, long dreaded by all the citizens has finally been published in Karachi.
The criminals seize any opportunity to commit a crime. The media are only telling 50% of what actually happened here in 4 days.
Citizens have spent three sleepless nights. Clearly the fear is still present.
Those who make the people evacuate hotels, those who kill the shoe-makers and the peanut-sellers.
Those who rob and kill at the Super Highway, and cut off the ears of innocent citizens are ignorant of the wrath of Allah which will eventually entrap them.
In your opinion, what is the cause of this sudden turmoil?
(B.B.C)
In light of the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai, we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the cause of the disorder in Karachi. It seems that the turmoil is due to an unconscious trade of blood.
Obviously if someone infuriates the father, it would not be surprising for the son to react violently.
The blood of the loyalists of Liaqat Ali Khan also belonged to the same place. To eliminate Mr. Psycho's misunderstanding I am writing this verse.
We will also repeat our elders' traditions.
We made it by sacrificing lives and will save it by doing the same.
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
it is very disappointing that whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
See Liaqat Ali Khan and you will will find out that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family from Karnal in Punjab.
Due to his steps for the migrants, today the migrants consider him as one of them.
There is always a reaction to every action.
One can afford on oneself but.
Ejaz Aiwan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the graffiti of real gangsters these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan. They did not face any reaction.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
One Muslim League Q was left, and even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to the People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment to the National Assembly and the Senate.
Until now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment are a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in favor of this amendment, nor has anyone forced the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like after submitting the drafts of the 18th amendment, these parties have done their part. That is, they will be able to say tomorrow that they submitted the draft and the government speaker did not take any action.
MQM the government, Muslim League N in the opposition and Muslim League Q was the party who passed 17th amendment so how is it possible that these parties will be sincere in finishing the 17th amendment.
This is called getting credit for nothing.
The People's party is not in a hurry about finishing the 17th Amendment.
How can someone think of cutting their own hands?
The 17th Amendment will not be canceled until Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of the majority in our survey.
If the 17th Amendment was discarded then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf, because being the president also makes him the chairman of the People's Party.
The 17th Amendment will not be valid until he is the president.
In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to wait until Zardari leaves the office of president.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
Most of the elders in our family belonged to the working class.
During our childhood when our uncles did their work, we prayed to Allah to protect us from physical labor.
To avoid this we wrote to the editor of monthly Amroz to ask him what to do after matriculation so that we would not have to do physical labor.
In reply, the Editor wrote that we should become a Doctor or Engineer and study these courses.
We were inclined towards engineering and in matriculation we studied Technical drawing instead of Biology.
But at the time of admissions in FSc, our older brother forced us to study medical in FSc.
We had hardly studied biology for a month before we started studying math.
In order to avoid physical labor, we became engineers and we are in a better position than many friends in our family. We thank Allah for it.
We remembered this when with out 2 young sons we were trying to lift carpets of old hour.
It hasn't even been half an hour while we were working that the small son said, "Daddy it seems that I am not born for this job".
We said, "If so, study well like us and build up your body".
The son started saying, "I am studying already and will study more but this work is not done by me".
Anyhow, us three managed to complete the work within three hours and returned home.
The meaning of the saying is that if a man decides on one destiny then whatever comes afterward will not stop him to accomplish his destination.
Yes, and if you don't really know what you have to do then Allah is the only protector for you.
There is a saying that never say bad things for a dead. At the first death anniversary of Benazeer we only see bad in her.
Benazeer, for her own benefit, forwarded to India the Sikhs' army who were to fight the war of independent. On one side the independent movement of the Sikhs was collapsed and on the other side, they gave a chance for India to concentrate on Kashmir after pushing down the Punjab movement.
Distraction from the leadership of Benazeer and Nawaz Sharif have pushed the country to many years backwards.
During exile, Benazeer continued on keeping the series beneficiary information of Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
During the rule of Benazir, she gave her husband the freedom to make as much money as possible, which is why he is known as Mr. Ten Percent.
During Benazirs' rule, her brother was killed, but the murderers are still safe from any punishment.
Besides being a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for womens' rights.
Just like Benazir took over politics upon the death of her father, her widower has taken over politics at her death.
Benazir came into power twice, but she could not punish or register a case against  the culprits that murdered her father.
It has been 37 years since East Pakistan has been separated from us, but due to the extreme senselessness of our people and leaders we have never celebrated the mourning day.
Instead, we should have celebrated December 16th as Didactic Day and take measures so that this kind of incident doesn't take place again.
On this day we send greetings to the people of Bangladesh as we try to bring them closer to us again.
The rulers should reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
There was once a plan in place to make bring back the Bahari's who were stuck in Bangladesh and send them aid to assist them and raise their moral.
But now there lacks compassion and initiative to continue acts of kindness and good will. We have become so concentrated on our own lives, we unaware of deaths of our neighbors.
We do not care about our friends, relatives and countrymen because, we have become selfish and self-centered.
Even if a massive natural disaster occurs, we are too busy in our daily routines to take notice or show any care for those in need from one day to the next.
Only if we could find a way to re-unite East and West Pakistan and both states could be together as one; just as East and West Germany were brought back together in the 1980s.
We can be a sovereign state of one again if each state sacrifices for the better of unity by relinquishing their selfish ways.
But this thought and hope of many does not seem to be possible in the near future.
When it was announced in the news today that the Governor of the American State Illinois was arrested for alleged corruption and misuse of his political powers
and the State Congress started actions to remove him from his position as governor immediately, we have American politician who has close ties to the circumstances of Pakistan, boastfully claimed to our government and nation that this is what we the United States calls democracy.
In America, even the politicians and the elite people can not break the law and get away with no consequences.
And the other is your country, Pakistan, where even the president was chosen after the corruption charges against him were dropped.
My vein of loyalty throbbed and I said what is the big deal if a governor was arrested in America? In Pakistan, once the prime minister was arrested and hanged overnight, and another time sent into exile.
Tell me, when did this happen in America?
In Pakistan, those who broke the law were sent out of the presidential palace with a guard of honor. Tell me when this happened in America.
The chief justice of Pakistan was removed in such a manner that, despite having public support, he could not be replaced until now. Has this happened in America?
In Pakistan, a fake-degree holder was made the minister of health. Did this happen in America?
Hearing this, the American laughed until he was tired and conceded defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded on all four sides by Americans.
It seems from his smile that he thinks that America is with his government.
He is forgetting that one year ago, they were with Pervez Musharraf.
Thus psychotherapy gained popularity.
Whether there is madness in method, or method in madness, there is certainly a method in dealing with madness.
That said, mental health care has come a long way from merely addressing dementia, to dealing with problems such as stress, depression, anxiety and relationship problems.
When she finished her MA in counseling psychology from Columbia university.
The center offers support services for depression, anxiety, stress, learning problems, and personality deficiencies.
Material problems and workplace issues.
It also offers employee assistance programs for corporates.
There are enough opportunities in the fields of counseling and psychotherapy.
Traditionally both roles were played by psychiatrists, who not only counseled patients.
Research has revealed that there are conditions which can be cured without medication.
Instead of using power, the government should be finding out the real sources of this problem.
The Fazalullah and Taliban will dissolve into nothingness if the root causes are terminated.
The Shariat bill suggested by the ANP administration will, to a great extent, bring a solution for the problems in Swat.
But, in addition to the observance of the Shariat law, the administration will take care of the well being of the people.
The actions of General Musharaf led us to believe that we had been freed from the unqualified politicians of the land but, his ambition for more power changed everything.
How many expectations were there! He lost all hopes in "War and Terror".
Hopes of taking actions were lost.
It seemed that he understood that the end of his reign was imminent along with the end of Bush administration. As a result, thieves were recruited to power centers.
General Musharaf was in a position to control the army ,but the present administration does not know any of this was occurring.
The army could not put down the terror in Baajodoh and Swat. The commoners are subjected to "bombardments and enmity" i.e, resulting in great loss of lives and property. It also puts them into psychological disorder.
In Swat, the strongly affected part of Sarhad state, despite the continuity of military action for over one year, the situation is still going from bad to worse.
On one side, the government is only reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly. On the other side, the Taliban's illegal radio FM channel is having much more influence in the region.
On the third side, the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region.
During the action of the security forces, there were claims of destroying the fundamentalists by the bombing of gun ship helicopters and cannon houses, but despite these destructions, the Taliban only became more powerful, and according to an estimation, their control over Swat increased that much more.
As a result, on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat, and on the other hand the Taliban is getting stronger.
Who are stuck in between? The poor civilians.
It is said in Swat, that someone asked what kind of people the Taliban were, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of Allah and the religion'.
Then he asked how the army was, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country'.
He then asked who the enemies of the religion and the country were, so he got the answer, 'We civilians'.
I am wondering how the Pakistani Army will fight the Indian Army, when they couldn't control a small faction of the Taliban.
They couldn't track down Taliban's illegally operated FM channel which in my opinion is very easy.
In the mean while still the FM was spreading hatred in full swing.
After the girls school's now it's the boys school's that are being destroyed.
Curfew is imposed so that tablibans can move around easily.
Tonight eight trucks entered the suburbs of Mingora during curfew and created bunkers.
The question is that how could they reach there destination during curfew?
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house and salute the  Taliban.
For God sake someone tells this Army to protect helpless people of Sawat from Taliban and prove that Pakistan army can overcome any enemy.
He says that most of the blood is spilt in the name of religion. Tell me if religion was not then blood wouldn't have spilt?
Punjabi, Pathan, White, Black, Mehsood and other tribes are these the products of religion?
No not at all. The religion teaches that there is no white nor black, there is no Punjabi nor immigrant. If there was no religion then people would have destroyed each other and other things in the battle of black and white.
The religion only teaches the man how to be disciplined and mannered. Religion only shows the man that he has not come by himself instead he has been created by the Supreme Power God and He has sent you in this world to lead a life as per His orders.
Being a Muslim I am very sure that Islam is a complete religion and moreover it is a true religion.
Even after the time I acquired the luxuries in London, I continued to call up my relatives every morning to find out about their good and bad events. Even though my relatives never bothered to call me ever in my life, I still  continued to do so. But when I felt that my relatives didn't even like my calling them, I stopped making calls to them.
Even I have felt the same here since I have spent two years in France.
Why the people keep expecting only from us to make a phone call to them in Patna?
Regarding Iraq, within a few hours there would be an Army sent for the "peace" in Darfar. This is not a problem for them.
The post action after the Mumbai Blasts and the security in the areas are a matter of few hours.
There are discussions and opinions on the matter where there are more risk to death in the areas of Mumbai through any sources.
Hey you, the Protectors and leaders of the peaceful world, life is being ended here only in the discussions.
is it really being waited to diminish.
so that no could again even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights.  (this is a fragment, we don't have a topic...why or who?  what was the action?)
when a father is running, carrying his beloved son's dead body, even then, your hearts don't pinch you with pain?
If not then, you don't even deserve to be called human being.
You become a black mottle over the name of humanity.
So at least it has been proven that this region has also been a homeland for Jews for centuries.
Ideally these two nations should have lived in harmony, but  their strings are in Western and Arab hands. So without their own will, peace can not prevail in this region.
And even now Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
Even if the Israeli operation stops temporarily, Tension is so high it will start again any moment after any incident.
BBC's own country has its interests related to America and Israel and this is why while taking cover of enlightened moderation, it has started a series of blogs on Jewism and this creates biased propaganda.
BBC is only completing a formality, and its goal and intent is to gather well wishes.
I request the moderator to publish this comment of Fidwi, so it be known that at least a little bit of affinity towards truth is still remaining in BBC
Thank You.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, Dracula's have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How could I not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time, including Derah Gahzi Khan, summer showers are taking place throughout the country.
A poem on climate is presented to you. May you enjoy the sweet rain when you read this poem.
It rains just because of you.
Whatever rains is the spring.
Whatever comes to a standstill is tranquility.
Sometimes it comes for no reason.
Often it spreads wide in the night hours.
Sometimes quite noisily, often silently,
It rains.. but just because of you.
Whichever cherished memory, whichever night,
A suppressed music!
Sometimes, he put it out.
Sometimes, he lit himself up.
Sometimes, every drop carries sorrow.
These rains are quite like you.
All of these leaders are about to ruin a sensitive case because they do not care if the country survives.
The people should be selling their possessions or wiping the temples clean with lemon peels.
Our leaders and the media are both corrupt.
Its sole purpose is to extract money from the government.
And the people are oblivious of this.
An odd incident took place yesterday at noon.
Police are running here and there, but don't ask about illegal parking.
What's more, NYPD traffic was not able to look at illegally parked vehicles.
Something like this happened, when a plane of US Air really became a ship and landed in the Hudson river.
Until now, we only thought that terrorists are of the descendants of geese.
Yesterday was perhaps historically cold in New York.
The temperature does not fall this much.
Even my jaw started hurting from my half an hour walk outside.
Imagine how the people who jumped from the plane into the river would have felt.
It is a matter of luck that all people were safe.
And it was sad that the company's plane sunk during this financial crisis.
I went by West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, in my one hour trip, the way had opened just a bit, so I was able to get onto the 56th street exit.
I had not taken the previous two exits, seeing the lines of traffic there.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, congratulations. Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women
Shaguftah: Well, congratulations. Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I have slaughtered two chickens. How I did it, Jahanzeb has already mentioned.
Besides this, there is no other way.
At this farm, one has to process his own meat, including removing the skin.
Bossom: It may take some time for the dot net to get fixed
What happened on the forum?
Linko.
To fight with the "Listen to the blog", use Firefox.
Duffer: Khair Mubarak! Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sir please use Firefox.
It will snow till it disappears.
For no reason had we thought that the Taliban group from Sawat was non religious, who were only against women education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
But like majority of the ideas, this was not proven right also. According to this news of CNN, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a Boys school with gunpowder.
The Taliban has destroyed a boys school in Swat.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First".  I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation of the Taliban being against girls education is not true.
Rather, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government less.
May He help them in uprooting the evil government.
Amen, Amen.
Masha Allah, up until now 182 schools have been destroyed.
The stories about various Muslim customs like fixing marriages before birth, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the supposed statements by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight, were not exaggerations.  There was recently a news story from India about a girl who was married to a frog.
See a picture of the bride at the marriage.
Some days go, a girl's marriage with a dog become fresh.
see that now
Humanity is rare in 21st century.
It is the age of the computer. The computer occupies a place in every walk of life.
Many people have objections over interference of computer as its role in financial matters.
Although credit card users have facility but their personal life is under more control of law enforcement agencies.
Now much of a person's financial matters can easily be tracked by using credit card records.
In the future, when usage of currency will become less frequent, the computer's importance will increase.
In the crime world risk is not as often taken to rob banks. Now credit card information is stolen.
In addition, friends are also made through computers.
Social networking sites, like Orkut, Facebook and Myspace are accepted by many now.
But do you not think that the more we are following these social networking sites, the we interact with people in real life?
Similar problems can arise when using the match making websites, where your desires are matched with others desires and you are shown a list of the people who match with you.
Can you lead a life with a person who is just like you?
I can not. That is why a spouse is called the better half.
He/she will help eliminate my faults.
Perhaps I have achieved some small degree of wisdom.
I used to believe everything my elders said.
In the same way, I thought that my father knew the answer to every question on earth.
I used to get laughed at a lot for this.
But only that saying seemed true, which is possible.
Mad?  Why not just tell the truth?
Bore did not understand this saying inspite of his age.
So I am trying to tell the truth about this as much as is possible.
Do not misguide someone by lieing and then attaching Allah's name in order to appear honest.
And, Allah willing, say only when there is a prayer to Allah that work is completed.
Allah knows the true intentions of someone.
This is a disgusting problem which is created because of a distance from religion.
According to law of both Pakistan and our religion, minor children should stay with their mother.
Their expenses should be paid by their father and the father should be able to meet with the children.
When the child becomes of age, he or she can stay with whomever they will.
You rightly mentioned the actual problem is that of the relatives who mislead.
Possessiveness is present in all of our actions.
Because of this, there will be new shareholders in the father's property born, and they will go against him. Otherwise his fathers action is commendable.
These restrictions have caused social evils, even in our marriages.
The concept of the marriage of a divorced woman or a widow has become obscure.
It is these wasteful ideologies and baseless traditions that have made the family structure a mess.
In our society, if the wife of a 50-55 year old man or the husband of such a wife passes away, why are they not looked at in a nice manner?
Near us, there is a Pakistani uncle, whose wife passed away 10-12 years ago. Now, after marrying off all his children, he has married a widow, so even his children have gone against him.
I believe this is his legitimate right. What do you say?
What type of mentality is the "'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place" kind of mentality?
I believe that this person's children should have thought what's wrong if he married a widow after he married off all his children?
This widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
As the children would get busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow, if their wives refuse to look after them when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society we are facing for the last 40-50 years.
A wife can accept her husband going around having illicit relations, but she can't stand him having a second wife.
If possible, stop him from doing so, even after you die.
She destroys her husband and her own hereafter, and becomes a cause for spreading filthiness in society.
Islam doesn't mean anything; In reality, we like only our culture and traditions.
For instance keeping girls from gaining an education and the fear of marrying ones choice.
As for your question about the old man going to the widows house, instead of bringing the widow to his house so the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax, (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt).
In the Indo Pak subcontinent, Islam was accepted centuries ago, but it could not yet leave its ignorant mentality and has always kept culture and tradition above Islam.
Thinking of a man's second marriage as an innovation, divorce as a clinical rest, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife, is all a part of this mentality.
What's more, in mimicry of the western countries, we have started to consider piety and veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam is easy, but leaving this mentality is very tough.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.
Centuries passed with such little writing.
Know that little is much.
Allah Hafiz
Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes, "I found this secret in my life that if the leader of any army is in the front line then that army will never lose."
But that's not the situation here.
They say that common people are there to die for us and they die as martyrs.
But when the common man dies it's murder.
As Salaamu Alaikum wa Rahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu (greeting).
Today, I was returning to my shop after Isha prayers, when a man sitting in a car at the circle raised his hand and diverted my attention towards him.
I thought this man might have lost his way, or he might want to ask something of me, so I stopped, and saw that his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked whether I could understand Arabic well or not. I said, no problem, tell me what you want.
He started to say that, "I have come from Riyadh, to Madinah, but someone has pick-pocketed me, so please help me out." I asked him to excuse me, as such an incident had taken place with me previously; I had given someone 20 Riyals to buy petrol to reach Riyadh, but he went a little ahead and started to ask somebody else.
I got rather upset and began to berate him, and warned him that I would call the military, at which point he got very frightened.
Now the situation has become that we Muslims come in cars with our families to beg all day, and gain at least two or three thousand illegally.
Whereas there is a clear Hadith of the Prophet (SAWS) that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand; the lower hand being the begging hand and the upper hand being the giving one.
May Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims. (Amen, Amen.)

The wife of the famous singer, Adnan Sami, went to a police station in Mumbai. She accused him of torturing her.
The police station advised her to contact a court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Giladari gave a complaint against her husband saying that he continuously tortured her.
He treats her in a non-human manner.
Now it has become difficult for her to bear. This is why she has filed a case against him.
The police, instead of filing a case, told her to contact a court. They said that this matter was not one in which the police could control.
In your opinion, is the accusation of the wife of Adnan Sami proper?
This is not an Indian effort to disgrace Adnan Sami, is it?
Let us know your opinion on this issue.
Adam, Sanghad, Mehr
As far as accusations go, one person can accuse the other.
To get enraged for the sake honor is not sensible. One must show constrain and think of non-violent means if Honor has been compromised.
Whatever be the case between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he had left his everyday life and went to India, hoping to earn more money and better provide for his family. Now that he has become famous.
The event the have unfolded are the results of his own actions.
Washington...
Many nations' ambassadors to America say that President Obama will take a strong stand against Afghan President Hamid Karzai, pushing for him to address corruption in the Afghan government.
In America's new policy for Afghanistan, instead of development and re-building, the war effort has been given more importance.
The envoys say that Hamid Karzai is being considered a barrier in the achievement of the overall American goals in Afghanistan. Corruption in the government is out of control and unchecked. Corrupt government officials have become middlemen and the Taliban are once more gathering strength in many regions of the country.
The American envoys say that officials in the American government are stressing upon Hamid Karzai to do something more concerning the corruption in his government. The main voices being heard are Vice President Joseph Biden and President Obama's representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Hallbrooke.
He said that this good administration was noticed after the President Bush left, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai after every 2 weeks and used to emphasize on the role of America in Afghanistan and the development of its city departments.
Officials say that the Obama administration will work with the state leaders as an extension of the main government.
Officials say that they plan to join Hamid Karzai in the fight against corruption.
Hamid Karzai faces new elections this year, and it is not clear as of yet whether Obama and his companions will favor his presidency or not.
Does this statement of American officials mean a change of relations between America and Afghanistan?
Is the reign of Hamid Karzai coming to an end?
What are your thoughts in this matter?
In a series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka in the first one-day match, although Sri Lanka won in the next two matches.
In the third one-day match, the national team's performance was very poor. They won out in only 75 runs in 23 overs against the 309 runs made by Sri Lanka. The national team should have learned a lesson from this defeat.
The result of the series proves that the National team has no consistency in its performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
Which facets of the game should be addressed most by the authorities?
Are you satisfied with the selections for the team?
Which department would you hold responsible for the defeat- the fielding, batting or bowling department?
Please provide your feedback.
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kinds of heathenish traditions continue to occur. These feudal lords target innocent people using their authority, who would call them Muslims?
A Sardar, himself should walk over these embers. Why doesn't the present government act against them?
When will the judicial justice be of use?
The Shrilanken cricket team has arrived Karachi to play One Day internationals.
Despite tensions between India and Pakistan, it is good to see a foreign team visiting Pakistan once again.
On their arrival at Karachi airport, the Sri Lankan team was given a warm welcome.
There will be two one-day matches in Karachi between Pakistan and Sri Lanka and one in Lahore.
Both sides have made strong claims regarding their bowling, batting and fielding.
While the Sri Lankans are proud of their spinners, Pakistan has its fast bowlers.
The Sri Lankan captain, Mahela Jayawardene, has said that no one player of the Pakistan team can be singled out as a threat, because the whole team is dangerous.
Muralitharan and Mendis are said to be trump cards, and the Pakistani captain has said the competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik said they've already played Muralitharan and now they'll get to face Mendis as well. He added that they have a secret game plan which they'll reveal on the pitch.
Will the contest be as exciting as the Pakistanis and Sri Lankans predict?
Who will gain the upper hand when the series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka actually gets underway?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Give your opinion.
Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.
Malik Yusuf, Dubai.
The Kashmiri people have been fighting for independence for the last 60 years.
No, no one asked, and they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism, so they start talking about making up.
First they openly killed the Muslims, now they are trying to set things right.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating a situation so that the world's attention can be diverted from Kashmir.
Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now the British Government is also understanding that the Indians are taking cover from their corrpution over Kashmir by blaming Pakistan of terrorism.
They hesitate to talk to Pakistan over this issue.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that by resolving the issue of Kashmir it will bring an end to extremism, and the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
It should be clear that the newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister talked to the media in Mumbai and has written an article about the idea of the war against terror is wrong; killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan shouldn't be lenient with the extremist groups.
Due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, India is trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region.
Isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Is India using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialog?

Usman Aftab,
I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
Rather it wants to keep it in check, and hence is thinking of taking certain steps. They know that Pakistan is a nuclear state.
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries are only thinking that if they corner Pakistan, they would face some political and geographic problems. They want to help Pakistan, but also want to be successful in their goal.
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife, and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn Pakistan.
We are ready. The Indian Army chief should keep his mouth shut.

Political statements are coming under the mischievous support of America. America is crazy and now Indians are following the same pattern. If India has the courage to attack, it should to know the reality.
Israel is attacking Hamas and no one has the courage to stop Israel. Following Israel, Indian also wants to have some adventure.
The Prime Minister said that Biden played a great role in shedding Musharraf's uniform and restoring the democracy.
No political party can get the credit of uniform shedding and the restoration of democracy. Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in Parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Dr. Qadir's chapter had closed.
If public protest against dictatorship has no significance to you?.

American President George W Bush, in his last Press conference, advised newly elected President Barack Obama that he made many mistakes in his tenure, and Barack Obama should do what he thinks is right.
I, the President, and according with the constitution of USA and law i did the developments, put forward American interest on my own popularity.

American Vice President Dick Cheney said, "I want to see Osama Bin Laden alive or dead."
He said that Osama Bin Laden is hiding in some hard to reach area and is of no use to his organization, and if Osama Bin Laden is arrested alive or dead then his organization must be destroyed.

Will Dick Cheney's goal to arrest Osama be accomplished?

After the completion of Quaid Azam Trophy match between PIA and Habib Bank, the all-rounder cricketer Shahid Affridi had a altercation with one fan.
When Shahid Affridi came out of the drawing room after playing the match on the UBL ground, a large number of fans gathered around him.
In one instance, a fan held his hand and asked to take a photo with him, after which Shahid Affridi removed his hand from the fan's and said that he can take the photo tomorrow. After further insistence from the fan, Affridi became angry and slapped him. An altercation then began between Affridi and the fan, though the crowd seemed to dismiss the matter there.
Shahid Affridi later said that he had been in a hurry to attend the prayer.
Any way, I beg pardon for this drama.
What do you say about Shahid Afridi's actions?

This is a sad calamity that Israeli is massacring the Palestinians and the same situation is prevalent in Kashmir, but there is no effect on the Security Council.
All the organisations present in Palestine and Kashmir should keep their war going until they gain independence, and they should form unity among themselves and keep facing any type of harm, and one day or the other their martyrdom will give fruit, God Willing.
The air attacks by Israel on Gaza are continuing, just the same. By now, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
Important Hamas leader Nazariyan was killed along with his wife and children.
Here the Security Council meeting concluded without any decision.
The meeting saw American opposition to the derogatory resolutions passed against Israel by Libya and other Arab countries.
Israel's jet planes have been bombarding the residential areas of Palestine for last many days.
Every country around the world began to protest against the Mumbai attacks but can't anyone see this brutality including America and Britain?
Why are the major Muslim countries quiet?
What is your opinion on these double standards of the world?
Saeed, New York.
In my opinion, the basic fact is that most of our people are uneducated and they don't even know where their money is actually going. Government is interested in doing its job properly by applying and collecting taxes. Shortfalls of electricity and gas will continue in the same manner.
Because everyone knows about the character of those who have been elected by our own nation.
Shortages of electricity and gas all over Pakistan has become a critical state.
On the other hand the gas tariff has been raised to 8% whereas in some cities, due to the non-availability of petrol, the difficulties and miseries of the masses are increasing.
Due to the long load shedding of electricity and gas crisis in Pakistan's industrial and business sector, there is a severe reaction. Riots and violent protests are taking place.
Industry leaders gave an ultimatum to stop the mills.
Here, there is still an outlandish situation in the cities: for example, there are blackouts in Karachi from 8 to 10 hours.
The industrial became aproximatly hand less and feet less.
Government leaders are pointing fingers at each other, blaming one another instead of fixing the problems.
Talks with other nation have increase the prices of electric and gas in not a jok.
Why didn't they pay attention and try to solve these problems?
The government is not working to improve the situation.
What are your suggestions to fix these problems?
Please give me your opinion.
After the loss of Imram, that as there are people as there are commonders.
I wonder if those who shout slogans for an administration of the public create a nuisance to the public.
It is torture not to get jelly, petroleum and gas.
Government departments have lost control.
Law and order has been degenerated. May Allah show his mercy  on this country of ours.
A new year has begun.
Last year was a year of political turmoil and chaos. The year will be remembered for terrorism too.
President Musharaf's stepping down from power, the end of President Bush's eight years' reign, the slinging of chappals to Bush, the rethroning of democracy in Pakistan,the unexpected disasters, the earthquake in Baloochistan, the financial melt down all over the world,the depression in the market.
The new year has set in. How do you feel now at the new year's arrival?
In your opinion, What colour will the political and geographical situations in the country take? What tricks will Obama adopt?
Is it possible to predict an end to the threatening terrorism?
Will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?
What turn will the Indo-Pak relations take?
Is there any chance of a surgical strike or a full-fledged war?
What are your expectations for the new year?

Today is the first anniversary of the death of Benazir Bhutto. She was slain after an election rally in Liaqat Bagh, Rawalpindi on 27th December 2007.
Benazir is not among us today. She was a thoughtful politician and a world reknowned figure. She held a special status in national politics.
Although it's been a year now, the enigma of her death remains unsolved.
Her efforts to bring democracy to Pakistan were not in vain.
Today, a democratic government exists in Pakistan, and her husband Asif Zardari currently holds the position of Pakistan's President.
What do you think if the role of martyr Benazir Bhutto is in Pakistani politics?
Who can be her behind murdering?
Recently,, she was given the global human rights award. What would you like to say about her democratic and political services?
After ruling over America for eight years, President Bush left the White House, for presidential camp office, Camp David, so that the White House can be decorated and prepared for new President Barack Obama, according to his wishes.
In Bush's eight year presidency, the historic World Trade Center attack, the attack on the Pentagon, the action against Afghanistan and Iraq in the name of a global war against terrorism, in which armies of many countries were pulled into the war, and American resources were completely exhausted, were some of the memorable events of the Bush era.
As a result of this war, America had to face the worst economic and financial crisis in history.
What do you think the world got and what do you think it lost as a result of this war?
Were the policies of President Bush successful?
What are your views of the Bush era?
The Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from touring Pakistan.
The Indian Cricket Team had to play three tests, five one day matches, and one twenty on the Pakistan Tour.
The Vice-President of the Indian Cricket Board, Rajeev Shukla, who spoke to the news said that the board has asked the government to allow the Pakistan Tour but because of the serious matters between the two countries this tour is not possible.
Is it right to use available political issues of the Indian government as the passport to cancel the cricket tour? Shouldn't the games be kept away from politics?
Isn't the decision of the Indian government towards cricket a loss?
Even though the security in India was poor, the English Cricket Team tour was going on, so why doesn't the Indian team do the Pakistan Tour?
What is your opinion in this regard?
Salman, Karachi.
People who feel proud on going to India.
And their films and videos which are made there, now their eyes must be open to see how much the Indian people respect you.
I remember one interview of Adnan Samee where he said I am not a Pakistani, my popularity is British.
Adnan Sami needs to come to Pakistan at the first opportunity because respect was not accorded him even there.
Fareed Ahmad
Karachi
Indian attitudes have changed after the Mumbai attack.
Jagjit reacted with hate toward Pakistan and Pakistani people.
Adnan Sami sung seven songs of Asha Bhosla, now how can he be out of tune?  Adnan Sami should stay in India: no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam
I will only say this on the statement of Jagjit Singh in Karachi: he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements suitable to situation Pakistanis open your eyes that how much you are given worth in India, understand the thinking of Hindu.
After the Mumbai incident, their hateful statements have increased and they are now spitting poison against popular singer Adnan Sami.
Without my permission at all, a dream takes place in my mind. I must have a house in a beautiful evergreen valley. There must be flowering trees on top of the hill.
Each morning at least one of the flowers that fall from the trees should reach the valley, where my small nest-like house situates.
The second thing was that about our future.
At night, while sleeping on the terrace, I am be able to view the whole star bloomed sky.
Seeing the melting mist in the valley, seeing the gold- bangled hands working in the tiled kitchen, watching my hard work blooming up in the compound.
Looking at the twinkling stars, feeling the softness of fondling fingers, inhaling the fragrance of night jasmine.
What is your opinion about this?
By wearing a mask repeatedly, you have lost your face. You have developed the art of having the brightness of truth even while uttering point blank lies.
I was always dominated by an uncontrollable thirst for affection.
When my problem is something concerned with money.
There are many problems faced by people in the world that are not under the control of human beings.
I feel the main cause is people not thinking clearly.
The consequence of not thinking clearly is having to face very dangerous problems that arise in the future.
Today itself start for the well beings of the people
What do people seriously think about that?
Poverty, financial crisis, and diseases are the main challenges that people going to face in the future.
What did the people think about the dangerous calamities that have affected many people?
Are you ready to start today?
We should firmly make a decision today about how to solve the problems. It is not going to be easy or without risk.  First of all we have to have a good mind and attitude towards our goal.
The world faced many calamities such as earthquakes, floods, and tsunamis.  However we have not learned yet to take precautionary measures beforehand. We only act after the calamities. Our scientists to find necessary steps to help us prepare before such devastation occurs.

But than she totally changed.
Is it also true that he neglected senior members of his party and chose his son as a party leader? What kind of  Democracy is this?
Jimmy Noor, Karachi, this news proved that the Quran said that Non-believers will support only Non-Believers.
An axe cant cut wood unless it has a wooden handle.
Our leaders are responsible for the hardships and problems our country is in.
May God bless our leaders with righteousness.

Are there not any terrorist groups in India?
Are International groups not aware of the tortures being done to the minorities in India?
