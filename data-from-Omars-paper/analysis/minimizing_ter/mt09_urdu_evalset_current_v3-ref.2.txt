While declaring the Israeli attack on Palestinians a crime against humanity, he said that all countries should deplore these attacks.
Mushahid Hussain, while criticizing the double standards of the countries of the world, asked why those who talk against terrorism are silent about the Israeli attacks on Palestinians.
The Chairman of the Senate's Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs also criticized the cold attitude of the leaders of the Muslim world on the issue of Palestine.

Avoid Dieting to Avoid Flu
This research of American scientists has come to light after experiments done on mice.
The experiments have proved that the capability of fighting Flu virus became less in mice placed on food containing fewer calories.
The old saying that,'It's better to starve during fever,'has been proven wrong by the research.
According to the scientists,eat well during fever.
According to the researchers of Michigan State University, the fighting capability against infections in mice that were placed on a diet was found meagre and the chances of their death increased, while the mice placed on regular food had a very high immunity against flu virus.
According to Professor Elizabeth Gardner, people on a diet will not only be affected very quickly by the flu,it will also take more time for them to recuperate.
She also says that even those people who have taken the flu vaccine should avoid dieting during the few months of winter.
"First Nuclear Experiment conducted in 1990"
Thomas Reed, who has worked as a weapon designer in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory of America, has written this book in collaboration with Danny Stillman,the former Director of Technical Intelligence of Los Alamos National Laboratory.
This book has been written with the title 'Nuclear Express:A Political History of the Bomb And its Proliferation,' and in this both the authors have claimed that any country that has made an atomic bomb has either stolen the nuclear secrets of another country or has had cooperation with some other nuclear power.
Thomas Reed said in an interview to US News that in 1990, in the era of Benazir Bhutto, China had conducted the experiment of Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Thomas Reed said that he is convinced on the basis of several reasons that China has conducted the experiment of Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Those reasons include the design of the bomb and information obtained while talking to the scientists of China.
He further said that this was the reason why in 1998, Pakistan was able to conduct a nuclear experiment just in two weeks and three days in response to India's nuclear experiment.
Thomas Reed also reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and it took 17 days for America to do the experiment in response to this, although America already had this bomb for awhile.
He further said that the atom bomb, whose experiment was done in 1998 by Pakistan, was developed with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had full confidence in it.
When Thomas Reed was asked if China had provided the nuclear technology to Pakistan, he replied that India was a common enemy of China and Pakistan.
He said that the proof to this also exists in that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and, apart from this, the documents retrieved from Libya afterwards also proved this.
To another question as to whether it is usual to carry out nuclear experiments with others, he said that in 1990 America openly conducted a nuclear experiment for Britain in the desert of Nevada.
He said that we may also presume that Israel, too, was given access to the results of this experiment.
Thomas Reed was also asked whether China's nuclear proliferation program is active.
On this, Thomas Reid said that since 1991, China has been providing raw material, instructions, and designs for the nuclear structure situated in Ispahan, a city in Iran.
Besides this, China has also provided an enrichment plant to Iran in Karaj.
He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen through North Korea.

Some Sindhi newspapers published the translation of Bakhtawar's poetry; however, her voice is being heard for the first time on YouTube.
Some workers and admirers of Benazir Bhutto have started making CDs of Bakhtawar's rap songs.
On the other hand, the spokesman of Pakistan Peoples Party, Farhatullah Babar, has confirmed that the poetry and voice in the song present on YouTube are that of Bakhtawar.
He said from Islamabad over the telephone that this is a tribute from an aggrieved daughter to her courageous mother that has also been aired on the government TV network in Pakistan.
Farhatullah Babar said that at this time his party has no program of distributing the CDs, etc. of Bakhtawar's songs.
He said that a few months ago a fake account of the young Chairman of his party, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, was created on Facebook, which was eliminated later on.

Protest against the Sacking of Journalists
On Tuesday in front of Islamabad Press Club, journalists and newspaper workers rallied and raised slogans in a protest organized by the organization of the journalists of Islamabad 'RIUJ' against media owners and the government on the sacking of a large number of employees from TV channels and newspapers.
Addressing the demonstrators, the senior member of the largest organization of the journalists, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, C. R. Shamsi, said that those politicians who were protesting with us on the streets lately, have now become rulers and are sitting in the parliament; however, they are not doing any good for the rights of journalists, as they are afraid of a specific group of newspaper owners.
He said that the newspaper owners, who talk about human rights, have turned their organizations into torture cells and labor camps, where, despite making billions of rupees, they are committing financial murder on workers by paying them extremely low wages and sacking them from the employment.
In front of us, the example of this is that of a worker of a private TV channel FIVE who committed suicide after not getting the salary for four months, and even today, many workers are living miserably because of forced dismissals and not getting salaries for months.
He said that direct action should be taken against TV and newspaper owners, and for the rights of journalists, a protest camp is needed on a permanent basis in front of the parliament.
Criticizing the Governor of the Punjab Salman Taseer, C. R. Shamsi said that the employees are being sacked without any notice from his Urdu newspaper 'Aaj Kal',
whereas Daily Jinnah, Daily Khabrain, Channel Five, Business Plus TV, and Aaj TV have also dismissed dozens of employees.
Addressing the protestors, the Secretary General of PUFJ, Mazhar Abbas, said that today the journalist organizations are observing Black Day countrywide against the sacking of journalists and newspaper workers, whereas the journalist will go to the session of the parliament with black bands on their arms for the achievement of their rights.
According to Mazhar Abbas, in 85% of the newspapers and TV channels, workers and journalists are being exploited where they are working without any contract.
He said that as of now, more than 200 journalists and workers are being dismissed from the newspapers and TV channels, and it is feared that in the current year, the owners will dismiss hundreds of workers on the justification of financial crisis.
Mazhar Abbas said that the journalists movement will continue until the dismissed workers are reinstated, the 7th Wage Board Award, which assesses the wages of newspaper workers, is implemented, and TV channels and newspaper workers are paid their unpaid salaries for many months.

British Hacker Wins in Court
A 42 year-old British citizen has confessed that he had hacked into a Web site of the American Military.
Gary is a patient of Asperger's Syndrome. It should be noted that the patient of Asperger's Syndrome has an obsession of doing the same type of work.
His attorneys say that if he is handed over to America, then it is feared that he would try to make a suicide attempt.
Nonetheless, the government attorneys are saying that the concerns about Gary's health are meager.
While giving the verdict, Lord Justice Maurice Kay and Mr. Justice Simon said that Gary is permitted to file a review petition in the British Court.
Gary's attorneys took the plea in the court that if Gary was separated from his home and family, he might commit suicide.
They further said that the Home Secretary did not consider this aspect.
But the government attorneys say that the Home Secretary used his discretionary powers.
Gary has never denied hacking into the American Military Web site.
Gary hacked into an American computer system in 2001 and 2002, as a result of which the American Government incurred a loss of eight-hundred thousand dollars.
Gary has hacked into 97 computers, including the American Navy and NASA system.
Nonetheless, Gary says that he did not hack with any ulterior motives; he was rather searching for information about celestial beings which, in his mind, the American Government had kept secret.

Kashmir: Two Hizb Commanders Killed
Spokesman of the North Command of the Indian Army, deployed in Jammu, Lieutenant Colonel Acharya told BBC: 'The 24 Rashtriya Rifles and Jammu Kashmir Police, after getting the verified information, besieged the place in Batti Haas forest in Tehseel Gandoh of District Dodah where the armed extremists were hiding".
They opened fire on the Army and in the counter operation, two armed extremists were killed.
According to the spokesman, those who were killed included the Tehsil Commander of the defunct Hizbul Mujahideen, active for 12 years in the district, Zahooruddin Khande, who was an expert in gun-powder explosions.
His accomplice has been identified as Sajjad Hussain, who, according to the army, got associated with extremists last year.
According to Acharya, the operation is still going on in the said forest area of Minkorah, because, according to him, the presence of more extremists is expected there. According to the army, in the first phase of the operation, two Kalashnikovs have also been recovered.
While releasing the statistics of the year 2008 the previous day, the Head of the Provincial Police Kuldeep Kumar Khuda declared this year the most peaceful year till now.
It is worth mentioning that there was no violence perpetrated, even in Assembly elections held in November and December in 7 phases.
More than 1350 candidates participated in these elections.
Be it known that Hizbul Mujahideen has been active in Jammu Kashmir for the last 18 years.
Hizb announced unilateral ceasefire for the first time in July 2000, after which talks were held between the Indian Government and the commanders of Hizb.
However, the ceasefire ended in just 15 days.
After this, several high-level commanders of Hizbul Mujahideen were killed in different operations.
On Thursday Pakistan's famous daily newspaper 'The News' wrote about extremists present in Pakistan- administered Kashmir that Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Hizbul Mujahideen have decided to review its Kashmir Policy.
Let it be evident that till now both organizations had the policy that the Kashmir issue could be resolved only with armed resistance.

Administrator Appointed for Jamaat-ud-Dawa
The Headquarters of Jamaat-ud-Dawa is located in Mureed Ke, around 25 kilometers away from Lahore.
This center has a hospital, a school and hostels for the students.
According to the Law Minister of Punjab Rana Sanaullah Khan, the administrator has been appointed in the center of Jamaat-ud-Dawa so that the working of the welfare institutions present there should not be affected.
According to Khalid Waleed, the son-in-law of the Chief of Jamaat-ud-Dawa Hafiz Saeed, a high-level government officer Khaqan Baber has been appointed as administrator for the supervision of the hospital, school and other welfare institutions in the center ; whereas, according to him, the police force deployed in the center has also been beefed up.
The Security Council of the United Nations has imposed restrictions on Jamaat-ud-Dawa, after which the federal government of Pakistan launched a countrywide operation against Jamaat-ud-Dawa and the leaders, including the chief of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, Hafiz Saeed, have been placed under house arrest. The appointment of administrator in Taiba Center by the Government of Punjab is also a continuation of the operation against Jamaat-ud-Dawa by the Federal Government.
Khaqan Babar belongs to DMG, meaning District Management Group.
Hafiz Khalid Waleed said that Lahore Division Commissioner, Khusro Pervaiz Khan came to Taiba Center on Sunday with the police and civil administration and inspected different sections of the center. Khalid Waleed has condemned the appointment of the administrator in Jamaat-ud-Dawa's center from the government and said that due to the government operation, the number of patients in the hospital situated in the center and the students in the school has already declined.

It has been said in the letter that the unilateral decision of putting restriction on Jamaat-ud-Dawa by the Security Council is unjust and Jamaat-ud-Dawa has no connection with terrorism, whereas it is involved in welfare activities.
Edhi on Relief Mission to Gaza
After going through different steps in the process of getting permission to enter Gaza, he has succeeded only in reaching Egypt from New York as of now.
Talking to BBC Urdu Service from Cairo, he said he has not reached Gaza yet, because Egypt and Israel have set up so many obstacles.
He said that he is there for eight days and still he has not received permission to go to Gaza.
"I am in Cairo at this time and hopefully will get the permission to go to Gaza by tomorrow."
Telling the details, he said: "In the beginning I was given the visa to go to Gaza only for 7 days, after which on my insistence, the Pakistani officials helped me and got it extended to one month, but only on the condition that I would go to Gaza only once, meaning Single Entry.
he said he has his sons and daughters with him and they want to carry out relief assistance in Gaza.
I have brought some money'
I have given a check of one-hundred thousand dollars to the Red Cross of Egypt and also ten-thousand dollars in cash, so that they could send relief goods to Gaza.
Four More Ministers in The Cabinet, Totaling 63
Of the four new federal ministers, two are from the Muttahida Qaumi Movement and two are members of the Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Islam Fazl-ur-Rehman group.
President Asif Ali Zardari took the oath from new ministers.
At the oath taking ceremony Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and members of the federal cabinet were also present.
With the induction of four new ministers in the federal cabinet, the number of Federal Ministers, Ministers of State and Advisors totals 63.
The two ministers of MQM are Farooq Sattar and Babar Ghauri, whereas from Jamiat-e-Ulema-e-Islam Fazl-ur-Rehman group, Azam Swati and Maulana Ataur Rahman are included.
As of now, the portfolios of these ministers have not been announced.
Farooq Sattar is the convener of MQM, while Babar Ghauri is a Senator of MQM whose tenure is ending on March 10.
Azam Swati was elected Senator as an independent, and he is reckoned to be one of the wealthiest Senators.
Maulana Ataur Rahman is a Member of the National Assembly and is the younger brother of Maulana Fazl-ur-Rahman.
This should be kept in mind that four advisors holding important posts are not members of the National Assembly.
It should remain clear that when on November 03, 2008, 22 new ministers and 18 state ministers were included, it was thought that MQM's members would also be included in the cabinet; however, due to the differences in the distribution of the ministries, MQM did not join.
Balochistan, Pipeline Blown
According to the police, this is an 18-inch diameter pipeline which, from different wells in Pir Koh, goes to the gas plant in Sui, and it was blown up early morning with explosion.
Besides this, the previous day, well number 3 in Sui was completely destroyed with explosion and a gas pipeline close to Dera Allah Yar has been damaged with explosion.
The responsibility of these explosions has been accepted by Sarbaz Baloch, spokesman of the Baloch Republican Army, on behalf of his organization.
With the very inception of the year 2009, the incidents of terrorism have increased in Baluchistan.
This month, dozens of gas pipelines have so far been blown up with explosions, whereas the attacks on trains and people belonging to Punjab province have increased.
Although the Chief Minister of Balochistan Nawab Aslam Raeesani has shown concern on these incidents and has ordered the police to exchange information with the intelligence agencies. Curbing these types of incidents has not been possible yet.
819 Billion-Dollar Economic recovery Package Approved
None of the members belonging to the Republican Party voted in favor of this plan of President Obama.
The Republican members were of the view that this economic plan was very 'expensive' and would not prove effective.
244 votes in favor and 188 votes against this package were cast in the House of Representatives.
This plan of economic recovery is going to be presented to the Senate next week, where the ruling Democratic Party has an extremely slim majority.
It is feared that due to the severe opposition from the Republican Party, its approval would not be easy from the Senate.
After the approval of the economic recovery plan in the House of Representatives,Barack Obama insisted to the members that they should not allow political differences to become a barrier to this important plan.
The President said that this plan, which he expects to be transformed into a bill by next month, would prove to be helpful in making the environment favorable in the country in which American trade will flourish.
Through this plan, 276 billion dollars will be given for the relief in the loans for common men and the business community, while 540 billion will be given for roads, bridges, the renovation of 10,000 schools, unemployment allowance, and research in new technology.
BBC correspondent Richard Lester said in Washington that Barack Obama had a determination of introducing a new political culture by burying political differences, but the arguments on this economic package have once again created tension on a political basis.
The members of the Republican Party in the House of Representatives have declared this bill, proposed by the government, a waste of government money and said that this would not help in creating any new opportunities for employment.
They insisted on the bill proposed by their party, in which there is more emphasis on tax relief.
They said that through their package, more employment opportunities could be created with far less investment.
They said that, compared to developmental projects, more employment opportunities could be created instantly with the relief in the taxes.
Tension Between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Rajab Tayyab Argan said to the Israeli President, almost yelling, that blood has been shed of many people in Gaza and he felt sorry to see that people could even applaud the military action from Israel.
Mr. Argan said: "It looks to me that probably you are using these words to reduce your sense of guilt and that, too, on a high note, but you have killed people and I am remembering those children who were killed near the coastline.
Shimon Peres said that the tragedy of Gaza was not inflicted by Israel, but it was due to Hamas, which has established a dangerous dictatorship over there.
BBC correspondent says from Davos that such type of scene has never been seen before in an international economic forum.
However, Argan said afterwards that he respected the Israeli president and also his elderliness, due to which he did not yell at him, but whatever he was saying was far from the truth.
Turkey is one of the few Muslim countries which has diplomatic relations with Israel, but a tension has existed in these relations for the last few years.
"Attacks Not Planned in Pakistan"
Talking to the Indian channel 'NDTV' Wajid Shams-ul-Hasan said that the report on Pakistani investigations on the Mumbai attacks would be released soon.
Last November in the attacks on Mumbai, more that 170 people were killed.
India says that the extremist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba is responsible for the attacks.
India also said that Pakistan's 'state elements' were involved in the Mumbai attacks.
Relations of both countries have been affected after the Mumbai attacks.
The High Commissioner Wajid Shams-ul-Hasan has given the first-ever statement about Pakistani investigations which gives a clue what could be in the investigation report.
Wajid Shams-ul-Hasan said: "Pakistani territory has not been used according to the conclusions reached by the investigators so far."
This may be some other place, not even Britain.
These were the two places (Pakistan and Britain), I was concerned about.
India and the international community have put enough pressure on Pakistan to take action against those who are responsible for the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan says that it has arrested dozens of people in the action against groups allegedly involved in the Mumbai attacks.
Wajid Shams-ul-Hasan said: "We are not trying to cover it.
We believe in acting on the facts.
Our investigations will be acceptable to the world.
We will try to satisfy India with the results (of investigations).
He said, while defending the delay in the Pakistani investigations, that it takes time to collect, understand and test this type of material.
High Commissioner Wajid Shams-ul-Hasan said it took 45 days for India to present their dossier.
Republicans also Elect a Black as their Leader
In the sixth phase of the elections in the Republican Party, Michael Steele, who got 91 votes out of 168 votes, won.
In the election for the post of the Party Chairman, the opponent of Steele, Katon Dawson, got 77 votes, while the former chairman Duncan withdrew from the contest in the second phase.
The correspondents say that out of those five candidates who were contesting for the chairmanship of the Republican Party, Michael Steele is accepted as the most moderate leader.
After the victory, Michael Steele said in his address, "we are going to ask our friends and foes together to come with us, but those who would try to put obstacles in it, should get ready to stay away from us." Michael Steele belongs to Maryland, where he had also been the Lieutenant Governor.
He became famous in 2006, when he contested in elections for a seat of the Senate.
However, after losing in the elections, he was appointed chairman of the Political Conservative Committee of the party.
Now, after being elected as Chairman of the party, the countrywide campaign endeavors of the party will be under his supervision.
He has contested in the election with a promise that he will give a new direction to the party and will use a new strategy to keep the pro-fundamentalists united with the party.
Indians Claim Presence of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad in Jammu
Information is available regarding the presence of terrorists in District Poonch of Jammu.
According to official sources, after getting the confidential information, the Army and Police cordoned off the area and began a search.
In the meantime, a scuffle started in which four terrorists, two soldiers and one police official were killed.
According to the sources, until the last information received, skirmish was going on and the terrorists belonging to Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad were present in that area and more soldiers have been sent there to combat them.
Meanwhile, Omar Abdullah, Chief Minister appointed by the coalition government, met with the Governor and informed him of his appointment as the leader of the Assembly on behalf of his party the National Conference.
Congress, the ally of the National Conference, also informed the Governor of their support for Omar Abdullah.
Omar Abdullah will be sworn in tomorrow as the Chief Minister of the state.
It should be remembered that in the current state elections, the National Conference has emerged as the largest party after getting 28 seats in the Assembly of 87 members. It should remain clear that separatist parties have boycotted the elections.
Congress, which has 17 seats, has agreed to form a coalition government with the National Conference.
The party workers gave a warm welcome to Omar Abdullah today on his arrival to Srinagar.
On this occasion, Omar Abdullah said that he would play his role in making the talks possible between separatists and the Indian government; however, it would not be possible until the elections are held in India and the new government comes into power.
European Union's Role in Middle East Peace
If seen from the official perspective, the European Union's role in reconciliation efforts to stop the Middle East war is decisive.
According to the Brussels government stand, efforts of the Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy's are synonymous to help in this task.
The spokesman of the European Commission Amadeu Altafaj said that all such efforts through which sending a joint message to the warring parties from the European Union could be helpful, are worthy of praise.
Everything looks fine from the perspective of the official statement.
But, in reality, the European Union is presenting a regretful picture of the internal tug of war.
The role of the Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak.
On top of this, the internal wrangling has made it helpless.
On the other hand, the French President Sarkozy is acting like he is still discharging the duties as the president of the European Union.
Although France has already completed its six-month presidential tenure.
Sarkozy wants to play the lead role and he can do it; but he is not permitted for this.
The most embarrassing situation is being faced by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner.
He is in the delegation which is headed by the Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic, Schwarzenberg.
And on top of this, both foreign ministers are giving different statements about the Middle East war.
Kouchner says that Israel has a right of self-defense, while according to Schwarzenberg, this war does not come under self defense. In the meantime, Germany has also sent its special envoy to the Middle East. Until the European Union shows harmony based on similar point of views, it cannot succeed on the diplomatic front.
The proof of this is the attitude of Israel, which does not give any importance to the reconciliation efforts of Europe.
This is the golden opportunity for the European Union to accomplish something, as America has already failed in the Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.
Economic Crisis: Billionaire German Industrialist Commits Suicide
Although Adolf Merckle, a resident of the area of Swabia of South Germany, has left a huge business group after him.
But the common German citizens did not know much about him up until a little while ago.
Then, when he had to negotiate with about 30 banks for many weeks which provided loans to his business group, he became the subject of the headlines, and the future of Merckle Group also looked to bleak him.
Merckle Group also had to bear a loss of hundreds of millions of Euros due to the financial crisis after buying shares of German car manufacturing company Volkswagen.
And when the financial institutions denied the new loans, valued at between 700 million and one-billion Euros, mandatorily needed by this group, Merckle came under severe stress.
Sometime back, these very banks had agreed to provide loans to Merckle Group on an emergency basis; however, Adolf Merckle, who had risen to such heights from a small industrialist that his group's income had become around 30 billion Euros, could not bear the loss of his investment power.
When Adolf Merckle took charge of his family business after the death of his father, he managed it on the modern lines and gave it a tremendous boost.
He named his company Ratiopharm, which is an extremely successful and very large pharmaceutical firm of Germany today.
Until sometime ago, the business worth of this pharmaceutical firm was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and even now it earns 1.8 billion Euros annually. After the huge success of Ratiopharm, Merckle Group purchased many large firms, which included a company named Heidelberg Cement manufacturing construction materials to the company named Kaessbohrer, which manufactures a special type of vehicles.
The number of the employees of Merckle Group around the globe is one-hundred thousand and in its assets, Ratiopharm, the drug manufacturing company, has always held special importance.
Adolf Merckle had said this many times in his life: "We have been manufacturing drugs for four generations.
Now the management of this firm is in the hands of my children and I hope that this firm will still remain under my family's management for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merckle, banks have approved interim loans worth 400 million Euros for his group VEM, but on the condition that VEM has to sell Ratiopharm so that the financial condition of this group could be improved on a long-term basis.
This way, after the death of Adolf Merckle, the Merckle Group would not remain the same like it used to be.
Crime Rate among Foreigners in Germany
According to the latest statistics, the crime rate among foreigners between 2004 and 2007
has reduced from 22.9 percent
to 21.4 percent.
According to Joachim Herrmann, the Interior Minister of Bavaria Province, this is apparently a mere positive change.
He said: "It should be kept in mind that the number of foreigners seeking German nationality is increasing."
Therefore, this fact should also be mentioned in the statistics that although the person who commits a crime is a German, he/she also has a foreign background.
Herrmann said that from 2010, his province will keep this fact in mind while collecting statistics about criminals.
Besides Bavaria, the province of Hamburg is also thinking on the same lines.
Senator for Interior Affairs Christoph Ahlhaus of CDU said: "When investigations are done according to the scientific method, a person cannot compile results beforehand as per his/her own will, instead the results depend on the statistics which come after the investigations have been completed."
Ahlhaus drew attention to an analytical report of a provincial crime control office, which was prepared in 2006, and according to which it was investigated that in Bergdorf, a part of the city of Hamburg, what percentage of the foreigners is involved in the crimes taking place there.
The results have shown that here foreigners'
rate of crime is lower as compared to the crimes taking place in the whole province.
Contrary to this, when in Berlin, in 2006 the rate of crime in youngsters was reviewed, it was found that the percentage of youngsters having foreign background was 44
.7 percent.
However, the other political parties of Germany, for example Linkspartei, the party of environmentalists, Greens and the leftist party, SPD, are against this proposal that, while collecting statistics related to crimes, this information should also be collected in which German citizens have a foreign background.
We Want Army Evacuation From Gaza Soon: Olmert
Ehud Olmert insisted that a permanent and stable ceasefire agreement is indispensible for complete evacuation of the army.
Hamas and Israel announced a ceasefire on Sunday.
While declaring a ceasefire for one week, the Islamic militant organization Hamas said that the Israeli army should evacuate completely from the Gaza Strip within a week and that a blockade of the Gaza Strip should be removed.
On the other hand, the leader of Hamas Ismael Hania said that God has given victory to Israel in the Gaza war.
He said that in the Gaza war, Israel failed to achieve its goals.
Prior to this, on Sunday in the city of Egypt, Sharm ash Shaykh, a meeting of the leaders of Europe and Arab countries was held, in which Israel was demanded for immediate evacuation of its army from Gaza.
It was decided in the meeting that soon an international relief conference would be convened for Gaza.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel also attended the said meeting.
In the war, lasting for three weeks, between the warriors of Israel and Hamas, at least 1300 Palestinians and 13 Israelis, including 10 soldiers, were killed.
On the other hand, the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas has insisted on forming a united national government in Palestinian areas.
Al Qaeda's Video Message for Germany
In this video of 30 minutes' duration, one person, wearing a black turban, mask on the face and holding a gun in his hand is giving a message to the German government.
This person is introducing himself with the name Abu Talha and is conversing in German language.
This video message also has Arabic subtitles.
Al Qaeda's logo appears on the side of the screen and the video has the date of October 2008.
In this message, this has been conveyed to the German government that if they were exhibiting confidence that they would not be attacked due to deployment of such a huge army in Afghanistan, they are sadly mistaken and ignorant.
This person, calling himself Abu Talha, has however, not given a threat to Germany of direct attacks.
The number of German soldiers in the NATO coalition army, deployed at this time in Afghanistan, is around three-thousand, five-hundred.
Last year in October, the German parliament approved a bill sending 1000 more soldiers to Afghanistan.
This is the first message from Al Qaeda to Germany.
Prominent expert having insight in affairs pertaining to terrorism, Michael Luders says with reference to this message: " The recent suicidal attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul is a testimony that we should take it seriously under any circumstance.
For the last few years, Al Qaeda has been issuing video messages on the Internet, and there have also been attacks after such messages.
The militant organization the Taliban has taken responsibility of the suicidal attack that occurred on Saturday outside the German Embassy in Kabul.
Most of the German newspapers and observers are looking at this attack together with Al Qaeda's message.
"They are targeting Germany
The fundamentalist Muslims see Germany's Afghan policy with critical eyes and as negative.
They blame the German government for adopting discriminatory policies not only in Afghanistan, but also in the Middle East.
And because of this reason, they are taking Germany more and more as their target.
In the meantime, the German Government says that the German intelligence agency already knew about this video, even before it became public.
A German federal crimes control agency is busy examining this video.
Obama has taken Charge of the American Presidency
In this perspective, not only the American public, but the whole world has reposed different expectations in Obama.
Now when Obama is getting felicitation messages from the whole world on becoming the President of America, the expectations associated with him are also coming forth.
With this reference, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has shown confidence in the new American President.
"I am sure that on the basis of profound friendship and cooperation between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America, we can solve the challenges faced.
The Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says that Obama looks like a sober and open-hearted person and this is definitely a good sign.
Although the policies of the former American President George W. Bush have always been criticized,
nonetheless, his administration is definitely praised for encouraging China to play a more constructive role at the international level, whereas China has said about the new American president that he has to work for a strong military relationship between the two countries.
An active Chinese political expert in the German city Bochum, Goo Sui Woo, says
"In this perspective, I am sure that in the coming weeks and months, Obama and his financial team will exert extreme pressure to force the Beijing government to adopt a flexible and market-compatible exchange rate for the Chinese currency.
The former American administration has also furthered its relationship with India.
Where Obama can take this relationship to, the Professor of American Studies in New Delhi Prof Christopher Raj says about it: "We have come very close in the strategic partnership; however, Obama cannot bring any change overnight.
Pope Benedict has also insisted, in his message to Obama, for the promotion of an atmosphere of peace and cooperation in the world.
Provincial Elections in Iraq
After 2005, these are the first important elections in this war-stricken country.
More than 14,400 candidates are contesting for 440 seats in the provincial elections.
Eight-hundred thousand policemen and military personnel have been deployed in Iraq to maintain the law and order situation.
With the apprehension of any explosion or any other terrorist attack on such an important day, all borders of Iraq had been sealed a day earlier, that is on Friday.
Besides this, airports have been closed and public transport has been banned.
According to the information, no traffic is seen on the roads of Baghdad due to the ban on public transport, and Iraqi children are seen playing football on the roads.
With the security situation during the current Iraqi elections, on one hand, this would be conjectured whether or not the local security agencies will be able to take charge of the country after the return of American troops in 2011; and on the other hand, political analysts are taking it as an experiment from which it would be determined to what extent the Iraqi people are ready to bring change in the country on democratic grounds.
Provincial elections are being held in Iraq with the help of the United Nations, and around eight-hundred international observers are reviewing the election process.

Gaza: Retreat of Israeli Forces from the Ajlain Area // Unparalleled Endurance of Palestinian mujahideen.
According to the Urdu service of the news agency Mehr, even on the 16th day of the battle of Good and Evil in Gaza, Israel continued its barbaric bombing on the civilian population, in Israel's air, field, and naval attacks on Gaza, as of now 880 people have been martyred and 3700 Palestinians have been wounded.
Among the martyrs are also included 275 innocent children, who have embraced death, smiling at the treacherous attitude of Arab leaders, and the so-called international human rights organizations.
Today, in the Ajlain area, the shroud-bearer mujahideen compelled the Israeli forces to retreat and are showing magnificent rectitude and steadfastness with the power of faith and martyrdom and are narrowing in the life on the Jewish enemies.
If the Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had not been a traitor, the proud and brave mujahideen of Hamas would have defeated Israel long ago, but, along with the Israeli siege, Egypt has also besieged Palestinian Muslims, which is the most sorrowful episode in Arab history.
Meanwhile, the governments of Saudi Arabia and Jordan are also providing political and financial support to Israel and taking the side of Israel while deceiving unarmed Muslims of Gaza.
America to Adopt New Strategy for Iran: Barack Obama
According to the news agency Mehr, the elected President of America Barack Obama said while talking to the ABC news channel that America will adopt a new and advanced strategy on the Iran issue.
Barack Obama said: "Iran will be a very big challenge for the American Government."
Barack Obama said that he has concerns over Iran's support to Palestinian organization Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran's nuclear enrichment program.
But he will not continue the policy of the present American president Bush about Iran and will adopt a different policy in connection with the relations with Iran.
Barack Obama said that he will insist on his wish for mutual respect and talks while making the main objective clear.
Barack Obama has said in the past, too, that in connection with the talks with Iran, no preconditions should be imposed.
During the interview, he expressed the hope that his administration would promptly follow this new strategy relating to Iran.
About the Middle East crisis, Obama said that he is going to form a special team in this connection
which will start working after January 20 for the efforts of making peace in the Middle East.
President George Bush; American Incompetent and Hated President Bush Accepts Mistakes and Crimes in his Last Press Address
The news agency Mehr has quoted with reference to the Associated Press that American President George Bush has accepted, in the last press conference of his tenure, his several mistakes and crimes.
Addressing a press conference in the White House, President Bush said that he has good feelings about the newly-elected President Obama; however, the biggest challenge for Obama will be that he stops possible attacks on America.
He said that accomplishment of the mission in Iraq and social security reforms were his mistakes.
President Bush said that whatever he did, he did so for the safety of America.
Responding to many questions asked about the continued Israeli aggression in Gaza, President Bush said that Israel has the right of its defense. According to him, Hamas does not have the right to defend, and Hamas should not raise hands on Israel, and the whole world, like America, should strangulate the oppressed instead of the oppressor.
The unworthy, incompetent, and hated president of America said that Hamas should not be provided with any weapons, whereas America is providing the most lethal and destructive weapons in the world to Israel, and Israel is making use of the American weapons in the massacre of Palestinians. Bush also praised pro-Israel Arabs and declared them as friends of Israel.
Bush also showed his sense of embarrassment on a number of crimes occurring in Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay.
Observers say that a war crime case should be filed against Bush and those organizations accomplishing this task will be doing a great act of kindness on humanity.

The report of the news agency Mehr says that President of Iran Doctor Ahmadinejad has expressed sorrow while strongly criticizing the silence of the Arab leaders on the Israeli aggression and its brutalities in Gaza.
President Ahmadinejad said, while expressing his astonishment over the silence of the Arab countries and their heads on the barbaric operation of Israel in Gaza, that Israel is engaging in a holocaust of the Palestinians and making Palestinian children, women, and common citizens a target of its barbarism, and the Arab leaders have not issued even a single statement.
President Ahmadinejad said that all Arab countries should unite against Israel and save the oppressed Muslims of Gaza from the evil and brutalities of Israel.
The King of Saudi Arabia should Clarify his Viewpoint on Human Genocide by Israel in Gaza: Ahmadinejad
According to the report of the news agency Mehr, President Ahmedinajad has said in a message to the ruler of Saudi Arabia, Malik Abdullah, that the silence of the Muslim King of Saudi Arabia over human genocide in Gaza and the silence over the massacre of innocent children and women in Gaza has become a cause of encouragement to the enemies of Islam.
President Ahmadinejad has said in his message that you should clarify your correct point of views about Gaza by supporting the oppressed so that the efforts at creating differences in the Islamic Front by enemies may fail.
President Ahmadinejad has said in his message that you know that Israel has been carrying out human genocide in Gaza for the last 19 days, killing innocent children, bombing houses, mosques, schools, and hospitals insensibly, and the Jewish government is massacring innocent Muslims badly in Gaza. In this situation, the silence of leaders like you has emboldened the Israelis, making their morale high.
President Ahmadinejad said to Malik Abdullah that when non-Muslim countries like Venezuela and Bolivia have taken solid steps against Israel, then better steps compared to the steps taken by those countries are expected from you.
President Ahmadinejad said that the Palestinians will be victorious in Gaza.
And the oppressed will prevail over the oppressor and this is God's promise.
Terrorism Still Poses Danger to America: President George Bush
The news agency Mehr has quoted with reference to German news agency that American President George Bush has said, while addressing to his successor Barack Obama and the nation in his farewell address, that although America is safe today as compared to 7 years ago, the danger of terrorism is still dangling on America's head.
Bush said that the terrorist enemy is sitting patiently for an ambush and they are determined to attack America and America should not remain oblivious of its security.
The American president defended his aggressive and wrong policies while putting aside the grief and misery of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. The American president said that America is still the biggest country supporting freedom; however, the observers don't accept that these statements of the hated American president are true, because America is neither a flag-bearer of freedom nor is it a supporter of human rights. Instead, America is the most mischievous country in the world, supporting not only a predator government like that of Israel, but also directly participating in these crimes.
Israel is carrying out the massacres of children, women, and common citizens, and the American President is applauding her; the world is watching this American humanity and freedom in Gaza and other places of the world.
War Will Continue in Palestine: Osama Hamdan
According to the news agency Mehr, Hamas representative in Lebanon, Osama Hamdan has said, while talking to a French news agency, that a one-sided ceasefire by Israel is against the international efforts for a comprehensive ceasefire. He said that as long as Israel remains in Gaza, a one-sided ceasefire will remain meaningless.
He said that the one-sided ceasefire is Israel's effort in vain to avoid the defeat. Hamadan said that if Israel wants a durable peace it has to end the siege as well as accept the conditions of Hamas.
The Hamas leader in Lebanon made clear that, with the presence of the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip, if Israel ended the one-sided ceasefire, resistance would continue against it.
Addressing a conference for solidarity with Gaza people in Beirut, Osama Hamdan demanded of the European countries to sever relations with Israel.
The Hamas representative said that the increasing number of martyrs and the wounded would enhance our morale and courage.
He asked the Palestinian people to stay firm and give rock-hard resistance to the enemy in the war.
Pakistan: In Pakistan, Taliban Kill Six People in North Waziristan of Tribal Areas.
The news agency Mehr has quoted with reference to Reuters that in the tribal area of Pakistan, North Waziristan, the Taliban have killed two Afghan citizens and four Pakistanis under the allegation of spying.
According to the information, on Tuesday morning, in the area of Tehsil Mir Ali, the local people found four dead bodies who were shot dead.
Whereas two bodies have been found from the capital place Miranshah, which were thrown in the market of a bazaar.
Letters also, written in Urdu, have been found in which it has been claimed that the victims were engaged in spying.
Two weeks earlier too, in the capital of North Waziristan, Miranshah, two Afghan citizens were killed under the allegation of spying.
In the last twelve days, fifteen people have been killed under the allegation of spying for America.
It should remain clear that in South and North Waziristan, during the past six years, more than one hundred people have been killed under the allegation of spying. The Taliban are alleged to be involved in these types of cases.
Barack Obama: Signing on the Orders to Close Ignominious Prison in Guantanamo Bay Expected
The news agency Mehr has copied with the reference of sources that American President will sign today the order to close the ignominious prison of Guantanamo Bay.
The new American President Barack Hussein Obama has started acting superficially on the promises made during his election campaign.
In this connection he has issued instructions for making a plan for the return of American troops from Iraq; whereas, today, the American President will sign the order to close the ignominious prison of Guantanamo Bay.
It is expected that today President Barack Obama is possibly going to sign the order according to which Guantanamo Bay prison will be closed within a year.
Besides this, orders for the review of the investigative methods on suspected terrorists and the ban on the use of foul language with the prisoners are also expected to be issued from the White House.
President Barack Obama started working on fulfilling the election promises on the first day of his presidency and has taken steps for making the actions and working of his government transparent as the priority.
The observers say that the American President has started making efforts to save the falling reputation of America on the international level, but it is very difficult for him to succeed in it, because as long as America is supporting the predator government of Israel, nothing good can be expected from her. If America wants to save its reputation, then it has to withdraw from supporting Israel and should not participate in her crimes.
Tony Blair emphasises Need to Include Islamic Organization Hamas in Conference

Blair also strongly criticized the Bush administration for talking only to Mahmoud Abbas and ignoring Hamas. It should remain clear that the Western countries, after assessing the public and administrative power of Hamas, are now talking about including it in the conference, whereas before this they used to call Hamas a terrorist organization; a terrorist organization which is defending its country and trying to emancipate its country from the grip of others, whose houses and country have been occupied for sixty years by a tyrannical government like that of Israel.

Tea: Effective Treatment for Breast Cancer
In a new research it has been said that three cups of tea
if taken daily, reduces the risk of breast cancer by more than one third in women aged less than 50 years.
In this research, done in the Moffitt Cancer Center in the state of Florida in America, it has been said that the risk of cancer of the breast tumor in the women, aged under 50,
is reduced by up to 37 percent for those who drink at least three cups of tea daily.
In the research, it was also said that the women of higher age don't get any noticeable benefits in this regard by taking three or more cups of tea daily.
The experts say that the reason of this is the presence of some elements in the tea that are effective against those tumors which occur in the women of less than 50 years.
This research was done on more than five-thousand women who were treated for breast cancer in the Moffitt Cancer Center, situated in the city of Tampa in the state of Florida.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
The experts compared their medical records and their lifestyle with those of the women who were safe from breast cancer.
The experts also came to know that tea visibly showed its effect on a special type of cancer 'lobular' which was reduced up to 66 percent.
Every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type.
This type of cancer is dangerous because of the reason that it is deep-seated and usually it is diagnosed when it has already widely spread.
The experts say that drinking at least three cups of tea daily on a regular basis may reduce the risk of breast cancer conspicuously in younger women.
They say that a proper defense is developed in the body against cancer if tea is included in the daily routine as a routine drink.
In Britain, every year, about 40-thousand women are diagnosed with breast cancer.

Why Less Exercise with Increasing Age?
New Research
Exercise is good for health at every age.
It makes your heart energetic, lowers the cholesterol level, helps in keeping weight low, helps in controlling diabetes, and slows the process of Alzheimers, meaning forgetfulness.
Unfortunately, in many people with increasing age, the ability to do exercise is reduced.
The experts say that exercise keeps our body and mind alert; however, age can affect this.
According to the American Medical Association, if exercise is not done, many health problems may be encountered.
Dr. Patricia Palika of Mayo Clinic Minnesota says that increasing age is a major cause of difficulty in doing exercises and reduction in bodily performance.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.
She led research regarding heart problems and the ability of humans in doing exercise in old age.
The team of the doctors used high frequency sonic waves to assess the performance of the heart
in which they studied the pumping of blood, its contraction, and the resting process of the heart.
The experts focused their attention on the left side of the heart, which is the main part in the pumping of blood.
They came to know that, with the increase in age, the problems are increased in the resting process of the heart.
Dr. Patricia says that with increasing age, the problems in the resting process of the heart become visible and the effect on the ability of doing exercise increases with the increase in age.
Dr. Garvin Cain participated in this study.
He says that we were surprised to see that this necessarily affects and it became clear that bad performance in the exercise can be so much associated with the resting process of the heart.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause problems in the heart process and ailments of the heart.
If doctors and the patients work together with reference to the ailments of the heart, they can get the benefits of exercise even with increasing age.
The detailed report with reference to this has been published in the journal of the American Medical Association.
No Chances of Immediate War with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief
The chief of the Indian Army General Deepak Kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan; however, to defend the country, and to assure the safety of its interests, we are ready at all times for giving sacrifices.
General Kapoor blamed that despite reassurances and pressure from the international community on Pakistan as a result of the Mumbai attacks, in his words, the infrastructure of terrorism is not only intact on Pakistani soil, but is also active.
He said this while talking to news correspondents in Srinagar.
The chief of the Indian army was on a one-day visit to the valley of Kashmir to review the collective security situation and the preparations of the army on the borders in Kashmir under the New Delhi administration.
He was asked what his comments were in reference to the media reports that Pakistan has rejected the proof presented by India with reference to the Mumbai attacks.
General Kapoor said that the decisions on the matter pertaining to war and peace are taken by the political leadership.
Talking about the alleged infrastructure of terrorism present on Pakistani soil, he said that the Indian army will face those elements who are determined to disrupt peace and to weaken India.
He said that seven-hundred to eight-hundred militants are present in the Indian Kashmir, out of which about fifty percent are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that with better weather conditions, the effort of influx from Pakistan and Kashmir under Pakistan's administration may increase; however, India has enhanced alert on the borders.
He rejected the possibility of reduction in the strength of the army deployed in the Indian-administered Kashmir by saying that the security of the country could not be compromised.
May Allah bless the world opinion and Barack proves to be a blessing for the world
although we are not hopeful, still let us see to what extent this change brings PakistaniAmerican relations to our favor
as Barack Sahib is an interpretation of Martin Luther King's dreams, what interpretation he gives to the world.
Obama, a part of whose name is also Hussein, his taking an oath today as President of America is an historic event and also a difficult test for history
not only for his own self, but also for all those who supported him with their heart and soul.
This will be a test for the white majority also, because it is not an easy task for them to accept from their hearts the government of a black man over them.
Here, the people of South Asia, especially the Muslims, who have pinned hopes on him, should bear in mind that he has been elected as the President of America and Obama should keep in mind that the President of America is practically the president of the world.
After a while from now, a person, the people of whose ethnic origin were brought to America as slaves from their respective homelands and who offered their sweat and blood to the roots of the world's most powerful modern state, today the representative of the same racially subjected nation will be called the forty-fourth President of this very America.
Many people have pinned many hopes on this person
it is important for his fans not to repose unrealistic hopes from him.
If Obama is able to emerge successful in some way in just alleviating the hatred spread in the world on the bases like religion and race, then this will be the success of his lovers.
What will be the effect of this change on South Asia and whether a meaningful change can be expected in American policy as a result of this change.
How is this policy going to impact Pakistani-American relations.
(BBC)'
My Lord, whether it is Obama or anybody else, only the billionaire, effective, strong and resourceful Jewish lobby determines the nature of policy and relationship regarding the whole world.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, in the context of recent Mumbai blasts, the aggressive attitude of the India, Israel and American triangle's is open to the whole world.
The local Taliban continue to target educational institutions in NWFP, Pakistan
The maximum number of schools that have been destroyed, lie in Sawat District, most amongst them are girls schools.
Not only this, the Taliban have also announced a ban on the education of girls in Sawat.
Thousands of male and female students are being deprived of education.
What, in your opinion, the Taliban want to achieve by banning female education.
Why has the government so far failed to control these illegal measures.
What, in your opinion, should the government do.
Even after the creation of Pakistan, for a considerably long period of time, the administration of Sawat was the responsibility of Wali-e-Sawat who maintained a regular force and law.
Under an agreement, he handed over the administration of Sawat to the Government of Pakistan.
but alas! our government treated Sawat like a stepmother.
After Wali-e-Sawat's government was over, there has been no increase in the number of schools in Sawat
and no interest was taken in the construction and development of that area.
The number of girls currently getting an education is several times less than those who used to get education in the past.
The question should be what the ISI and Pakistani agencies will get.
Because the people of Sawat have clearly understood now the game that the army is there to serve the Taliban and not for killing them, otherwise how can five schools be blasted in a single night during curfew and how can the people be hanged in the main city crossing after cutting their throats during curfew.
When the government authority is not being allowed to be established in Sawat, then in these circumstances how can the government be successful in controlling these illegal measures?
Now the question arises when the government has the army, the latest weapons, the modern technology and surveillance system, then why are they unable to control a few Taliban?
The only answer to this question is that they are being protected by some unknown power because neither their ammunition gets exhausted nor they get caught
the gist of the issue is that these Taliban, with their wicked deeds, are facilitating the job of international powers
There was war going on in Afghanistan fifteen years ago
ISI was controlling the Taliban, whereas the rival was Northern Alliance which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly the circumstances changed and the Taliban's evil agenda started coming to light
and ISI also got dollars offer from America, and as such, former friends became enemies.
The current situation is that the war is still continuing but in Pakistan supporters are the same e.g. Iran, India and Russia
Gaza is passing through the third week of Israeli attacks and the number of killings has reached about 1000.
Despite international diplomatic efforts, there is no ceasefire yet
and according to an estimate, since the start of attacks on December 27 till now, 90,000 Palestinians have moved to safer places after abandoning their homes.
The relief-providing agencies have blamed Israel for showing negligence for the safety of Palestinian children, saying that a full generation of Palestinian children will be subjected to psychological and emotional troubles.
What do you say.
What should be done?
How can a durable peace be achieved in Gaza?

Unless a man starts feeling the difference between right and wrong, he will continue to make mistakes.
For example, when a thief attempts a theft, and at that time he gets a feeling that 'theft is not a good thing and it is a curse and involves punishment and he fears God' then he will not commit theft
in a similar way unless Israel develops a feeling that it is doing wrong and killing innocent people and will be punished for this until that time Israel will continue to play with the blood of innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings!
The question is if war, armed struggle, terrorism are the solutions to problems?
If not, then what is the chemical formula that leads towards the solution of the problems?
It is true that war and terrorist methods do not solve problems but increase them.
For the success of their movements, Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should follow the same model that Nelson Mandela adopted in South Africa.
This means more than an armed struggle pursuing the path of moral and political struggles and 'self jihad.'
Taking part in the election indicates that Kashmiris have accepted this point.
The Taliban should be given the opportunity
basit, Peshawar
Be alert - if the Taliban started real jihad, then who will cut the throats of innocent people.
Who will burn girls' schools?
And if ransom money is not paid, then who will hang people with poles labeling them American agents?
These Talibans have damaged Islam so much so that none of the religions or nations has done so.
Pashtun Nomad
Kohat, Pakistan
If the entire global Muslim community together issues just a threat of attack to Israel, then you will see how much trouble America, Israel's dad, will feel
and not only will the talks for real ceasefire begin immediately, but also the ceasefire will take place.
But we cannot do anything because our Muslim rulers don't have the courage for this.
Someone should ask Ahmadinejad to take a first step because he is popular with the BBC forum for his valor.
The responsibility for the establishment of peace and human rights not only rests with Arabs or Muslims of the world, it is also the responsibility of the entire international community to raise its voice against aggression.
This horrific incident is the nastiest of all the sins Bush has committed so far.
As happens in India and Pakistan, financial corruption starts in government institutions before the close of the fiscal year on 30 June. In exactly similar style, the American administration, before the close up of its government, has given the green light to Israel to do whatever it has a desire to do.
On one hand America says that efforts will be made for the ceasefire
on the other hand, the United Nations is passing resolution after resolution but in practice both have done nothing. This only means that the UN is also trying to crush the Muslims.
All the Muslim countries should immediately withdraw their membership of the UN and lay the foundation of their own international organization.
There are many examples before us where we only see promises and resolutions from America and the United Nations, but the loss has only been for the Muslims.
What is the purpose of these tactics when the BBC wants to print nothing
where have now these journalistic principles gone when the blood of an innocent Muslim sheds BBC tries to covers itself with the fake principle of impartiality.
otherwise in their opinion they are the torch bearer of justice
saying something from their own side cannot be expected of them but they are not even printing comments
from the Muslims.
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and they kill Muslims, whereas people like you live among Muslims, call yourself a Muslim and kill the Muslims.
[syja786]
Since long in BBC forums a specific sect is being targeted, sometimes on the pretext of suicide bombings and sometimes on account of terrorist activities in India
in these anti-Islam commentaries the favorite word used is extremism
but who is extremist can be easily judged from the above comments in which writing against Iran has almost been considered to be an act of blasphemy.
When will our Muslims understand that fighting with Dejal is not possible by sword.
Looking at the bombing by Israel on unarmed people prompts our hearts to do what else other than to cry?
But the basic fault lies with that violence and killings to which we give the name of jihad and try to tarnish the beautiful face of Islam.
When a majority of Palestinians have accepted the existence of Israel, then why is Hamas firing rockets on Israel and sponsoring suicide bombings.
An inhumane attitude exists on both sides.
The American and the UN roles are again seen as the supporters of Israeli brutality.
May Allah empower the Muslim Ummah to become united, Ameen
and think about awarding the Nobel Prize to the real terrorists for terming this painful terrorist activity as a campaign against terrorism, because they are the real masterminds.
How can such large-scale terrorist activities be carried out without the backing of a big leader and everyone knows how the people behind this game.
And in such circumstances it is called 'might is right' in a simple language to do whatever you can do.
They beat us and we aren't even allowed to cry.
Arab rulers are sending medicine for the injured, coffins and money for those who died and it is being asked.
What should be done about Israeli attacks?
The real issue is that all heads of Muslim states including the rulers of Saudi Arabia are gripped in deep ignorance. They have neither any army nor a defense plan. They just assume that by providing relief goods their responsibility is over.
They should immediately take practical steps against Israel.
For example, a ban on petrol for European countries and America but sadly in them.
Greetings to all sisters and brothers!
In my opinion, in this hour of trial, giving suggestion to Hamas to give up its efforts in the name of peace is like doing injustice to hundreds of thousands of widows and orphans, and it is like proving that they are a failure.
If Israel and its supporters have crossed all boundaries of injustice, then the law of nature is that Moses will emerge from their own ranks. American and Israeli measures are acting like fertilizer for creating suicide bombers amongst the Muslims.
Due to a false confidence in power, they are unable to understand this reality.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Hamas and Israel should now reconcile so that bloodshed is stopped.
Mohammad Sarfraz, Paris, France
Correctly said.
Let us suppose that Hamas' point of view is based on 100% truth, and by doing jihad against aggression, they wish to come up with flying colors before Allah, then at least they must know that if as a result of this good action well-settled houses are deserted, then this will no longer remain a good deed.
Those who love God and His Prophet and claim to have love for their faith then love for human beings must also be a part and parcel of their faith!
As if leaving the Muslims alone, all 'those believing in Allah's book' and living on this earth should be exterminated is the command of God
*Najeeb-ur-Rehman Sieko, *Lahore [P@KI$T@N]
No, the command is not to exterminate them but to invite them to accept Islam
but for those people who conspire against religion, it has been commanded to do jihad against them
fighting against those should be continued till they stop conspiring. But that in no way means to wear a jacket and explode in a gathering.
Brothers, the murderer of innocent children will eventually face destruction.
But I want to tell my friends that Israelis who were without a shelter yesterday have become so strong today that they do not care for anybody, because the Jews are all united.
There are no Shias or Sunnis in their ranks. They are all Jews and have progressed in all fields.
Contrary to this what is the condition of the 55 Muslim countries?
They are lagging behind in all fields and they have become so helpless at this stage that enemies are beating them and they are waiting for death.
The need of the hour is that all Muslim countries should get together and formulate a strategy against Israel.
Feroz magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
and there is no other better strategy than acknowledging Israel, getting from them modern knowledge and techniques for development and allowing the world to live with peace and tranquility.
The Muslims have plenty of land and resources.
Only the correct use is required.
The first distressing aspect is that Hamas and Al Fateh cannot stand united.
Yasser Arafat and Sheikh Yassin were killed in an organized way just to weaken the only brave nation of this piece of land who is doing 'jihad' for Masjid Aqsa, and as long as Yassin and Arafat were not put out of way this was not possible.
After the death of these two leaders, the world is watching how Palestine is dispersing moment by moment
and how the Jewish lobby went on tightening its grip moment by moment.
In 1974, a prime minister from Pakistan possessed such a level of international credibility, that for the first time in history, he made all the Muslim leaders come under one roof with hundred percent attendance.
Today on his 81st birthday, is this a difficult task if this nation resolves not only to bring unity in its ranks and files
but also carry forward his unaccomplished mission (of establishment of a Muslim Commonwealth) by removing the differences among other Muslims?
Since December 27, the Israeli war plans have been to continuously bomb and attack Gaza with missiles.
In these attacks, so far more than three-hundred Palestinian people have been killed.
After air raids, Israeli tanks and armored vehicles with full preparation for ground operations have now reached the Gaza boundary.
The Security Council of the United Nations in an emergency meeting adopted a consensus resolution in which Israel and the Palestinian Authority have been asked to immediately stop hostile measures.
Israeli authorities have, however, said that they will continue with the operations within Gaza until they get an assurance that rocket firing on Israel will stop.
In your opinion, is Israel justified in saying that this action is an effort to defend the integrity of Israel?
Is the international community playing its role in this state of affairs?
Does this aggressive action have any indirect link with the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can the situation in the Middle East be expected to improve after Barack Obama, the newly elected President of America, takes the oath of his office?

This is a devil sticking to Palestine since half a century
this devil has several mouths
On several occasions this devil uses one of its mouths to condemn itself to divert the world pressure and attention
the same devil's other mouths are eating people in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan
and this devil is more afraid of Islam than anything else, because it knows that whenever it is expelled it will be only and only due to Islam, Muslim, complete Muslim faith and practical Islam, because history tells that Islam diverted many ill-mannered people to the right track
Palestine is a highly venerated place for the Muslims until the last day of this world, and its protection is of paramount importance to us
and we must also remember that it our first Qibla
and Israel, India and America will break up one day because these countries came into being only for a breakup and God will surely punish these non-believers. Sajid Sadiq, Lahore.

BBC publishes such commentaries after searching a lot.
After all, it has to maintain its credibility and impression of impartiality.
Though the BBC news is correct, the real thing is news analysis.
Which news is to be given importance and which news is to be made less important.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
In this skill, our Pakistani electronic and print media, particularly some Urdu newspapers and columnists, are now not behind in this race, who, while giving coverage to increasing extremism and terrorism here or writing about it intentionally, give a distorted view of the things based on their own mindset.
=Where is the United Nations, who apparently talks about human rights and peace, but brutality and aggression against the Muslims reaches at its peak, and we hear these very words from them asking Hamas to end fighting for how long will this dual policy continue to operate.
Why is so much brutality being committed against the Muslims if people like America cease to back the Jews then Allah has clearly said that they will live the life of a humiliated nation, and this nation can never live a right life then Americans! If you have courage, then quit backing them and then see the life of their fortune.
The so-called judges of the world and those who justify killings in the name of peace must clearly understand that peace in the world can only be established by dispensing justice and not through injustice and ethnic cleansing.
If the acquisition of the intended result would have been possible through the elimination of a particular human race by mass genocide, then there would have been no Jews left alive after the measures that Hitler took and their rise today would have been impossible.
In the words of a poet
Brutality is darkness which when increases gets vanished
Blood is an ink which when drops becomes everlasting
Now who will tell who what is terrorism?
Does this all not come under the definition of terrorism; why everyone feels only his own pain
are other people not human beings or the blood of the Muslims have become so cheap; was the blood color of so many innocents not red.
and why aren't any messages of condolence coming from anywhere now?
I saw the happenings of the Mumbai attacks just as if my own home had caught fire, that the pains of human beings cannot be seen and does nobody not see this pain; May it so happen that the Muslims start thinking 'unitedly!'
Dead bodies lying on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces dipped in a bloodbath, how to condemn, as we don't have words for this.
We feel like weeping on the helpless state of the Muslims, as on one hand, when people are killed in India, the whole world rushes towards Pakistan without proof, urging to take action, or otherwise they will take action themselves
on the other hand, Israel is openly eliminating the Muslims and the world is silent; this is unbearable.
With Allah, there is a delay but no injustice, and when this brutality will end, then--
In the presence of America, danger to Israel's stability is a joke.
As far as election is concerned for earning public popularity, the people in power may carry on with this type of activity, no doubt in that, particularly the state of Israel; and as far as Barack Obama is concerned, history stands witness to the fact that until today, no American leader went against the policy and will not do so in the future; imperialism being black or white makes no difference at all.
The current discussion in the forum indicates that everyone feels pain for the death of Benazir, but as a politician, her mistakes have not been overlooked.
Whether Benazir give her life for democracy or for the government is still a debatable question.
If she had a love for democracy, then why did she wait for ten years until American clearance and finalization of a deal while leaving democratic institutions to be looked after by Musharraf's dictatorship?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan at a time when people affected with dictatorship needed her, but unfortunately she came only when sureties of clearance from court cases and power were given.
There is no one to raise any voice against the criticism and allegations being leveled upon an historic person.
Sana Khan
Certain things are ignored on the grounds that nothing can be done about them.
another reader
Respectable Mr./Ms. perhaps you read the history about (Sir) not only in Pakistan but also in four friendly countries and seven other countries perhaps you may agree with Sieko Sahib.
Tariq Ayaz
'Those who are unfit in training cannot make them skillful
despite in water, barely a bud didn't turn green'
The United Kingdom did not allow them to become united and invented the Hindu Muslim conflict, which was groomed by Sir Syed.
Sieko
Our nation is so unkind that they become blind while writing praises about themselves and in the honor of their parties, but now every historical person is being subjected to so much allegations and criticism, and no one is raising their voices against this.
we have made enough progress.
Sana Khan
Certain things are ignored, considering that nothing can be done about them. In a similar way, loading books on the back of a donkey cannot make it learned.
Although in the wake of Mumbai attacks a deadlock has occurred in the continuing consultations processes but Pak-India should keep these consultations ongoing.
If they will talk about war, then there will be loss of human lives on both sides.
India says that the person caught in the Mumbai attacks is from Pakistan, and he has also written and sent a letter to Pakistan in Urdu, but on the other hand, when India got hold of this extremist, they said that he is a highly-qualified engineer, but later on, they said that he is educated only up to four class. This is strange.
First of all, Merry Christmas to Bhana Sahib and all Christian friends of this forum.
Greetings to forum friends, Sieko Sahib, A Raza, sister Sana, sister Shahida Akram and all.
All of us need flowers of peace and not flames of war!
War is itself a problem
War cannot give solution to problems
Today it will generate blood and fire
Tomorrow it will give hunger and poverty
and, therefore wise people
it is better to postpone the war
In yours and our courtyards
better light continue to stay
India-America relations have become sufficiently deeper, and India certainly understands that in the hour of need, America will openly deceive Pakistan.
This is the old history of America.
Whereas in the case of the Indian attacks, America will achieve its objectives, and that, too, at the Indian cost.
Pakistan should clearly announce that we will not be the first to attack, but in case of aggression, the talks for peace, reconciliations and ceasefire will take place only when we have either completely destroyed India or have occupied it, no matter if we ourselves get completely destroyed.
This is the Islamic history
Even before this resolution, the Pakistan army and the public has already conveyed the message that they wanted to pass on.
Indian efforts in seeking compensation for the Mumbai attacks in terms of extraordinary diplomatic and military benefits indicate that it is crying more than it was originally affected that is why contrary to initial strong international reaction, the world has now released pressure on Pakistan.
The United Nations paying no heed to needless Indian cries and expressing satisfaction over Pakistan's efforts, and the Head of Interpol praising Pakistan's efforts, are the 'side effects' of India's unnecessary diplomatic efforts.
There are no two opinions that this is a severe brutal act.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the village of Pir Samiullah where was the Pakistan army at that time and what it was doing?
Should the army not be held accountable for what they did during the one-year stay over there?
How may Taliban are killed with thousands of mortar and gun shells that the army sprays each day?
I appeal the ISI please for God's sake leave patronizing Taliban and let us live in peace in the beautiful valley of Sawat
and close up this bogus operation.
That day is not far when a UN resolution for armed intervention in Pakistan will be passed in a similar way as has been in the case of Jamaat Al-Dawa.
Riaz Ahmad Farooqi
First of all, our extremists and their supporters are themselves continuously providing all proofs and justifications for action against them, and it is clear that whenever such a resolution is presented in the United Nations, no voice will be raised in our favor,
and if the passing of such a resolution gets delayed, then any of the powers following the example of America will run over us on the basis of self-help.
We are not aware and have no information about the personality and achievements of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionary.
The matter in which the dead bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Bugti, Doctor Najeebullah and several thousand other revolutionart were insulted by enemies.
They are alive even after death.
But here an international game is being played and, the people are being ruled by making them afraid of terror and brutality.
A justification is being created that if we are not here, then the terrorists and fanatics will take over the reign of government.
This act of these so-called Islam lovers in the name of religion is highly deplorable.
The supporters of these extremists can see the aggressions of America, but instead of cutting a sorry figure on brutal actions like this one, they give it the name of a tribal culture and in this way change track.
A person with a good heart cannot provide justifications for this type of brutal act, neither under the umbrella of tribal culture nor in the name of Islam.
In my opinion, our army is supporting these people.
It is because when these people move, it surely takes time. There is enough time to arrest them, but they run away - even if they are present at the occasion, let alone reaching the spot.
Are they so brave that they hold fifty, seventy people as hostages, and our army watches them as a spectator doing nothing.
Both the army and these people are Allah's creation.
It is evident that something is black at the bottom.
The religious scholars since the truly dictatorial regime of dictator of the world Zia-ul-Haq, contrary to projecting God's attributes of kindness and affection, have been creating an atmosphere of fear and terror by telling countless stories of punishments and admonitions in the name of religion, in which the incident of hanging dead bodies and additionally their literature and books like 'What will happen after death' are also creating fear and terror.
And with a purpose to gain worldly prestige, these people are using fear and terror as a tool.
'O' religious speakers!
You frightened the world so much from the hell fire
That your face turned into the face of fear'
It surprises us when it is said that this cannot be the activity of a Muslim.
We are ignorant of our own history or intentionally avoid it.
As a result of a refusal to offer allegiance after the death of the Prophet, who burned down the closed door of the daughter of God's Messenger and, who dragged her husband after putting a rope around his neck?
Did they come from somewhere outside?
Were Yazid's army attack on Medina and the incident of Karbala the acts of Hindus and Jews?
Without accepting facts, neither motives can be eliminated nor remedies made.
Those running BBC should stop dual policy.
More super hit topic than this: 'Was throwing shoes on Bush right or wrong?'
should have been
Tahir Chaudhry, Japan
My friend, feel a little bit of shame a person was taken out from the grave and hanged with a pole merely because he raised his voice against aggression, and you are interested more in box office topic.
The success of Operation Sherdil - and, on the other side of the border, the victory of Operation Lion Heart - depends on whom the general public opinion supports.
This is the work of American and Pakistani intelligence agencies and Pir Sahib has fallen prey to this conspiracy.
On this forum, now all commentaries will be anti-Taliban, because intelligence agencies' persons have successfully entered in the Taliban ranks, and they are taking such measures that can alter general public opinion.
I would just like to ask that, when, for a full one day this dead body remained hanging, then what the army people were doing there; are they sitting there only to target the general population. They give statements like this: 'Bombing on Taliban hideouts, shelling on house kills 2 children and their mother'.
Were they not aware of this crossing?
Or they were watching a game?
We request you to please close this game for the sake of God.
After all, there is a Ruler above you, as well.
Even if the question asked by the BBC is rational or irrational, we feel sorry to observe the superficial knowledge of writers, for example no one asked the question that, what was the objective before thirty thousand soldiers went to Sawat?
Those who help the army and fight the Taliban, their dead bodies keep hanging with street poles the whole day.
Whatever treatment the people of Sawat received from the army was not respectable, but the media, including the BBC, has done no good by keeping the real fact away from the world.
The Pakistan army is playing a game.
Everyone in Sawat says that this is a bloody drama.
Please stop it, for God's sake.
These Taliban have tarnished Muslims' name.
If in the whole world, true Muslims do not consider them Muslim then why they allow terrorists to live in their areas.
Those who are unconcerned about their self respect and cannot do hard work, they take a gun and join their group.
Islam did not come through the force of gun or sword.
Feel ashamed.
It has no justification, neither in any religion nor in any family tradition.
The whole media, including BBC broadcasts commentaries on the subject of the Taliban and tribes through different sources
but no one knows what is the real situation, we are the only people who have knowledge of this because we are tribal.
In brief, this is a game in which the CIA, RAW, Mossad and our own ISI are participating; there is no Taliban or tribe; these troublemakers have been created by these institutions and they are tarnishing Islam, Taliban, Islamic religious schools, the Pushtoon nation, tribes and tribal traditions.
As a result of this deed, the heads of all Muslims have bowed down with shame.
I solute MQM leader Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who raise voice against this cancer i.e. Taliban.
This cancer is the creation of Zia-ul-Haq, who himself died, but with that also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that the present leadership will be able to put an end to this cancer.
After the Mumbai attacks, India has alleged that these strikes were backed by some extremist elements in Pakistan.
Pakistan refuted these allegations and said it will extend all help to India in investigation.
India said that it has given a list of the names of 20 suspected extremists to Pakistan who are wanted by India.
Now Pakistan has said that the head of Jaish-e-Muhammad, Maulana Masood Azhar included in this list is not under house arrest and the Government of Pakistan does not know the whereabouts of this person.
Earlier the President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari refuted the impression that Western intelligence agencies and the Indian government have provided Pakistan with evidence with respect to the Mumbai attacks.
Referring to Ajmal Qasab, President Zardari said it has not yet been proven whether he is a Pakistani national.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that Indian relations with Pakistan cannot improve as long as their land is being used for terrorism purposes.
And in the latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled its tour of Pakistan.
Should these political incidents influence games?
What kind of relationships do you foresee between India and Pakistan?
Neither America nor India will break Pakistan.
Pakistanis themselves will break Pakistan.
What do you expect, after looking at the extent of provincialism, sectarianism and fundamentalism.
Time has also proven that Jinnah did not do good to the Muslims of India.
yasmin, Chicago
Madam! If work on Jinnah's vision remained continued, then neither the cancer of provincialism, sectarianism and fundamentalism would have spread in Pakistan, nor were the Muslims in India treated in this way.
But the mistake is ours, because we could not produce a leader of his standing.
If we cannot value our heroes then
Capabilities exist in abundance in this piece of land.
God knows when they will understand, and with the blessing of unity, this land will progress.
In both the countries, anti-peace elements Mullah, Pundit, Taliban, Shiv Sena, RSS etc. have been developed.
Invisible forces do not want this piece of land to progress with peace, and that is why they are made to face great trouble.
Can you imagine if Pakistan, India and China stand united in this region then what will be their status in the world.
God's wrath has fallen on Pakistan that is why the nation is being forcibly ruled by thieves, dacoits and plunderers.
May God keep our country Pakistan under protection all the time. God, please accept our prayer!
But Sahib! If you look at the circumstances and ground realities around you with open eyes, you will see how far the American armed forces have reached.
Apart from this, the affairs of the state are not looking better, either. The state of affairs in NWFP, Balochistan and Karachi in Sindh are open to you.
In these circumstances, the country needs a leader who can make us united as one nation.
Oh God, bless us with your kindness
In my view, a last war is the need of the hour.
It is too much.
The matter should be decided now.
This issue cannot be resolved with hypocrisy dialogue tricks.
And neither by launching minor terrorist acts in each other's countries.
Even Europe, too, got satisfied, only after fighting final the final World War.
If the World War has not been fought, like India and Pakistan, they too would have still been involved in hue and cry.
As a result of the Mumbai attacks
India-Pakistan contacts have become tense, and the improvement of relations between the two countries in recent years has been badly shaken.
India is continuously holding the active and non-active fighters groups in Pakistan responsible
and bringing relationships back to normalcy is being linked with action against these groups.
Whereas the Indian security agencies have held Lashkar-e-Taiba directly responsible for the Mumbai attacks,
in this context the name of Jamaat-ud-Dawa has also come up again and again.
This is not the first time that a terrorist activity in India turned the relationships between two countries tense.
As a result of the attack on Indian Parliament in December 2001, these two neighboring countries moved close to the brink of war.
After this, in 2002, Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned and included in the list of terrorist groups.
Now a ban on Jamaat-ud-Dawa is being demanded, which the security analysts say is the new face of Lashkar-e-Taiba.
In your opinion, do you think this group should be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take a decisive action against extremist groups active on its soil?
Is putting a ban on Jamaat-ud-Dawa
can avoid the present India-Pak crisis and how much more important is the ban on armed groups for establishing perpetual peace between the two countries?
Almost all our political parties have a consensus that terrorism and sectarianism should be eradicated from the country.
But our army leadership does not look honest in this, because on one hand, they assure America and Europe that we are with you in the fight against terrorism, whereas on the other hand, they also secretly support the Taliban.
We have to think now and determine our direction and have to choose only one path, thanks
There is no doubt that a great majority in Jamaat-ud-Dawa consists of those who were formerly members of Lashkar-e-Taiba and after its banning, they entered the other organization created with the name of Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan.
However, after this, its members preferred doing relief work, and now, upon India's continued pressure, the United Nations has banned it too, and the government of Pakistan is also continuing a crackdown against this organization.
In my opinion, all these fighter groups, instead of pursuing religious extremism, if carry on religious and relief activities that would be far better.
This news is breaking the heart into pieces.
What type of world is this, where a person who only mentions the name of an important member of Islamic religion gets into trouble?
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims, but if a Muslim just tries to even the score, then the non-Muslim world together with our insincere leaders badly treat those truthful, sincere and faithful people who have pain in their hearts for divine religion, and today they are giving the same treatment to our great leader Hafiz Saeed.
The terrorist organizations active in Pakistan who patronize criminals in the name of jihad, they and the 'leaders' of these Mullas have been giving Pakistan the name of Paledistan and many more names.
Now they are leaving no stone unturned to destroy Pakistan.
In fact, not to talk of Muslims, they cannot even be called humans.
Without cleaning out these wicked people from Pakistan, the safety of the country will be in danger.
Do we still need to think whether a ban should be imposed on these seditious people or not?
There is no place for violent Mullas in this world, whose only role is killing.
The Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamaat Al-Dawa; but what are the proofs on the basis of which the Security council demonstrated such a hurry?
Does the Security Council not always show so much haste against Muslims only?
This is called 'witness is more efficient than petitioner'!
If we see, India has itself become a failed state!
Whose intelligence, army and other security institutions have failed because a few terrorists gave them a tough time for 72 hours - and India, by putting the blame of its failures on Pakistan, is deceiving the whole world.
If one non-believer is killed, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why is this double standard?
The beloved country's only non-political, religious and welfare organization...
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Holy Prophet (SAWS), saints and suffis gave love and respect to all people, the religion of Islam continued to expand and progress with peace and harmony.
The Muslims, too, made progress in all fields.
But when this beautiful faith landed in the hands of Mullahaism, the differences in the human race in the form of believer and non-believer started to emerge, opening new doors of disorder and anarchy of which the world was unaware before.
Salam. Do it with a happy mode, but do this work on your own.
Don't do it under pressure from America.
If India feels uncomfortable, it should provide proof.
Why doesn't it give?
And why does it blame us for everything?
There are extremist groups and organizations in India, too, then why do they not impose a ban on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the whole world?
What should we call it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What should we call it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the first Islamic nuclear state and the issue is why we are.
Pakistan is now standing on its last leg.
kamranhassan, ABU DHABI
Your comments touch our hearts, and the circumstances are not different.
Now Pakistan's new map is being boldly published in American journals and the process of bans is a continuation towards the same path.
The Americans are now tightening their grip on Pakistan - not slowly, but very quickly.
In this situation, if we as a nation do not demonstrate unity and harmony, then keep in mind that if Bangladesh can be created, then much else can happen.
To whatever extent the terrorist attacks are condemned is not enough; whether these are attacks in Mumbai, the Islamabad Marriot Hotel or in Palestine.
In a similar way, the terrorists should be eliminated regardless of whatever region they belong to; whether they are Pakistanis, Indians, Americans or Israelis.
Now the question arises of terrorist attacks in Pakistan that take place each day in which hundreds of people are killed, but why does the whole world, including Pakistani authorities, keep silent?
Was the strike on the Marriot not a terrorist attack?
Then why?
We are ready to sacrifice ourselves for Adviser on Interior Affairs, Mr. Rahman Malik, who with the grace of God has become so much braver and courageous!
According to BBC, (a committee of) the Security Council of the United Nations has imposed a ban on Jamaat Al-Dawa, whereas Mr. Malik says we have not imposed any ban and it will be done only after much deliberation.
In addition to this, according to BBC, Mr. Malik has also rejected this impression with full force that the arrests of terrorist groups are being carried out 'on the advice of someone'.
Brother, God is great!
The security forces in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir raided a camp allegedly linked with the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba.
After the Mumbai attacks, pressure is mounting on Pakistan to expedite action against terrorist outfits.
India alleges that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
The American Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has asked Pakistani leadership to take immediate and transparent, practical actions against those responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
She says that there is no doubt that the terrorists who attacked Mumbai used Pakistani soil.
Meanwhile, authorities in Peshawar said that unknown armed men burned down another depot of trucks providing supply to allied forces in Afghanistan, and this resulted in the destruction of more than 50 trucks.
In Peshawar, within the last 48 hours, this is the second attack on the NATO and American supply line.
Meanwhile, Pakistan raided a camp of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba. Before this, attempts have been made to disarm the armed groups from Karachi to tribal areas. They were assured of payment and no action in return for ammunition.
The circumstances indicate that the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan during General Zia-ul-Haq's regime and resistance thereof by the armed groups formed by funding from America and Saudi Arabia cannot be eliminated now, and any efforts to take Pakistan back to the pre-nineteen hundred &amp; eighty position by trying to do this have not been successful.
The question is: does Pakistan want to do this?
Does Pakistan have the capability to do this?
What do you say?

Whether possess the capability or not and saying do not need.
Whose fight are we Pakistanis fighting?
And we have our own interests which we will protect with full effort.
No one has the right to interfere in others' country affairs.
Colonial regime is apparently not seen.
If the people become hopeful of getting justice or the allies emphasize the functioning of an independent judiciary, respect the democratic institutions and extend no help to a dictator or soldier, then there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan, but this is perhaps unacceptable to the allies.
Pakistan is always for no reason busy in pursuit of submission to the European and American objectives.
Despite the opposition of a dominant population size, this has to be practiced.
And this thing further raises anti emotions.
If America and its allies believe in democracy, then they should give up the colonial practice and respect the sovereignty of state they should leave this region.
Pakistan poses this much capability to arm or disarm itself.
I have only one question from all the flag holders of humanity:
If you kill their children and in turn expect them to come to you with open arms is impossible
Saeed, Multan
And my question is, does all wisdom ranging from Islamic to Eastern and Western, any logic, rational and philosophy gives permission to kill innocent public, including those who pray, laborers and poor employees, only to get the revenge of American strikes.
If the answer is no, then there is a strong need to get your point of view rectified.
The people were given arms because of the concern that Russia after Afghanistan would move towards Pakistan and, therefore, these people were given arms.
Now, when there is a concern that America will attack Pakistan through Afghanistan - and this has been openly indicated by the existing American President in his presidential election campaign - then why should we disarm these people?
Only for the reason that after overpowering the Pakistan army, America or India do not have to face public resistance of any type.
Yes, if any one among them is found involved in terrorist activities, only Pakistan should take action against him.
But sorry to say that the government's action against Lashkar-e-Taiba made the Indian point of view correct that Pakistan is involved in this.
Najeeb-ur-Rehman Sieko, Lahore [P@KI$T@N]
If it is accepted that Lashkar-e-Taiba in involved, then implicating the Pakistan government is also incorrect.
Another question is whether these terrorists were supported by any governmental or non-governmental employee of India?
And whether terrorists are only born or created in Pakistan and not created in India and other countries of the world?
As far Lashkar-e-Taiba is concerned, recent terrorist activities have no linkages with them.
The thing that must be kept in mind is that Hafiz Saeed was the first 'jihadi leader' who termed the activities of the Taliban a 'sedition'.
I have a strong belief that Taliban activities are an integral part of the American planning, and any person or group who challenges the Taliban on any pretext, it becomes essential for them to clear him from their way.
Despite support from the whole nation, taking action against Lashkar under Indian pressure indicates Zardari and Company's anxiety and their sycophant nature.
To bring this mission, launched with the American and Saudi funding, to an end, a request should be made to both of them saying that in the name of God please clean up this filth that has poisoned our society.
Also record a protest with them saying that on what moral grounds the American and Saudis together spread dangerous arms and so-called jihadis, but in reality the virus of contemptuous literature and culture, as a result of which human slaughter houses were opened up in our country.
After the danger of Indian attack, the Pakistan army's announcement that they will withdraw their forces from the Afghan border to pay attention to India and, subsequently, the Taliban's announcement that they will take care of Afghan borders disturbed the Americans, who did their utmost to avoid an Indian attack on Pakistan.
This fully exposed the secret of American strength in this region.
Though India neither issued the threat for attack nor it has the courage to do this.
The rest of the task was fulfilled by the Taliban's attack on the American supply line.
It has been proven that without the support of the Pak Army and government, America is nothing.
Karachi being Pakistan's financial and commercial hub is a Dubai for all under-developed areas.
Hundreds of thousands of people never return empty-handed from this city, but the absence of rules of law in western border areas, Karachi has invited the attention of all.
Now they are bent upon the abduction of this city.
For the first time, Pathans are being regarded as Pukhtoons, due to which the residents of the same city are made to fight as strangers, whereas the need is for unity.
One solution to the problem is that either those who speak Urdu should learn Pushto or those who speak Pushto should learn Urdu or much better if all learn English.
You will certainly treat it as a ridiculous proposal, but don't you feel the reason for conflict as being silly?
That language is the cause of violence?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, in my childhood, I presented this proposal many times to my friends consisting of people from all religious and linguistic groups, but they used to laugh at these proposals.
At that time, these linguistics and religious hatred was not as powerful and strong as this is today but was internally gathering strength.
Do not understand what and why is happening?
Are these signs of the day of judgment?
For what offense are the innocent and blameless being killed?
Reasons are in front of us all - the same people who want to turn Pakistan into pieces are active, and they don't have any country or religion.
Whether it is Karachi or Mumbai, both have been burned by their own people.
Whichever government comes into power, they start earning their name by changing the names of places, for example, these days airport, road, building are all Benazir.
Does the "treatment" being meted out to the people of Karachi and Pakistan be called "Benazir"?
When the Mumbai attacks were at their peak, the failure of an attempt to start linguistic disturbances in Karachi proves that those who were at the payroll of RAW in the past have now resigned.
The sleeping Pakistanism has been awakened from Karachi to Khyber by the killings of innocent Pushtoon laborers and the Indian threats.
A strong, uniform patriotic reaction from all political, religious, linguistic and national parities has not only taught India the diplomatic norms, it has also provided Americans with another opportunity to think about.
Mutahiddah and ANP are responsible for the bad situation in Karachi, whereas the administration is partially.
The administration can control the situation within one hour, but they are intentionally backing it
It avoids taking action due to pressure on the police and the rangers from the political parties.
The talks about unity are limited only to giving statements; political parties should leave their own interests and work for the well-being of the common man.
As long as the political pressure on the administration continues, similar incidents will happen; may Allah keep Pakistan under His protection.
In my opinion these are the biggest terrorists.
And essentially some foreign powers are involved in this, but we don't know who is that?
But sorry to say that if there has been a similar situation in any of the cities in Frontier, the government would have treated it roughly. Since it is not in Frontier, the government looks helpless.
The government must initiate an operation here to save the largest and important city of the country from terrorism.
Otherwise, Pakistan will have to face a big financial crisis.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth, due to fear, whereas the condition of Pakistani media is considerably thin.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that those who speak Urdu learn Pushto or those who speak Pushto learn Urdu or much better if all learn English.
You will certainly term this suggestion a funny one, but don't you consider the reason for conflict a funny one?
That the cause of violence be language.
At last another story of brutality was recorded in Karachi the fear of which was long been felt by every citizen.
Everyone did his best and spared no effort. The facts reported on media are only 50% of what actually happened here during the four days.
Spent the last three nights sleepless and still there is a fear.
All those who get hotels evacuated, kill cobblers and peanut sellers,
commit highway robberies and cut the ears of innocents are all unaware of Allah's wrath, which will grip them some day.
What in your opinion are the causes of this sudden unrest?
(BBC)
Keeping before us the heart-shaking carnage in Mumbai, we don't have to dive deep at all to find out the cause of unrest in Karachi, but the simple and easy reason is that the unrest is caused unconsciously as a result of blood's uncontrolled motion.
It is very clear that if someone teases the 'father' then it will not be surprising if his 'son' gets out of control.
The blood of Liaquat Ali Khan and many other faithful belonged to the same place. To remove the misunderstanding of Mr. Sieko, I am writing this stanza
We too will repeat the tradition of forefathers
We gave life for its creation and will give life to save it.
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
It is a matter of great sorrow that the whole country is now at risk, but we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, my submission is that if we
look in wikipedia.org we will find that Liaquat Ali Khan belonged to a respectable Punjabi family of the Karnal area of Punjab province.
Due to his hard work for refugees, they call him their own man.
Every action is bound to have a reaction.
Can bear it with for one's own person
Ejaz Awan
Sir, before you, too, gather a huge crowd of proposers within a night, I must tell you that the open signs of real wickedness are these days seen on the walls of Karachi in the shape of wall writings and posters.
We have been experiencing both types of wickedness.
The wicked people have not spared Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan; they did not have to face any reaction.
They are still plundering the same Pakistan.
Only Muslim League N was left, but it too drafted and handed over the Eighteenth Amendment bill to the Peoples Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q have submitted their draft Eighteenth Amendment bills to the National Assembly and the Senate.
So far, it seems that drafts for the Eighteenth Amendment are political tricks, and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is because of the same reason that no one has so far made any hue and cry in favor of this amendment on the floor of the Assembly or the Senate and forced the houses to approve this amendment.
It appears that after submitting the draft Eighteenth Amendment, these parties have created a proof of their effort, which means they are now able to tell the people tomorrow that they had submitted the amendment, but the speaker of the government party did not process it.
MQM is a coalition partner of the government, Muslim league N is a hidden ally of the government, whereas Muslim League Q is a party responsible for passing the Seventeenth Amendment. How, then, can it be possible for these parties to be sincere in doing away with the Seventeenth Amendment.
This is clearly an excuse to claim a big reward for a marginal effort.
Anyway, the Peoples Party is not in a hurry to eliminate the Seventeenth Amendment.
How can one think of cutting his own hands.
As long as Zardari is president, the Seventeenth Amendment is unlikely to be done away with.
This was the majority opinion in one of our surveys and this is true as well.
Zardari would not have become the President if there had been any intention to do away with the Seventeenth Amendment.
Now he is even stronger than President Pervez, because in addition to being President, he is also the Peoples Party Chairperson.
The Seventeenth Amendment will stay as long as he is the President.
Before eliminating the Seventeenth Amendment, the political parties will have to make President Zardari say goodbye to the President House.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
The majority of the elders in my family belonged to the labor class
and when we used to see our paternal and maternal uncles doing the job of a daily laborer, a wish in our heart always prompted us to request Allah to keep us away from the work involving physical labor.
To be saved from this, I wrote a letter to the editor of Daily Imroz asking him what to do after Matric so as to avoid physical labor.
The editor in his reply advised to become a doctor or engineer and suggested the reading of specific subjects.
From the beginning I was interested in engineering, that is why I studied technical drawing instead of biology.
But at the time of admission in F.Sc., my elder brother forced me to become a doctor by doing F.Sc. in pre-medical.
I barely studied biology for a month, but, being unable to understand it, opted to take up mathematics.
This means that the fear of physical labor helped me to become an engineer, and now among the family members of the same age group, I am in a comparatively better position for which I am always thankful to God.
This story came to my mind at a time when I, along with my two young sons, was trying to take away the carpets of our old house.
Hardly half an hour had passed after we started doing this job when my younger son said, "Dad! It seems as if I have not been created for this job."
I said if it is true, then work as hard with your study as I did, and then you will get rid of physical labor.
My son replied that I am studying and will complete it too, but I cannot do this work.
All three of us finished this job by hook or by crook in three hours and returned home.
The purpose of telling this story is that if a person has selected his destination with whatever background reasons, no one can stop him from reaching his destination.
Well if you don't know what to do, then it will be very hard to succeed.
It is said that those who have died should not be blamed, but what should be done when we only see faults in Benazir, even at her first death anniversary.
Just to safeguard her own interests, Benazir provided the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India and thus on one hand crushed the independence movement of Sikhs and on the other hand allowed India an opportunity to pay full attention to Kashmir after having suppressed the movement in Punjab.
The power tussle between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif is a part of history that pushed the country several years back.
During the period of her exile, Benazir continued to issue negative statements about Kashmir and the atomic program.
Violating the agreement signed with Nawaz Sharif in London, Benazir entered into a deal with General Musharraf.
While in power, Benazir provided her husband with an opportunity to earn money in whatever ways he could, and this is why he was named as Mr. ten percent.
While Benazir was in power her brother was murdered, but his killers are still safe from punishment.
Despite being a woman, Benazir avoided fighting for the rights of women.
Just as Benazir did politics on the dead body of her father, in a similar style her widowed husband is doing politics on her dead body.
Benazir came into power twice, but not to talk of giving punishment to those involved in the political murder of her father, she even failed to get a case registered against them.
Thirty-seven years have passed since the separation of East Pakistan from us, and look at the extreme of apathy that our public and rulers have demonstrated by neither mourning nor showing any regrets for their mistakes on this day.
We should have celebrated 16 December as a day of admonition and taken measures to prevent the reoccurrence of similar happenings.
We should have sent the messages of goodwill on this day to the people of Bangladesh and tried to bring them closer to us again.
Rulers should have opened the file of the Hamood-ur-Rahman Commission and pondered upon the reasons for separation of East Pakistan.
We should have taken measures to bring back the stranded Biharis in Bangladesh and sent them gifts for encouragement.
But we have turned so senseless that if someone dies in our neighborhood, we have no information about this.
We don't have any concerns for our sisters and brothers because we have become selfish.
Even after the occurrence of the greatest of tragedies, we get deeply occupied the next day with the usual affairs of life.
Would that as East and West Germany became united again, in a similar style East and West Pakistan too had become united again.
We can become united again if we sacrifice for each other and get out of the shell of selfishness.
But this desire is not likely to be fulfilled in the near future.
News came in today's broadcast saying that the Governor of the State of Illinois in the United States has been arrested for corruption charges.
To remove him from the governorship, the provincial congress has moved very quickly with the preparation for his accountability. An American white man who keeps a careful eye on Pakistan's affairs boastfully challenged me by citing this example of democracy.
In America, even the powerful are not above the law.
And in your country Pakistan, even the president came into power after getting corruption charges dropped against himself.
I responded in a joking way, saying that the arrest of a governor in America is totally worthless if compared with Pakistan, where one prime minister was arrested and hanged and another was exiled in no time.
Tell me if this has even happened in America.
In Pakistan, the one who broke the constitution was offered a guard of honor before his departure from the presidential palace; tell me if this has ever happened in America?
In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was suspended, and despite public support, he has not been reinstated up to now; has this happened in America?
In Pakistan, a fake degree holder was made the minister for health, has this happened in America?
After listening to this, the poor American laughed too much and accepted his defeat.
Despite being surrounded by the Americans from all four sides, President Zardari is still smiling in this picture.
His smile is an indication
of his feeling that America is backing his government, but he is forgetting that a year ago the same people were supporting Pervez Musharraf.
The picture has been portrayed as if it is a family picture.
This type of picture, showing three American delegates with a president, has not been published in the newspapers before.
It seems the American responsibility has increased in Pakistan and now it needs more than one employee to carry it out, or the level of their trust on the new slave is not as high as was for the previous one.
It may also be possible that, keeping in view President Zardari's reputation of backtracking, they had to make this arrangement.
If there has been a sensible leader, he would at least have avoided putting his teeth on show and, his face would obviously have exhibited the shame of slavery.
If the principle of democracy is applied to this picture, then President Zardari is in the minority.
In accordance with democracy, only the majority has a government in the country, and who is that this picture is telling.
In the troubled area of Sawat in the Frontier province, even with the continuing military operations for the last one year, the situation is increasingly becoming worse.
On one hand, writ of the government in this area is now limited only to passing a condemnation resolution in the National Assembly, whereas on the other hand, the influence of the Taliban's illegal FM radio channel is significantly increasing in Sawat.
Thirdly, a common man deems it safe to be showing submissiveness to those who are practically in control of this area.
In Sawat, killing of extremists is claimed as a result of shelling from gunship helicopters and artillery fires during security forces operations, but even with these killings, the Taliban have not only gathered more strength, but, according to an estimate, they are in control of 80% of the Sawat area.
The result is that on one hand, the government is not ready to accept its failures, and on the other hand, the Taliban are strong.
Who is being crushed in between - the poor citizens!
In Sawat someone asked how are the Taliban? The reply came that they are very good, because they are the custodians of Allah's code of life and are fighting against 'enemies of Allah and the religion of Allah'.
Another question was asked, how is army? The answer received said very well, because it is 'defending the country and fighting against the enemies of the country'.
Then it was asked who is the enemy of Allah's Code of life and the country? The reply was "we the public".
The paradise like Sawat is also called Pakistan's Switzerland.
So far, as per governmental strategy, negotiations are continuing along with the use of force.
But the use of force is not giving any paybacks, except helping to increase the Taliban's strength and creating sympathies for them among the public.
What is needed is that instead of using force, the government should eliminate the causes of this problem.
By eliminating the causes, Fazlullah and the Taliban will be eliminated automatically.
The Shariah bill proposed by the ANP Government will solve Sawat problems to a greater extent.
But along with the enforcement of Shariah, the government shall also side by side have to pay attention to the economic issues
It appeared on the basis of initial steps taken by Musharraf that perhaps this nation will be liberated from incapable politicians, but the lust for power changed all his intentions
whatever the expectations were, his participation in the 'war on terror' made him think that he has become an invincible man
and the measures that were expected from him disappeared.
As the government of Bush started coming to an end, Musharraf started feeling concerned about the end of his rule and in a state of perturbation he entered into a deal with thieves.
General Musharraf could control the army, but the current government does not know what is going on.
Whether it is Bajur or Sawat, the army cannot control terrorists and resort to shelling on the 'enemy' - i.e. the public - which in addition to resulting in losses to human lives and material also making people psychologically sick; so who is the enemy except us!
I am surprised how the Pakistan army will fight with the Indian army when it cannot control a small group of Taliban.
They could not track an illegally-run FM Channel of Taliban, which I think is very simple.
But still, it is spreading poisonous propaganda with full might.
After girls schools, boys schools are now being destroyed.
Curfew is imposed so as to facilitate the movement of Taliban.
Last night during curfew hours, they penetrated the suburbs of Mangora and made hideouts.
The question arises as to how they reached there during curfew hours.
The army can kill Akbar Bugti in his house and salutes Talibans.
For God's sake, someone make this army understand to help free the defenseless people of Sawat out of the grips of the Taliban and prove that the Pakistan army can overpower any kind of enemy.
The respectable gentleman says that in the world, most of the bloodshed was caused by religion. You tell me if there had been no religion at all, had this bloodshed not happened.
Are Punjabi, Pathan, white, black, Mehsud and other tribes the products of religion?
No, not at all. Sir, only religion teaches us that there is no white, no black, no Punjabi, and no refugee. If there had been no religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in the war between white and black, and the rest would have fallen prey to enmity on the basis of cost and race.
In fact, religion provides moral training to human beings and makes them disciplined on the grounds that they have not been born with their own free will, but the Creator of the universe has sent them here and they have to live in this world in accordance with God's commands.
As a Muslim, I have a firm belief that Islam is a complete code of life and a true religion.
After having settled in London, for several years I used to call each relative daily in the morning to get to know their health, but despite this, the majority of them did not even call on a single occasion to inquire about us; then I realized that they weren't even welcoming our telephone call and I stopped calling them.
While living in France during the last two years, I got the same feeling.
I don't know why people expect only from us to call them.
The resolution against Iraq was passed in just a few hours and dispatching a 'peace' force to Darfur is not a problem at all.
Immediately condemning the Mumbai attacks and banning suspected organizations is an exercise of a few hours.
And about the place where death is dancing we are in the process of consultations.
O' the custodians of world peace, the life is disappearing here.
Does the end of this is not being awaited in reality?
So that any depressed cannot even think of using an extensively destructive weapon like the slingshot to get his right.
When a father is seen running with the dead body of his beloved child, then, too, don't you feel the waves of pain in any part of your heart?
If not, then you are not worthy of being regarded as a human being.
But in fact you are a symbol of shame for humanity.
It has been proven that for thousands of years this region has also been the country of the Israelis.
What these two nations should do is live together with love and fondness, but since the strings of their control are in the hands of Western and Arabic countries, that is why peace can never be established here without their will.
In fact, now Iran also wants to fight its proxy war from this region.
If Israeli attacks cease for the time being then it will recommence following some other another incident.
The BBC's country's interests are linked with its services to America and Israel and this is the reason that in the grab of 'enlightenment' they have emerged with a series of blogs to project 'Judaism,' and carrying out one-sided and 'blind' propaganda.
The BBC is merely completing 'formalities,' whereas its real intention and objective is only to gather sympathies!
I request the moderator to publish my comments so that we can get some idea about the remaining magnitude of the BBC's fact-loving aspect.
Thanks.
Don't know who wrote this story or how it came into being, but one thing is clear - that in every age, Draculas have been sucking the blood of innocent human beings,
wars have been taking place in every age, and blood has been flowing during all these times.
But it is a matter of surprise as to why the human being of the 21st century, who regards himself as very civilized, is silent upon the open massacres being committed in broad daylight,
why are they not feeling this that whatever is happening today is presenting the worst form of humanity.
The sad and tragic aspect is that what picture this shameful aspect of the civilized man will present to the man of the coming century.
Well-wisher, Sijjadul Husnain, Hyderabad Daccan.
These days the whole country, including Dera Ghazi Khan, is having winter rains.
In line with the weather a poem is being presented; enjoy the rain with this poem.
These rains too are because of you
If they rain, they become enjoyment
If they don't rain, they become contentment
Sometimes they arrive without any plan
Sometimes they come day and night
Sometimes they make noise and sometimes keep calm
These rains too are because of you
In the memory of someone on some night
An ash that was hidden
Sometimes so happened that it was put out
And sometimes burned itself with its own fire
Sometimes their sadness shows from every drop
These rains too are because of you
All our leaders are the category of people who run away with their briefcases; they have no concern if the country exists or not.
They have no concern whether the public sells toothpowder, or cleans the bells of temples with lemon peels.
Like our rulers, our media is also corrupt.
Its only and only objective is to extract money from the government and nothing else.
As far as the public is concerned, they are ignorant, and talking about the public is even the biggest ignorance
There occurred a surprising event yesterday afternoon.
The whole police are running here and there and not taking action on illegal parking.
Moreover, nypd traffic was not in the mood to check illegal parking, either.
It so happened that an aircraft of the US Air became a plane in reality and landed in the Hudson River.
The only information so far known is that the "terrorists" belonged to the species of goose.
Yesterday was perhaps the historic cold in New York.
The temperature never falls to this level.
My own jaw has started giving pain due to half an hour's walk outdoors.
Just imagine what would have happened to people who jumped out of the plane into the river.
The happy news is that all of them remained saved.
And the painful news is that in the time of this financial crisis, the company's plane sunk.
Looking at all this, I reached New Jersey using the West Side Highway; I even saw that south bound was closed, but why did I still do this?
Upon returning, I got trapped up in that rush.
Thank God that during my one-hour's trip, the rush had cleared to such an extent that I got the exit to 56th Street.
I did not take the first two exits due to long lines of traffic.
Mukki My Pakistan: Thank you and Eid greetings to you as well.
Omar: Of course believer women
Shagufta: Congragulationa and Eid Mubarak to you as well.
Sarah: I have sacrificed two chickens. Sacrifice is done and Jahanzaib has showed how it can be done.
There is no other way besides this.
At this farm the meat has to be prepared personally, including the skin removal.
Basam: DotNet may take time for rectification.
What happened at the Forum?
Linco
To fight with snow of blog look, use Firefox.
Duffer: Thanks, Eid greetings to you as well.
Sir, use Firefox.
The snow will disappear.
We have been considering the Sawati Taliban group as uncivilized, who were fed up with only female education.
They were demonstrating this unhappiness at one place or the other by demolishing schools or colleges for women.
But like many assumptions, this, too, has not been proven true; according to CNN, on the holy day of Monday, the Taliban blasted a boys school.
Sawat, Taliban demolish a boys school.
The girls schools were actually demolished first following a famous English proverb saying "ladies first"; we don't know why people are still bent upon calling the Taliban uncivilized, uncultured and barbarous.
Another allegation against the Taliban that also becomes clear from this is that the Taliban are not only against the education of girls is not correct.
But they are totally against education by the grace of God.
May Allah give these fighters more strength and
help them uproot the cruel government imposed upon us
Ameen.
So far, one-hundred and eighty-two schools have been demolished by the grace of God.
Among Muslims, the issues like entering into a marriage promise before birth, the tradition of marriage with the Quran in the name of grabbing property, as well as many scholars' point of view that a girl becomes an adult at the age of 8 years, were no less controversial than the news about marrying a girl with a frog that came from India.
See the picture of the bridegroom taken at the marriage.
This refreshed a girl's marriage with a dog some time back.
Look at that bridegroom, too.
There is a dearth of humanity in the twenty-first century, as well.
This is the age of the computer, and its intervention is getting higher in every walk of life.
Many people have reservations about this growing intervention of the computer, e.g. in financial affairs.
Where the use of credit card facilitates you, it also becomes a source of improving the grip of law enforcement agencies upon your private life
that now your whereabouts can be traced just through financial dealings, for example the use of credit card.
In the future, when the use of real currency will get minimized to a greater extent, its usefulness will increase.
In the same way, in the criminal world too, instead of taking the risk of bank burglary, the credit card information is stolen.
In the same way, building friendship is also being done through computer resources.
Social networking Web sites, e.g. Orkut, Facebook and Myspace, are rated first in terms of popularity.
But don't you feel that, as we get more and more under the influence of these social networks mentally, in the same way, we are practically getting more and more isolated from people.
In a similar manner, there are matchmaking Web sites in which your likes are matched with other peoples' likes and a list of compatible people is shown to you.
Can you live your life with another person exactly similar to you?
I cannot live, that is why a life partner is also called a better half.
This means that the flaws that exist in my personality, my spouse covers them.
Perhaps I got a lesser portion of acumen.
In my childhood, I used to accept as being true whatever a person of old age had said.
In the same way, I had full confidence that Dad knew the answer to every question in the world.
Because of this, I was ridiculed.
But only those things that were possible appeared true to me.
I used to feel great hesitation upon the need of telling lies.
In that age, too, I was at a loss due to this.
As such, I try to tell minimum lies.
Don't enter into a false promise with anyone by citing the name of Allah.
And I mention Insha' Allah only when I am praying for something to get done.
Rest Allah knows better what is in our hearts.
This is a disgusting issue that came into existence as a result of being away from religion.
In accordance with both our religion and the laws of Pakistan, innocent children should live with their mothers.
Their maintenance is the responsibility of the father, who can meet with them.
When children become adults, it is up to them to decide with whom they want to live.
You have rightly said that kith and kin are the real problems who teach inappropriate lessons.
In our society, if the wife or husband of a 50-55 year-old dies and he/she enters into a second marriage, then why is this not viewed to be a good practice?
In our neighborhood, a Pakistani uncle lives whose wife died ten, twelve years ago; after getting all his children married, he then himself married a widow, as a result of which all his children turned against him.
In my view, this is his religious right, what do you say?
We cannot bear that someone takes the place of our mother while we are alive; what type of approach is this?
Feudal thinking is heavily influencing our all actions.
The thought working behind it is that new successors to share the property of father will be produced and this development is opposed, otherwise the action of their father is appreciable and should be practiced.
In our society, restrictions with reference to relationships have created social evils.
The concept of marriage of widows and divorced is disappearing day by day.
These useless values and inappropriate traditions are putting the family system in disarray.
In my opinion, the children of this gentleman should think that after getting all the kids married, if he enters into a marriage with a widowed woman, then what harm has he done?
In this way, the widowed woman got support and the uncle found a housekeeper,
because his children would certainly have become busy with their respective individual lives and were not giving time to him.
Ignorance is the reason for this.
Tomorrow if their wives refused serving the old man then what will they do?
This is the result of pressure from society.
When people make a joke of the family for such an act, then the children start feeling embaressad at the father's second marriage.
Though they should fight with the circumstances saying that the action of their father was wholly in accordance with Islam.
This is a curse in our society of which we have completely become a victim during the past 40-50 years.
It is even acceptable to a wife that her husband may continue with the immoral activities, but she does not allow him to have another marriage.
If this were within her control, she would not have allowed her husband to marry, even after her death.
In addition to spoiling hers and her husband's afterlife, she is also becoming the cause of spreading corruption in society.
Repeating the name of Islam brings nothing; factually we like only those things that are in accordance with our customs and traditions.
For example, Wani, Kari, keeping the girls illiterate and gun bullet for the marriage of own choice.
As far your question is concerned, instead of bringing the widow to his home, if the gentleman had gone to the widow's home, the relatives would have become quiet after making some formal hue and cry (but this would have disturbed the stomachs of the widow's relatives).
In the Indo-Pak subcontinent, we accepted Islam centuries ago, but could not get rid of irrational beliefs till today and gave preference to customs and traditions upon religion.
Terming a man's second marriage as immoral, divorce a sign of shame, a divorced woman as an untouchable, love marriage as a sign of disrespect and a man marrying a woman of higher age as the cleverness of woman, is a result of this way of thinking.
As a result of blindly following the culture of Western nations, we regard Purdah and virtuousness as outdated concepts.
It was easier to accept Islam but it was very difficult to get rid of thoughts like this.
May Allah give us all the courage and boldness to do this.
Ameen.

Amir Taimur in his book "I am Taimur" writes that the life secret he learned in his life is that if the commander of an army stays at the front position, that army will never face defeat.
But here the situation is opposite.

And if someone from the public dies he is assassinated.

Today after Isha prayer, while I was coming back towards the shop, a man, sitting in a car, signaled by raising his hand towards me to get my attention.
I thought perhaps this man has forgotten the way or wants to ask something; I stopped and saw his whole family sitting in the car.
He asked whether I could fully understand Arabic; I said no problem tell me the issue.
He started saying that I came from Riyadh to Medina and someone picked my pocket and so could you please help me; I said for him to excuse me because a similar incident had already happened to me when I gave 20 Riyals to a person to buy petrol with this money and get back to Riyadh, but he, after going a little distance, started doing the same thing.
I felt considerably annoyed, scolded him and he then ran away when I gave him a threat of police.
Now we Muslims have reached a position where we are using the car with family for begging purposes and make a minimum of two, three-thousand on a daily basis.
There exists a clear saying of the Holy Prophet (SAWS) that the upper hand is better than the lower one; because the lower hand is that of a taker and the upper hand is that of a giver.
May Allah bless us with His kindness and make us true Muslims. (Ameen)

The wife of the famous singer, Adnan Sami's wife, reached a police station in Mumbai and blamed him for violence,
the Police Station has advised her to seek the advice of the court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Galadari has lodged a complaint against her husband Adnan Sami that he consistently commits violence
and inhuman treatment against her.
Since this has crossed the limit of her tolerance, therefore, a court case should be registered against Adnan Sami.
Instead of registering the case, the police advised her to consult the court, because this case is outside its jurisdiction.
Do you think the allegations of Adnan Sami's wife are correct?
Is this allegation not an Indian effort to defame Adnan Sami?
Give your opinion about this.
Adam Sanghir, Mehr.
As far as allegations are concerned, anyone can blame the others.
Nothing is superior to respect
Whatever the relationship may be between Adnan Sami and his present wife, Adnan Sami left a respectable life and went to India to earn money, and now the same popularity has become a problem for him.
This is the result of his own mistakes.
Washington...
According to the higher American officials, President Obama will adopt a hard-line approach towards Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
In the new American policy about Afghanistan, war has been accorded preference over the development.
According to the officials, Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achieving American targets in Afghanistan, because corruption prevails in the government, the drugs business has increased, and the Taliban are gaining strength.
According to American officials, those from the American administration who are mounting pressure on Hamid Karzai for increased measures include Vice President Joe Biden and President Obama's envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke.
According to them, this policy has come up after the departure of President Bush, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai every two weeks to emphasize the American role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and its civic institutions.
The officials said that the Obama administration will work with provincial leaders as a substitute for the central government.
The officials said they would press Hamid Karzai to increase the fight against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing new elections this year and this is not yet clear whether Obama and his companions would support him for the presidency or not.
Is this statement of American officials a signal of change in American policy towards Afghanistan?
Is Hamid Karzai's rule going to end?

Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan by 2-1 in the three, one-day match series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
In the first one-day match Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka, however, in the next two matches Sri Lanka was successful.
In the third one-day match, the performance of national cricket team remained highly ineffective; the national team in response to Sri Lanka's 309 runs was all out for 75 runs in 23 overs and thus had to face a humiliating defeat.
The outcome of the series proves that there is no consistency in the performance of the national team.
Despite home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated; in your opinion, what are the reasons for this?
To what aspects of the game, those at the helms of affairs need to pay more attention?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?

Malik Babar Hussain, Jeddah, it is a matter of great regret that in this modern age, too, these sorts of ignorant rituals are continuing; these big landholders, landlords and feudal lords with their tyrannical rule target the innocent people; who will call them Muslims?

When will justice from the court come?
The Sri Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan to play a one-day international series.
Despite Pak-India tensions, a foreign cricket team's visit to Pakistan is a welcome matter.
After reaching Karachi Airport, the Sri Lankan team was accorded a warm welcome.
Two one-day matches between Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be played in Karachi, whereas the third one-day will be held in Lahore.
High claims about bowling, batting and fielding are being advanced from both the teams.
If Sri Lankans are proud of their spinners, Pakistan trusts its fast bowling.
According to the captain of the Sri Lankan cricket team, Mahela Jayawardene, no single player but the whole Pakistani team is dangerous.
Muralitharan and Mandis will be the trump cards, whereas according to the Pakistani captain, the competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik said that they have played Muralitharan and would tackle Mandis as well; they have drawn up a secret game plan which they would demonstrate in the ground.
Will the series be interesting and exciting as per the Pak Sri Lanka claims?
Who will have the upper hand in the series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka?

Gulfam, London. You publish statements of your interest and you also give preference to them; we wish that you also write some truth.

What to say of Mukherji, he tries to be in the news by changing statements.
The British Foreign Minister, David Miliband has said that terrorism shall be eliminated with the solution of the Kashmir issue, and the Government of Pakistan shall be able to deal effectively with the dangers developing on its borders.
Remember that before this, the newly-elected American President Barack Obama also gave a similar statement about the Kashmir issue.
The British Foreign Minister expressed in a discussion with the media in Mumbai and in an article he wrote that the idea about the fight against terrorism is wrong. It was the policy of President Bush to kill people in the name of self-defense.
David Miliband has said that Pakistan should not demonstrate any leniency towards the terrorist groups.
Because of the emphasis by the big powers for the need of a solution to the Kashmir issue, is India not trying to divert attention from the issue by creating tension in the region?
Is Mumbai Terrorism not a part of this strategy?
Does India intend to escape the process of broad negotiations by making the terrorism a basis?
Give your opinion.
Malik Yousaf, Dubai.
All this has been done by these people; Kashmiris have been fighting the war of independence for the last 60 years.
No one has helped them, and now, when they have been trapped up in the war of extremism and terrorism, reconciliation talks have commenced.
First they committed mass murders of Muslims and now are on the lookout for a compromise.
Anyhow, Pakistan must understand their dual policy.
Asad Khan, London
India is trying to create such a situation so as to get the world attention diverted from Kashmir.
But Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now the British government also understands this. That's why India, by defaming Pakistan in the name of terrorism, is trying to ignore the Kashmir occupation
and is hesitant to talk to Pakistan on this issue.
Usman Aftab
In my opinion, the big powers don't want to bring complete damage to Pakistan
but in order to bring it under control, they are thinking of some measures; they know that Pakistan is a nuclear power.
They want to create the situation of a revolution here.
The foreign countries are thinking that backing Pakistan into a corner may result in some political and geographical difficulties; they want to help Pakistan side-by-side, achieving their own objectives.

Ras al-Khaima, these statements are being exchanged due to American mischief; America's mind has become out of order, but the situation with India is not different, either; let it go for the attack and see who stands where.
Israel is launching attacks on Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it; India too wants to follow Israel to do the same.
Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani has said that the newly-elected American Vice President, Joe Biden, played an important role in ex-president Musharraf, leaving his army chief post and the reinstatement of a lame democracy and, therefore, the Government of Pakistan has awarded him with Sitara-e-Imtiaz.
The credit for Musharraf leaving his army chief post and the reinstatement of democracy should not go to any political party. The parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All the decisions will be taken in the parliament.

The American President, George W Bush, in his farewell press conference, advising the newly elected President Barack Obama, said that he made many mistakes during the period of his presidency and Barack Obama should do whatever he deems appropriate.
As a President, I took steps in accordance with the circumstances and in the light of the American constitution and law, and preferred the American interests upon my own popularity.
He said that even today the enemies of America are planning to attack America; the greatest challenge for Barack Obama will be to stop these attacks.
He said that the greatest disappointment for me was that no weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq and the greatest mistake was my declaration about the completion of the mission in Iraq.
While addressing his last press conference in the White House, the American President said that this is his last press conference and he wanted to thank all the journalists and other friends who participated in that conference.

At the end of the first day's play in the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy match between PIA and Habib Bank, Shahid Afridi, an all-rounder cricketer, entered into a conflict with a spectator.
At the UBL ground, the moment Shahid Afridi came out of the drawing room after playing the match, a large number of spectators gathered around him.
At one moment, a spectator held Shahid Afridi's hand and requested him to have a photograph with him at which Shahid Afridi, while pushing him away, said he could take the photograph the next day; however, upon the spectator's insistence, Shahid Afridi slapped in aggression and before they could have started intense fighting with each other, the people present there hushed them up.
After this, Shahid Afridi said that it was unnecessarily being made an issue; at that time he was in a hurry for the prayers.
He would however apologize to that spectator.

The Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, has once again alleged that Pakistan is creating a war-like situation
and Pakistan uses terrorism as a state policy.
Addressing the chief ministers conference in New Delhi, Manmohan Singh said that terrorists are being backed by neighboring countries, particularly Pakistan
and for the Mumbai attacks, the terrorists adopted a sea route and they remained safe from the Indian Coast Guard.
The Indian Prime Minister said that the Mumbai attacks in November were carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba.
He further said that the terrorists are using new techniques and the latest telecommunication systems; they will have to increase security along the control line, where cross border activities take place. According to him, terrorism in any form would not be accepted and this was their policy.
How do you see this allegation from the Indian Prime Minister?
Is the Indian impatience not an indication of its internal chaos and separatist movements?
On whose backing has India kept on adopting an intimidating attitude?

Israeli air strikes on Gaza are continuing, and so far hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
An important political leader of Hamas, Nazarian, has been killed along with his wife and children.
On the other hand, a meeting of the Security Council has concluded without taking any decision.
In the meeting, the resolution for condemning Israel, presented by Libya and other Arab countries is facing American opposition.
The air strikes by Israeli plans on the civilian Palestinian population have continued for the last several days.
The whole world began crying over the Mumbai attacks, but America and Britain have been unable to see the mass bloodshed as a result of the Israeli strikes.
Why are the important countries of the Muslim Ummah silent?
What would you like to say about these double standards of the world community?
Zubair Khan, Karachi.
This is a highly heartbreaking incident that Israelis are committing the mass murder of Palestinians; here in Kashmir the situation is not different, but the Security Council does not pay any heed to it.
All the organizations currently present in Palestine and Kashmir should keep on fighting till their independence and by creating unity among themselves continue to fight all types of aggressions; their martyrdom will one day come up with flying colors with the grace of God.
In the whole lengths and breadths of Pakistan, the shortage of gas and electricity has reached an alarming situation.
On the other hand, effective from 01 January, gas prices have been raised up by 8 percent on average, whereas in some cities of the country, the non-availability of petrol has become a cause of intense suffering for the public.
In Pakistan's industrial and commercial sectors, intense reaction, uproars and violent demonstrations are continuing against the long electricity load-shedding and gas crises.
The industrialists have given an ultimatum for the closure of factories.
In Karachi, eight to ten hours of load-shedding is causing restlessness among the people.
Industrial life has almost come to a standstill.
In this connection, the government departments are giving their point of view by blaming each other.
Are the talks to increase gas and electricity prices not a joke with the public?
Why is attention not being paid towards the solution of problems?
Does the government not watching the wheel of the country's progress getting jammed?
What sorts of immediate measures would you suggest to overcome this crises?
Give your opinion.
Saeed, New York
In my view, the real issue is that the majority of our nation is uneducated; they don't know where their money is going; the government is interested in discharging its responsibilities by imposing taxes; the electricity and gas shortage will continue to exist in the same way.
Because all are aware of the character of those who have been elected by the public.
Imran Khokhar, Medina Munnawra. I want to say that "a bad cat deserves a bad rat."
I am surprised that one who raised the slogan for the government for the people is upsetting the people.
The non-availability of electricity, gas and petrol has become painful.
The government has no control over the institutions.
The law and order situation is worsening day by day. May Allah bless this country with His kindness.
The new year has commenced.
The last year was of demonstrations and political upheavals; it will also be remembered because of terrorism.
President Musharraf's isolation from power and the end of President Bush's eight-year rule; shoe-throwing on Bush and the establishment of the democratic government in Pakistan, natural calamities, earthquake in Balochistan and world-over financial crises and recession.
Now the new year is arriving. How do you see the upcoming year?
In your opinion, what change will the geographic and political situation bring; what will be the strategy of Obama?
Is there any hope of advancement for the elimination of terrorism?
Will the judicial crises end in Pakistan?
What will be the direction of Pak-India relations?
Is there the possibility of surgical strikes or a full-fledged war?
What expectations do you have for the new year?

Shaheed Benazir Bhutto's first-death anniversary is being celebrated. She was martyred on 27 December 2007 after an election meeting at Liaquat Bagh in Rawalpindi.
Benazir is not among us today; she was an intellectual, a politician and internationally-recognized figure; in the realm of national politics she held a unique place.
Even after passing a year, the mystery of her martyrdom has not been resolved until today.
Her efforts for the establishment of democracy and government in Pakistan have not gone fruitless.
Today, there exists a democratic government in Pakistan with her husband, Asif Zardari, holding the position of President.
How do you view the role of Shaheed Benazir Bhutto in Pakistan's politics?
Whose hand can be behind her martyrdom?
She has recently been given the International Award for Human Rights. What would you say about her political and democratic services?
After 8 years of rule over America, President Bush has left the White House and shifted to the Presidential camp office in Camp David so that the White House can be prepared after refurbishment in accordance with new President Barack Obama's desire.
During 8 years of the Bush presidency, the historic attack on and destruction of the World Trade Center in America, the strike on the Pentagon and then by initiating military action against Afghanistan and Iraq in the name of the Global War on Terror and dragging in several countries' armed forces in this war and the extensive use of America's resources in this war, are the memorable examples of Bush's reign.
With this war, America itself had to face history's worst economic and financial crises.
In your opinion, what has the world gained and lost from this war?
Were President Bush's policies successful?
What is your opinion about President Bush's rule?
The Indian Government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was to play three tests, five one-day matches and one Twenty20 match in Pakistan.
The Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board said while talking to Jeo News that the Board had requested permission for Pakistan visit from the government, but due to the existing stressful situation between the two countries, this visit is not possible.
Is the Indian government stand to cancel the cricket team's visit on the basis of current political scenario a correct action, and should the game not be treated separately from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision not harmful to cricket?
When the England cricket team, despite the bad security situation in India continued its visit, then why can't the Indian team visit Pakistan?
What is your opinion about this?
Salman, Karachi.
Those who feel proud of visiting India
and make their films or videos over there, should now open their eyes to see how much respect the people of India have for them.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami in which he said that he was not a Pakistani, and he had British nationality.
Adnan Sami should come to Pakistan as soon as possible, because there, too, he was not worthy of respect.
Farid Ahmad.

After the Mumbai attack, the attitude of Indians has changed.
Jagjit Singh has expressed his reaction by saying that he hates Pakistan and the Pakistanis.
It should be known that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhosle; how can he be a bad singer now; Adnan Sami should live in India there is no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam
Karachi. About Jagjit Singh's statement I shall only say that he changes his color like lizard
and issues statements depending on the situation; open your eyes, Pakistanis, to see how much respect there is for you in India; try to understand the Hindu mindset.
After the Mumbai attacks, their hateful statements have increased, and now they are also ejecting poison against Adnan Sami.
According to a foreign news agency, the American President Bush while on his farewell visit to Iraq was accompanied by the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri-al-Maliki during a press conference in the latter's office, where the situation turned ridiculous when an Iraqi journalist, addressing the President Bush said "O' dog! This is a farewell kiss."
After this, the journalist took off one of his shoes and threw it at Bush; before the shoe could have touched, President Bush very skillfully bowed his head down to save himself.
The second shoe hit the American flag.
The security personnel, dragging the journalist along, took him away from the scene.
President Bush on this occasion said that he didn't know why he did so; the shoe was of size 10; he is not worried.
In your opinion, does this act of the journalist not reflect an angry reaction on behalf of the Iraqi nation against President Bush?
What would you say about this incident?
In the aftermath of the terrorist incident in Mumbai, the tension between India and Pakistan became a severe time when fighter aircrafts of the Indian Air Force violated the airspace of Pakistan in Kashmir and Lahore sectors.
The response of the Pakistan Air Force forced the Indian aircrafts to go back.
According to the sources, both the Indian aircrafts were equipped with weapons and explosives.
In the current circumstances, this was the first incident of this kind.
According to the Pakistan Air Force, it is fully prepared to defend the country.
According to Information Minister, Sherry Rehman, Indian authorities have accepted that violation of the airspace did take place; however, it was due to a mistake.
The defense sources in Pakistan have termed this as an incident of grave concern.
In your opinion, is India really determined to launch an air attack against Pakistan?
Is the Indian point of view that this violation was the result of a mistake correct, or the purpose of this was to assess the capability of the Pak Air Force?
Will this incident not be the cause of furthering tensions between the two countries?

This is true the she was martyred, but we have to remember also that she committed the bloodshed of many innocent people in Karachi for which she used to feel proud of by saying that Naseerullah Babar has done a very good job,
but later on she got totally changed.
But it is also true that she ignored the senior workers of her party and selected her son as the party representative; what kind of democracy is this?
The panel of the Security Council of the United Nations has added the names of three Pakistani nationals including Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, and five organizations including Jamaat-ud-Dawa on the list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names have been approved to be included in the list of terrorists by Al Qaeda and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council, include the Amir of Jamaat-ud-Dawa Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the operations chief of defunct Lashkar-e-Tayyiba Zaki Rahman Lakhvi and the chief of finance department Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
In addition to this, the name of a Saudi citizen, Mahmoud Ahmad Bazeek, is also included in the list of terrorists.
Among these organizations are Jamaat-ud-Dawa, Pasban-e-Kashmir, Al Rasheed Trust and Al Akhtar Trust International.
The member countries will forthwith freeze all assets of these persons and organizations; there will be a ban on their travel and they will be arrested.
They will have to face litigations.
Are these sanctions not under the influence of Indian propaganda?
Why is India, without any proof, blaming these organizations for the Mumbai attacks?
Are there no terrorist organizations in India?

The Eid festival is a symbol of happiness and enjoyment and on Eid ul Adha, the believers of one God, following the tradition of Ibrahim offer animal sacrifices.
In this turbulent age, when the inflation is at its peak and political conditions are aggravated, regardless of all this, both poor and rich prepare for Eid according to their financial capacity and greet their relatives in different ways.
We, too, are providing you an opportunity through blog to send brief messages of Eid greetings to your beloved ones.
You can also congratulate, through poetic stanzas, appropriate for Eid.
Murtaza Jilani.
Karachi. Our rulers should understand that the people against whom they are carrying out operations on are those who love Pakistan; they are suffering from all types of aggressions but still love Pakistan.
They will fight shoulder-to-shoulder with Pakistan if there occurred a war;
when their love will be realized. Nothing would be achieved only with the politics of agitation; in my opinion, there is a possibility of a decisive war between both so that they get satisfied.
