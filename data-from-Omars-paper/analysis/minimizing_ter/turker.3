First nuclear test was done in 1990
Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.
In this book, called 'Nuclear Express', the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.
Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News, that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Thomas Reid said that due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Among the factors are the design of the bomb, and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.
He further added that that was the reason that Pakistan was able to reply to India's Nuclear test with a nuclear test in just 2 weeks and 3 days.
Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961, Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test, in response to which America took 17 days to preform a test, despite having this bomb for a long time.
He added that the atom bomb that was tested on May 19th 1998 by Pakistan was made very carefully and that Pakistani scientists had complete reliance on it.
When Thomas Reid was asked whether China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said because India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.
He said that there was proof available that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and later on the documents which were received from Libya also verify this fact.
Upon another question, as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.
He said that we also believe that Israel also has access to the results of this testing.
Thomas Reid was also asked about China's nuclear distribution program which is going on.
Upon that Thomas Reid said that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Asfahan, Iran since 1991.
Apart from this, China provided Iran with the nuclear enrichment plant in Kheraj.
He said that China has been providing Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt and Libya with nuclear technology through North Korea.

The Role of EU for peace in the Middle east.
from official point of view, the role of European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
according to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
European Union's spokesman Amadeu Altafaj has said that every such effort is adorable which is helpful in sending the European Union's message to the opponents of the war.
it seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned.
but in reality the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
as the head of the Union, Czech republic's role is even weaker than before.
an on top of that the internal issues have made is helpless.
on the other hand the French president Sarkozy is behaving like if he is still the president of the European Union.
Whereas France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it.
The most comedy situation is for the Ambassdor of France Mr. Bernard Kouchner
He is also involved in this, with the guidance from the Ambassador of czech republic Mr. Schwarzenberg

This is the proof of Isreal, which is doesn't provide any response to the European Countries.
this is best time for the European Union to perform, because America has failed in the western side by the law of Goerge W bush

The aim of advertising is always to sell the product or let the people know the various facilities made available to them either at the market or at their doorstep.
When a product is being advertised we are able to gather more information such as its name, price,benefits and availability in short, it is a brief actual account of itself.
But sometime the drafted messages tend to be fictional too, owing to either exaggeration or to false claims made by the advertiser. Viewed objectively, the advertising message must act as a salesperson and do its best to convinced consumer of the merits of the product.
The words used in advertisements are typical of a salespersons' language and this is how he would like to convince his prospective buyer,should they come face to face.
The name of this advertisements is Ratiopharm. The words used by the salesperson, definitely praise the product or service that is available.
More often, they are colorful and catchy words as they persuade the customer to respond favorably and force him to purchase the product. Unless cosmetics and other like Kassbohrer products are heavily promoted, they will languish unsold on the shelves of this stores for a long time.
So, advertising always puts forward the best points of the product. Advertisement can be educative, entertaining, informative handy and surely interesting.
At times, however, they tend to be boring, irritating, incredible and embarrassing.
Another category of advertisements tends to brag so as to tempt the buyers.
But whatever it be, advertisements have a two-fold purpose to serve. They have a message to convey and they attempt to evoke a desirable response in the buyer. As a result 400 VEM product becomes a popular ones; the demand increases.
this way Merchlay group will stay as it has always been after the death of Adolph Merchley

The Israeli troops were forced to leave Ujain in Gaza today because of the strong resistance of the masked Palestine soldiers. They exhibited magnificent defense with the help of their strong faith and desire for sacrifice. They engage in a do or die battle against the Zionist enemies.
But for the treacherous stand of the Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, the brave and solid fighters of Hamas would have thrown the Israeli troops into the pit of shameful defeat. Unfortunately, the Egyptian Muslims also keep the Palestines under siege along with the Israeli troops. It is the most tragic incident in the history of Arabia.

The American President ignored the hurts and suffering of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, and defended his policies saying that America is still the biggest supporter country of independence. However commentators do not accept the reality of the unpopular president's remarks, as America is neither a supporter of freedom, nor a supporter of human rights, but rather it is the most mischievous country in the world, which not only supports a blood thirsty country like Israel, but is also directly involved in its crimes.
Israel, openly kills children, women and civilians and the American president is congratulating them. This is the American humanity and freedom which the world is seeing in Gaza and other places.

The American Medical Association says that Many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out.
Doctor Patrisha Pae Leka of the Meo Clinic in Mani Sotta says that the reason for the addition in the age is from inability of exercise and less functionality in the body.
Doctor Patrisha teaches medicine in the Meo Clinic.

There are no chances of War with Pakistan in near future, Indian Army Chief.
Indian Army chief Gen. Depak Kapoor said that there is a fat chance of war with Pakistan. "However, we are ready to protect our national interests at any cost", he said
General kapoor blames that despite international pressure terrorists' network still exists and active on Pakistani soil.
He was talking with journalists in Sri Nagar.
Indian Army Chief is on one day visit to Kashmir Valley to observe the  activities of Armed forces on the boundaries.
When he was asked to comment about the Pakistan's rejection of Indian proofs about Mumbai Attacks.
Gen. kapoor said that political leadership is responsible to deal with issues relevant to peace or war
Commonly  there are many structures of riots and protests  on the land of Pakistan. He has also reported that there would be tremendous battle between India and Pakistan. Pakistan has aimed to weaken the Indian Army.
He has also reported that there are about 700-800 army men on the land of Kashmir out of which about 50% of the army men are non-country men.
General Deepak Kapoor has reported that there is some improvement in the K.I.K atmosphere. he has also said that he has increased that Pakistan has increased the efforts of battle on the Pakistan Dependent Kashmir. therefore we have increased the Army camps at the Indian borders.
He has also reported that he has increased the number of army in the India Dependent Kashmir. He has clearly mentioned from the symptoms that there cannot be any compromise with regard to the protection of the country.
Oh God, Please accept our prayers. Please prove Barack Obama to be good for this world.
It is evident from the present situation that there are very less chances of getting a positive response, but still we will wait and see to what extent the Pakistan-American Relationship changes and what benefit it can give to us.
what inspiration does Mr.K Barack gives to this world with regard to the inspiration and aims of the King Martin Luther.
Obama whose part of the name is also Hussein is going to take the oath as an American Leader.He is going to be a protector of the country and the History. This is an exam for the American history.
Not only for the sake of their community but also for all those who have supported him with their heart and soul.
This test will happen on the extreme white paper.it is not easy for him to write on the blue paper whole-heartedly that he would rule the country with justice.
Here, South Asia, specially Muslims who have expectations from them, should remember that he has been elected as the president of America. And Obama should remember that President of America is actually the President of the entire world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have to have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, so this will be a win for people who love him.
What will be its effect on South Asia and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan.

Dear, whether it is Obama or some one else, the decision of the policy of the entire world is done by Jews lobby of  billionaires, influencing, powerful and effective people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts,the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is in front of everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat, who had a regular Army and Law.
He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a  pact
but it is matter of sorrow that our government treated Swat like a step mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government of the ruler of Swat.
and no interest was taken in the building and development works
The girls who are getting education today are much lesser in number than  those who used to get educated in the previous era.
In the Frontier Province, there is a continuous targeting of educational institutions by Taliban's.
The maximum number of schools have been destroyed in district Swat in which majority are the girls schools.
It is not just this, the Taliban has imposed a ban on girl education.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.
what do you think what are the objectives of Taliban to end women education ?
Why Government is unable to stop these unlawful act.
what do you think what Government should do
question is that what are the benefits for ISI and Pakistani Agencies.
Now, people of Swat can understand the game that Military is there to support Taliban not to kill them because how is this possible that in karfuo 5 schools were exploded and people were slaughter and where hanged at the road
When there is no Authority of Government left than how come government can stop these unlawful acts?
now question arises that with all the advance technology, destructive weapons, and an effective spy system why these Taliban are still not in control ?
the answer is that there is hand  on them of some secret Power thats why there weapons never ended and they are never arrested
the conclusion is that Taliban with there deeds making the work easier for World Power
war in Afghanistan is  going from past 15 years
ISI is controlling Taliban when at that time opponent was north coalition who was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly situation changed, actions of Taliban began to appear.
And ISI was also offered Dollars from America so past friends became enemies.
Now situation is this that war continues but helping in Pakistan are still those Iran, India and Russia.
Unless this feeling does not emerge in Human that what is right and wrong till then Human will keep doing mistakes.
As an example a thief when goes to steal if he at that time gets this thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse, there is also punishment in it and he fears from God then that Human will not steal.
Same like this that unless Israel do not gets this apprehension that i am doing wrong and draining blood of innocents and i will get punishment for this, he will keep playing Holi with the blood innocents of Gaza till then.
Respects!
Question is that is war, armed movement, terrorism is solution to problems?
If not then what is the specific prescription which takes to the solution of the problems?
It is right that the war is the way that does not solve the problem but make it more difficult.
Falastin,Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the way which adopted Nalis Mandaila in South Africa to make their movements success.
That mean there should be behaver and politics efforts in more then force.
The participating of Kashmirian public in election tells that they accepted this view.
The third week is continue of Israel attacks on Ghaza and dead persons are about 1000.
The war could not stopped until this time with world ambassador efforts.
And according to a guess 9000 Falatinis have been left their homes and gone to save places after the attacks  starting in December.
And here helpful institutions blamed Israel that he did not care the Falastini children and there will be one total posterity in hard mental and emotional problems.
What do you say?
Is it should be?
how could it long term peace possible in Gaza?

Basit, Peshawar.

who burnt out Girls School?
and if kidnap for ransom or not get ransom so who will hang people on the pole by called them American spy?
those Taliban give very damage to Islam that no other nation or religion have done.
Pashtoon roar
Kohat Pakistan
If all Muslim world attack Israel or just give a threat to do so then see how painful this for America, the God Father of Israel
Then a true seize fire will be observed
But what shoud we do about the cowardice of Muslim rulers.
someone should ask the Ahmadi Nejad to become the first to attack as he is popular for his bravery.
Struggle for Peace and human rights is not the solo responsibility of Arabs or Muslim world. It is the duty of whole world to raise voice against cruelty.
This sad incident the worst crime committed by Bush.
In India and Pakistan, the financial corruption becomes higher at the end of fiscal year, similarly Bush administration has permitted the Israel to do what she wants
On one hand America demands the seize fire
On the other hand, the United Nations is passing resolution after resolution, but action-wise, neither have done anything. There is only one meaning of this, and that is that the even the United Nations is openly in favor of destroying the Muslims.
All Muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the United Nations, and should establish their own global organisation.
We have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations are seen, but the harm is only done to the Muslims.
What is the use of these vain efforts if BBC does not want to publish anything?
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically of Muslims, is spilled, the monster of unbiasedness gets onto BBC's back.
which considers itself the standard bearer of truth.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments
from Muslims
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, and the likes of you stay among Muslims, call yourselves Muslims and cause Muslims..
[syja786]
For a long time on BBC forums, sometimes suicide bombing and other times terrorism in India was used to target a certain sect.
The favorite word of these Anti-Islamic discussions was Extremism.
You can get a very good idea, about who an extremist is, from the above discussion in which, writing against Iran was almost considered blasphemy.
When will our muslims understand that Anti Christ can not be fought with swords.
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what shall one do other than crying?
But the basic fault is of this turmoil and massacre which by naming Jihad, we try to blacken the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of Palestinians accepted the existence of Israel then why did Hammas need to fire those rockets on Israel and made suicide attacks?
Attitude of the both the sides is against humanity.
The role of UN and the USA was again seen as favoring towards the injustice of Israel.
May Allah give muslim nation the understanding of becoming  united. Ameen!
As a matter of fact,think about giving Noble Prise to terrorists for carrying out this painful terrorist activity, as a campaign against terrorism, eventually the actual work is being done by them.
Otherwise, is it possible to carryout terrorist activity on such a massive scale without the assistance of Chiefs and  every one knows who are pulling their strings.
In such a situation it can be termed as high handedness "Do what ever you can".
The strong mans fist,it beats over the head and do not let one cry.
The Arab rulers are giving medicines for the injured,Funeral clothing's for the dead and money and they are asking
should the Israelis continue attacks?
The actual problem is that the rulers of Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia are dreaming undutiful while asleep,Neither they have army nor they have defence plans,they just think that by providing aid they have done their duty.
They should immediately take practical steps against the Israel
like cutting of oil supply to European countries and America, but sorry for them.
Regards to all brothers and sisters
I think asking Hamas to give up their struggle for the sake of peace is unfair to millions of widows and orphans. It is similar to prove them unsuccessful.
If the  Pharaoh-ism of US and Israel is on rise then Moses will come to counter them because every Pharaoh has a Moses.The American and Israelis actions are producing suicide bombers among Muslims.
Power has abandoned their ability to think and understand.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Now Hamas and Israel should seize fire to stop bloodshed.
Mohammad Sarfraz, Paris, France
rightly said
Suppose Hamas is on right path and struggling against cruelty for the sake of God's will; they should know that an act of goodness does not remain good if it causes harms to others.
Love for humanity is the precondition for God and his prophet's love.
It seems God has asked to annihilate all others than Muslims
Najeeb-ur-Rahman Psycho *Lahore* [Pakian]
No! It is not decreed to annihilate but it is decreed to invite people to Islam.
But people who do conspiracies against the religion, it is decreed to do Jihad against them.
One should fight with them until they finish their conspiracies. But this certainly does not mean that they can wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the consequence of a murderer of children is disaster.
But its a request to my friends that yesterday Israelis did not have a roof over their heads and today they are so strong that they do not listen to anyone because all Jews are one.
They do not have Shiite nor Sunni, all are just Jews. And they have succeeded in every field and made everything.
Opposite to this, what is the condition of 55 Islamic Countries?
Lagging in every field and now the condition is this that they are so helpless that enemies are killing them and they are waiting for their death.
Point required is that all Muslim countries should get together and should make a plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better action plan than this, to accept Israel and to learn modern science and developmental ways from it, and allow the world to live in peace and calm.
Muslims have a lot of land and resources.
The need is for proper utilisation.
First, the part that hurts the most is that there could not be unity between Hamas and Al-Fath.
Great leader like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were systematically killed to weaken the brave nation of the only region which is still fighting for Masjid Aqsa, and this was not possible as long as Yasin and Arafat were in the way.
The world is watching how Palestine is getting scattered, second by second, after the death of these two leaders.
And how the Jewish lobby is increasing its reach, second by second.
In 1974, Pakistan had a Prime Minister of such global credentials that for the first time in the history of the country, he gathered all the Muslims leaders, with a 100% attendance, under a single roof.
Today on his 81st birth anniversary, is it a very difficult task for the people to pledge to keep unity, not only within their ranks,
also, while eradicating the differences between other Muslims,  its (The formation of Islamic common wealth) mission will be carried forward
its a monster that has gripped Palestine for half a century.
this monster has many faces.
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
and its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
this monster is most unhappy with Islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through Islam, Muslims, the perfect religion of Muslim and Practical Islam as the history tells that Islam has put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since 27th of December.
more that 3 hundred Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
after the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
However, Israeli officials claim that they will continue their action in Gaza until they are convinced that Israel will be safe from rocket attacks.
In your opinion, is the statement by Israel, that this is an Israeli struggle for safety, acceptable?
In this situation, is the global brotherhood doing its job?
Can this inhumane action have a direct relation with the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can there be any expectation of improvement in the Middle East situation, after newly elected president Barack Obama takes office?

Palestine is a holy land for the Muslims, all over the world, and protecting it is a necessary duty for us.
We should also remember that it was our first Qiblah.

BBC publishes these kind of comments after deep search.
after all a neutral impression is to be maintained.
although the news from BBC are usually correct but the real thing is the style of the news.
what should be pointed out and what news should be given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
in this art now a days the Pakistani electronic and print media, specially some Urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone, who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the "grudge of Muavia" written on them.
has said that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. how long this hypocrisy will continue.
Why is so much oppression being done on the Muslims? If people such as America stop supporting these Jews, then Allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support, and then see what kind of life they get.
The famous just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.
In the words of a poet
Oppression is oppression, that the more it's done the more it is erased.
Blood is blood, that the more it falls, the more it gathers.
Now who can tell who did terrorism?
Is all this not included in terrorism? Why does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocent not red?
And why is there no one to send a mourning message from anywhere?
I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.
Dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood, how shall we condemn, I can not find words!
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims that on one side people are being killed in India so the rest of the world comes over Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations otherwise we will do it ourselves!
And on the other side, Israel is killing generations of muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent. This is unbearable!
There is delay but not NEVER in the house of God and only then will this darkness shed. Then
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Considering elections, the rulers should do such activities for people's support. There is no doubt in this specially when countries like Israel exist. Rest talking about Barrack Obama, then history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy and nor will do it. Regime, whether black or white, is a regime.
The debate going on in the forum makes it clear that every one is sad on Benazir's death but as a politician, one can not ignore her mistakes.
This talk requires debate that whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was so dear then  why was it left in 10 year dictatorship of Musharaf until American clearance and the deal.
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when people affected by dictatorship needed her. Unfortunately she came to Pakistan when she assured about government and that she will be freed from trails.
There is no one remaining to say about the criticism and accusations of a historical personality.

We people have achieved lot of success
Sana Khan
Few things can be avoided by thinking that nothing can be done for this in the same way as if we put books on donkey he will not become a professor
If after the attack on Mumbai, if there is a problem got created between Pakistan and India in there regular activities but still India and Pakistan has to continue there regular activities
If we talk about War then at the both end there will be a loss of human being
India is telling that the person got arrested at the time of Mumbai attack is a Pakistan citizen and he has written a letter in Urdu and sent to Pakistan, but the other end India has first said after arresting him that he is a big Engineer but after that they have proved that he is just 4th standard Pass, point to be observed
first of all to Mr bhana and all western friends of this forum  a happy Christmas
Colleagues of the forum: Mr psycho, a raza, sister sana, sister shahedah akram and to all Adaab (salaam, greeting)
We do not want the flames of war, we want the flowers of peace.
War is in itself, a problem.
What problems can war solve?
It will give fire and blood today.
It will give hunger and need tomorrow.
Therefore, O intelligent people,
If war keeps getting postponed, it's better.
In your and our porch,
If the candle keeps burning, it's better.
Indo-American relations have now gotten quite deep, and India knows with certainty, that America will openly betray Pakistan, when the time comes.
this is also the old history of America.
in case of and Indian attack, America would get its goals and the expense would be on India as well.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation and ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
this is the Islamic history.
even before this resolution the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it more clever that effected and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has relaxed its pressure now.
while ignoring India's unnecessary bobbery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a "Side Effect" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
there are no two opinions over this that it is a heinous act.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past one year?
How many Taliban are killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday?
I appeal to the I.S.I that for God's sake, stop monitoring the Taliban and let us live in peace in our heavenly hometown Sawat.
And stop this phony operation.
That day is not far when a resolution about Pakistan's military intervention will be passed by United Nations just like the bill which was passed against Jamat-ud-Dawah.
Riaz Ahmad Farooqi
The extremists of our country and their supporters themselves are constantly providing all evidences and justifications required for instigation of action against them, and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is passed, in all likelihood not a single voice would be raised in United Nations, in our favour.
And supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.
We are not aware and familiar with the character and achievements of Pir Sami-ullah and what his activities were.
Maybe he was not a revolutionist.
Like the deadbodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, Doctor Najeebullah and thousands of other revolutionists have been subjected to dishonour at the hands of the enemy.
They are immortal even after they die.
But there is a international game being played here in which place public is ruled by frightening through barbarism and ferociousness.
So that license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will clutch the government.
These acts of so called Islamic activists on the name of religion is without limit worthy of condemnation.
These supporters of extremists can see the injustice of America but instead of expressing grieve on those dishonest acts they clearly shun them by giving them name of tribal traditions.
Sometimes by cloaking in tribal traditions, sometimes on the name of Islam, any pious man cannot give reason for such dishonest acts.
In my view, our Army people are associated with theses people.
As such that when these people move from a place then it takes such time that they can be caught, there should be time for that but its a stretch that they get there on time even if they are there, they are long gone.
Are they so merciless that they kidnap fifty seventy men and our Army putting hand on hand looks at them like a spectator.
They are servant of Allah and  so is Army.
All in seeing that there is something wrong at the bottom.
Malaiat, In the period of The dictator of the time Zia-u-Lhaq he did not show good characteristics of sympathies of Allah but there is various tortures at the name of religion and more it his writing "What will be done after death."
And such persons use this fright as a way to get only this world respect.
O Speakers                                                                                                                                                              "preachers"
You frightened the world form fire of Hell.
That you became the image of fright.
Upon it wondered that when it is said that it cannot be a Muslim action.
We are ourself do not know this history or cover it for any purpose.


was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
without accepting reality neither the motives can be diminished nor correction can be made.
O' BBC please stop this dual-headed policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
please show some modesty, a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office.
the success of, operation Sherdil and across the border operation Lion heart, depends on the fact that in whose favor is the opinion of general public.
this act is of American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahab is a victim of this conspiracy.
all discussions on this forum will now be anti Taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined Taliban and they are doing what can change the public opinion.
I would like to ask only this. What were the soldiers doing when the corpse was kept hanging throughout a day? were they sitting there to aim only the common people? It is said that Taliban hideouts were bombed and a woman and two kids were killed when a house was attacked.
Why? Didn't they come to know about this great tragedy?
Were they leisurely having fun, or not?
Let us fold our hands to you in a request. For God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler who watches over all of us.
Though the question raised from the B.B.C. is substandard, it could only be felt pity at the poor quality of the writers. For instance, nobody asked this. What were the 3000 soldiers camping at Swat doing ?
The helpers of the army were hanging on poles the dead bodies of those who fought Taliban.
The cheating done to the commoners by the Pakistani soldiers is done, but, it is not right that the medias including B.B.C. has concealed the fact from the world.
The Pak soldiers are playing drama.
Every child in Swat whispers that it is a bloody drama.
Stop this drama for Godsake!
These Talibans have destroyed the image of muslims.
If the real muslims dont accept Taliban as muslims then why they get a refuge in thier places.
The one who are shameless and dont do hardwork and labour, take arms in their hands and join thier group.
Islam doesnt spread through sword and guns.
Have shame.
Its baseless and has no roots in any religion nor in family customs.
All media including BBC show different views on Taliban and Tribals.
Infact nobody knows the actual situation except us, becuase we are the natives.
(  sorry was pretty hard to translate)
This move has ashamed all the Muslims.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that current leadership will end this  cancer.
After Mumbai attacks India said that some extremists are behind the attacks.
Pakistan rejecting the accusations said that it will help India in investigation in every possible way.
India said that it has given a list to Pakistan that has 20 suspected extremists required by India.
Now Pakistan has said that included in the list Jaish-e-Muhammad's Molana Azhar Masood is not in custody and government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before that the president of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari refuted the view that west's secret agencies and Indian government has given evidence related to Mumbai attachs.
President Zardari has said that it has not been proved that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani.
During this, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that the its relations with India are not going to improve until its land is continued to be used for terrorism.
And in latest development, Indian Cricket team has cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should sports be effected due to these political events?
What future to you see of India Pakistan Relationship?
Neither America, nor India would break Pakistan.
Pakistan would be broken by the Pakistanis themselves.
What do you expect after such regionalism, communalism and vandalism.
Even Jinnah too did not do good towards the Muslim's of India. Time has proved this.
Yasmin, Chicago
Madam, if we kep working on the vision of Jinnah, the cancer of Communalism, Regionalism and Vandalism would not have spread in Pakistan. And also the Muslims of India would not have been treated this way.
It is our mistake of not producing a leader of his caliber
If we could pay the due respect to our heroes
This region has great potential.
God knows when this region will learn its lesson and its unity will bring regional development/prosperity.
Both countries have extremist forces like Taliban, Shiv sina and RSS etc... These extremist forces are enemies of the regional peace.
The imperial powers do not want peace and stability in this region.They are controlling these countries like puppets.
can you imagine the international influence of Pakistan, China and India, if they are united
Pakistan is under the occupation of corrupt and opportunist leadership.
May God protect our country, Pakistan.
But being a Pakistani we should not neglect the ground realities/threats. American forces have been deployed very near to our afghan borders.
Besides this the situation in the country doesnt seem to be stable, like in the NWFP, Baluchistan and Sindh, and the problems in Karachi are also evident.
In this atmosphere we need a leader that can unite the people of this country.
O God please show us some mercy.
I believe we have no other option but to go to war one last time.
Enough is enough.
It's now or never.
These fraudulent dialogues and pointless meetings are not the solution to the problems.
Neither is by committing small scale terrorist acts in each others territories.
After all it was only after waging the Second World War that Europe managed to sort its problems out.
And if it wasn't for this World War then they'd still be arguing and nagging each other over small things.
Almost all of our political parties are unified to the topic that terrorism and sectarian violence shall be eradicated from the country.
But own military leadership does not seem to be sincere on this topic. At one side Europe and America are assured that the military is sincere in achieving a terror free state but on the other hand helps the Taliban in disguise.
Now we have to think and define our path and select one path to focus on, Thank you.
There is no doubt that the elements of Jamat-ud-dawa include majority of those people who belong to Lashkar-e-Taiba which is a banned organization, is now established and operating with a new name Jamat-ud-dawa Pakistan.
However after that more focus was diverted towards humanitarian activities and now on India's strong request , the United Nations has also banned it and the government of Pakistan has also implemented a crack down on this organization.
In my opinion if these Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and get focused towards religion and humanitarian assistance then it is much better.
The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan which have used the name of Jihad to induct and nurture professional killers and criminals and their molana's are the same people who called Pakistan 'Plaeedistan' meaning un clean land. These are the people who use bad named for Pakistan.
Now they are trying their best to destroy Pakistan.
In reality they don't even get close to be called a Muslin, in fact they deserve to be called animals or barbarians
Pakistan security will stay at risk until these extremists are not eradicated from Pakistan.
Should we still  think that the innocent people will be charged with rules and regulation?
In this feurious world the job is war,their work is only to kill.
With this news my heart is broken.
What type of world is this in which  it is very difficult to follow and live with the preachings of Allah's islam .
Non muslim can kill muslim but when the muslim try to take revenge then all non muslim  with the whole world brother's  together think ,that the islamic preaching's are done with Hafiz Sayeed.
India is very upset on the attack on Mumbai.
Citizen of pakistan  has created the misunderstanding between two countries and in the up coming days the sitiuation will be  more worst.
India alway's blames the pakistan's terror group.
The up coming problems on the taluk ,has  been stoped.
The Indian security centres  has blamed the attack on Mumbai the Lashkar-e-tayab is responsible.
In this case, name of Jamat-ud-Dawa has come in the front many times.
This is the first time that relation between both the countries have worsen due to a terrorist activity in India
In December 2001, after the attacks on Indian Parliament, these two neighbors were on the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
Now Jamat-ud-Dawa, about which Security analysts say that it is in reality a new face of Lashker-e-Tayyaba. Restrictions on the party are being requested.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan do decisive operations against extreme activists on its land?
By banning Jamat-ud-Dawa, can  current Pak-India crisis be over?
crisis be over? and how important is it to close down the armed groups to keep constant peace between both countries?
Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly?
Will the Peace Council never show any alertness against the Muslims every time?
For this it is said that when the accuser is lazy the witness is active.
If seen India itself has become one useless realm.
Whose intelligence, army and other security officials has become useless, who for 72 hours have danced the dance of mole with terrorists and India is cheating the world by blaming Pakistan over its uselessness.
If one disbeliever dies then the whole world knows about it- why is this double accuracy?
To the dear nation of one nonpolitical, religious, farming organization...
Farqaan Farooq, Faisalabad
Until our Prophet(Peace be upon Him), great ancestors and Sufism gave the human beings the love and respect, religion Islam was more vast growing and ripening from peace and sparkle.
The Muslims also got promoted in every field.
But when this beautiful Religion rose to the hands of distillation then within the human beings began the difference of religious and disbeliever and the new gateways of pride and prejudice began to open by which the world was unknown before.
Salute, sir, salute happily, but get your work done on your own.
Do not do it under the pressure from America.
If India is in difficulty, let them prove it, no?
Why does it not give?
And why do they accuse us with everything?
There are fundamentalist groups and organisations, even in India. Why does no one put any restrictions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the whole world?
What is it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What is it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the first Islamic Nuclear State. Why, is what the fight is about.
Pakistan is on the verge of break up.
Kamranhassan, ABU DHABI
You are right, circumstances are supporting your argument.
Now even American magazines are publishing new maps of pakistan. These sanctions are the part of greater game plan.
Gradually,USA is making its grip stronger on Pakistan.
In this situation, if we'd not become a united nation then history of Bangladesh's creation can be repeated.
Terrorists' attack should be condemned, whether these are committed in Mumbai, Islamabad or in Philistine.
Terrorists should be uprooted without any discrimination of nationality.
The question arises, why Pakistan and other world is silent on the terror attacks in Pakistan, killing hundreds of innocent people?
if attack on Marriott was not act of terror?
then why-
hale to the advisor for interior Rehman Malik, how brave and bold has the gentleman become.
no imgage
not only this, but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under 'someones's pressure'.
wow, all praise to the Almighty!
whether having the ability or not or to say that I don't want.
We, the Pakistanis are fighting whose war.
and why we have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect.
No one has  a right to interfere anyone's national affairs.
The colonial system is apparently not there.
If people are sure to have justice or Allies support the importance of free judiciary and give respect to democratic institutes and dont support the dictatorial governments; peace can be achieved in third world countries including Pakistan. But this is not acceptable for allies
Pakistan is always in line with European and American interests.
Pakistan is forced to do so despite a majority of its population oppose it.
This enhances the opposite or anti sentiments.
If America and its Allies believe in Democracy, they should give up their colonial behavior and leave this region
Pakistan has ability to arm or disarm.
Security forces searched a camp of Lashar-i-tayba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
After Mumbai attacks, Pressure is being increased on Pakistan to take actions against extreme outfits
India blames that Lashar-i-tayba has role in Mumbai Attacks.
Condalisa rice, American foreign minister asked Pakistani leadership to take practical and transparent actions against those responsible for Mumbai attacks.
he believed the terrorists involved in Mumbai Attacks used the Pakistani soil.
Meanwhile, the officials in Peshawar has told that more than 50 trucks have been burnt by some unknown armed persons. These trucks were going to Afghanistan with goods for NATO forces.
These was the second attack on American supply during the last 48 hours.
Meanwhile Pakistani police cracked down a camp of Lashkar i Taiba, a banned outfit. Already many efforts have been made to disarmed the extremists, even money and indemnity was offered.
It is clear from the circumstances that efforts remain unsuccessful to dislodge the armed groups funded by Americans and Saudis during afghan war. It means efforts to restore Pre-80's Pakistan are fruitless.
Question arises, whether Pakistan wants to do so?
If Pakistan has an ability to do this?
What is your opinion?

I have only one question for the standard bearers of the world.
If you kill their children, will they come to garland you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill innocent public, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in negative, then you really need to fix your viewpoint.
The people were armed when there was the fear that Russia would head towards Pakistan after finishing Afghanistan, and that is why they were supplied arms.
Now, when there is the fear that America will capture Pakistan, via Afghanistan, as the president American president has clearly mentioned in his presidential mission, why should we disarm them now?
Only so that after defeating the American or Indian army, it does not have to face any resistance from the public?
Yes, if any of them are guilty of being involved in any destructive work, Pakistan can take action against them alone.
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
And another question is that were these terrorists not supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the present terrorism is in no way connected to it.
It must be remembered that Hafiz Saeed is the first 'Jehadi leader' who called the Taliban actions 'mischief'.
I am sure that the Taliban effect is a inseparable result of American plans, and hence every person who can stand in the way of Taliban must be removed.
Despite the support of the whole nation, the fact that Zardari and co. took action against the Lashkar is a clear sign of their frigid and kiss-up nature.
To stop the project that is running on Saudi-American funding, they must be requested themselves to regather, for God's sake, the filth that has polluted our society.
we will protest against them that in which ethical way America and Saudia has distributed Dangerous weapons and so called Jihad but actually they have distributed hatred literature and cultural virus which has created a human slaughter houses.
after the threat from India to attack Pakistan, Pakistan Military announces that he will pull his forces from Afghan border and put it towards India. Taliban also announces that they will take care of the Afghan border which resulted in a chaos In America and he Forced India not to do war with Pakistan.
In this Letter all the musket of American Power was exposed
in contrast India has never threatened nor he has the power to attack
the remaining damage is done by the Taliban by attacking the American convoy
this proved that without Pakistan Military and Government Of Pakistan support America is Nothing
Karachi, Pakistan's Main Business and Finance City which is Dubai of all the rural areas
Million never returned from here with empty hands, but when western areas law and order situation is worsen all attention is directed towards Karachi
now they want to hijack this city
for the first time Pathans are called by Pakhtuns,which is making city's people as stranger and fighting among each other, but to be united is necessity of time
One solution to this problem is that either the Urdu speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun speaking people learn Urdu, or better yet, both learn English.
You might think that this is a funny proposal, but does the cause of the conflict not seem funny?
That the cause of extremism be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, I actually shared this proposal many times in my childhood with my friends, which included people from all religious and linguistic groups, but these people used to laugh at me.
At that time, the religious and linguistic hate, which was not as lively and strong as they are today, were still developing within.
I can never understand what is happening and why?
Are these the signs of the Day of Judgement?
For what crime are innocent people being killed?
The reasons are in front of everybody. Those who want to break up Pakistan are the active ones, and those who do such things, have neither religion, nor country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns
Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir mean that which is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
At the height of the Mumbai attacks, the fact that the efforts to cause mischief on linguistic and racial lines in Karachi failed is proof that those politicians working on racial parole have resigned from their jobs.
The taking of the lives of innocent Pushtu speaking labourers and the Indian warnings have awakened the sleeping Pakistani feelings from Karachi to Khyber.
The identical country loving reaction of all the political, religious, linguistic and national parties has not only taught India the manners of diplomacy but it has also given the American policy makers a chance to think again.
The responsible parties for the worsening situation in Karachi are the United and the ANP, and the government is taking sides.
The government can control the situation in one hour, but it is purposely allowing it to grow.
The police and rangers are avoiding action because of the pressure on them by the political parties.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
These kinds of situations will happen until political pressure stays on the management. Allah keep Pakistan safe.
In my opinion, they are the biggest terrorists.
And of course there are external powers active in this. But no one knows who they are?
But what is sad the most is if this kind of situation occurred in some city of Sarhad, government would have done what not but now when it is not in Sarhad, the government is so helpless.
Government should do an operation here and save country's big and an important city.
Otherwise, Pakistan will face a big economic setback.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth being scared. On the other hand Pakistan's media's condition is even worse.
The complete truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is this that Urdu speaking people should learn Pashto or Pashto speaking people should learn Urdu or it is even better if everyone learns English.
You will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but don't you think the reason for collision is ridiculous?
The reason for persecution may be language ?
Another story of murder has finally been published in Karachi, which was being dreaded by all the citizens for a long time.
The criminals do not let go any opputunity of a crime. The news reports and the media are only telling 50% of what actually happened here in 4 days.
Have spent the last three nights without sleeping, and the fear is still there.
Those who make the people evacuate hotels, those who kill the shoe-makers and the peanut-sellers.
Those who rob and kill at the Super Highway, and cut off the ears of innocent citizens, they are ignorant of the wrath of Allah which will eventually entrap them.
What could be the reasons of this sudden turmoil in your opinion?
(B.B.C)
Keeping in view, the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai, we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in Karachi. It is simple and easy to guess that the turmoil is just due to an unconcious trade of blood.
Obviously if somebody infuriates a father, it would not be surprising if the son reacts violently.
the blood of the loyalists of Liaqat Ali Khan also belonged to the same place but to eliminate Mr. Psycho's misunderstanding I am writing this verse.
we will also repeat our elders' traditions
we made it by sacrificing lives and will save it by doing the same
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
it is very disappointing that whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
see Liaqat Ali Khan, you will will find out that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family from Karnal in Punjab.
due to his steps for the migrants, today the migrants consider him as one of them.
there is always a reaction to every action.
one can afford on oneself but.
Ejaz Aiwan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan, they did not face any reaction.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
One Muslim League N was left, even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q have made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment in the National Assembly and the Senate.
Till now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why  no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part that is they will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft, government speaker did not take any action.
MQM the government, Muslim League N in the opposition and Muslim League Q was the party who passed 17th amendment so how is it possible that these parties will be sincere in finishing the 17th amendment.
This is what is called getting credit for nothing.
People's party is already not in a hurry about finishing 17th amendment.
How can someone think of cutting their own hands?
17th amendment will not be canceled until Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of the majority in our survey and it is also true.
If 17th amendment was to be discarded then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf. Because with being the president, he is also the chairman of the People's Party.
17th amendment is valid until he is the president.
In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to bid Zardari farewell from the president house.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
Most of the elders in our family belong to labor class.
During your childhood when we our uncles doing their work we prayed Allah to protect us from physical labor.
To avoid this we wrote to the editor of monthly Amroz to ask him what to do after matriculation so that we would not have to do physical labor.
Editor in reply wrote that we should become Doctor or Engineer and study these courses.
We were inclined towards engineering and in matriculation we studied Technical drawing instead of Biology.
But at the time of admissions in FSc the elder brother forced us to study medical in FSc.
We hardly studied biology for a month before we started studying maths.
Means that to avoid physical labour we became engineer and we are in better position than many friends in our family and we thank Allah for it.
We remembered this when with out 2 young sons we were trying to lift carpets of old hour.
Now it hasn't been half an hour while we were working that the small son said "Daddy it seems that I am not born for this job"
We said that if so study good like us and build up your body.
The son started saying I am studying already, will be studying more but this work is not done by me.
Any how we three managed to complete the work within three hours and returned home.
The meaning of saying this is that if a man decides on one destiny then whatever comes afterward will not stop him to accomplish his destination.
Yes and if you don't really know what you have to do then Allah is the only protector for you.
There is a saying that never say bad for a dead but what to do, also at the first death anniversary of Benazeer we only see bad in her.
Benazeer for her own benefit forwarded to India the Sikhs' army, who were to fight the war of independent. On one side the independent movement of the Sikhs was collapsed and on the other side gave chance for India to concentrate on Kashmir after pushing down the Punjab movement.
It is the part of the distraction from the leadership of Benazeer and Nawaz Sharif which have pushed the country to many years backwards.
During exile Benazeer continued on keeping the series beneficiary information of Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
during her rule, Benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make as much money that is why he is known as Mr. Ten percent.
during Benazir's rule his brother got killed but his murderers are still safe from any punishment.
besides being a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
just like Benazir did her politics over her fathers dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came into power twice but she could not punish her the culprits of her father's political murder even she couldn't register a case against them.
it has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
what should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated 16th December as a didactic day and take such measures that this kind of incident don't take place again.
on this day we could send greeting to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again.
the rulers would reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Bahari's stuck in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines of life from the next day.
Only if East and West Pakistan could be one together just like East and West Germany was united once again.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be granted in the near future.
When it was announced in the news today that the Governor of the American State Illinois was arrested for corruption charges
and when the State Congress started getting ready to remove him from the position of the governor as soon as possible, then there is this one American companion who has a close watch on the circumstances of Pakistan, boastfully claimed to us that this is what we call democracy.
In America, even the higher level people can not transcendence the law.
And the other is your country, Pakistan, where even the President was chosen after the corruption charges against him were dropped.
My vein of loyalty throbbed and I said what is the big deal if a governor was arrested in America. In our Pakistan, once the Prime Minister was arrested and hanged overnight, and another time sent into exile.
Tell me, when did this happen in America?
In Pakistan, those who broke the law were sent out of the presidential palace with a guard of honor. Tell me when this happened in America.
The Chief Justice of Pakistan was removed in such a manner, that despite having public support, he could not be replaced until now. Has this happened in America?
In Pakistan, a fake-degree holder was made the Minister of Health. Did this happen in America?
Hearing this, the American laughed till he was tired and conceded defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded on all four sides by Americans.
It seems from his smile that
he thinks that America is with his government. He is forgetting that one year ago, they were with Pervez Musharraf.
the picture look like a picture of Family
before that no picture as such has been published in which President is with 3 American authorities
Look like that America's work has been increased in Pakistan and one and more Authorities are working on it or they might not believe that person as compared to the first one.
it might possible that they have planned also this, keeping in mind the nature of President Zardari promise fulfillment.
if there would any intelligent Politician than there would be atleast not smiling in this picture and his face should show some Embarcement
if Democracy principle applied on this picture than President Zardari is in Minority
According to Democracy, Majority is the ruler of Nation and who are they picture is showing
Heaven like Swat of Pakistan is also known as Switzerland.
till now, according to Government Policy, cross talks are also going along with the power use
but power use is resulting in increase power of Taliban and increasing sympathy for Taliban among people beside that it is not providing any benefits
Instead of using power, government should find out the real causes of the problem.
Fazalullah and Taliban will dissolve into nothingness if the root causes are terminated.
The Shariat bill suggested by the                                                                 The Shariat bill suggested by the ANP administration will, to a great extent, bring a solution for the problems in Swat.              a
But, in addition to the observance of the Shariat law, the administration will take care of the well being of the people.
The actions of General Musharaf made us believe that we had been made free from the unqualified politicians of the land. But, his ambition for more power changed everything.
How many expectations were there! He lost all hopes in "war and terror".
Hopes of taking actions were lost.
It seemed that he understood that the end of his reign was imminent along with the end of Bush administration. As a result, thieves were recruited to power centres.
General Musharaf was in a position to control the army. But the present administration does no know what is happening.
The army could not put down the terror in Baajodoh and Swat. The commoners are subjected to "bombardments and enmity" i.e, creating great loss to lives and properties. It also puts them into psychological disorder.
In Swat, the strongly affected part of Sarhad state, despite the continuity of military action for over one year, the situation is still going from bad to worse.
On one side, the government is only reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly. On the other side, the Taliban's illegal radio FM channel is having much more influence in the region.
On the third side, the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region.
During the action of the security forces, there were claims of destroying the fundamentalists by the bombing of gun ship helicopters and cannon houses, but despite these destructions, the Taliban only became more powerful, and according to an estimation, their control over Swat increased that much percent more.
As a result, on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat, and on the other hand the Taliban is stronger.
Who is stuck in  between? The poor civilians.
It is said in Swat, that someone asked what kind of people are the Taliban were, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of Allah and the religion'.
Then he asked how the army was, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country'.
He then asked who the enemies of the religion and the country were, so he got the answer, 'We civilians'.
I am wondering how the Pakistani Army will fight the Indian Army, when they couldn't control a small faction of the Taliban.
Could not track down Taliban's illegally operated FM channel which in my opinion is very easy.
But still FM was spreading hatred in full swing.
After girls schools now boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfew is imposed so that tablibans can move around easily.
Tonight 8 trucks entered the suburbs of Mingora during curfew and created bunkers.
The question is that how could they reach there during curfew.
Army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house and salutes Taliban.
For God sake someone tells this Army to protect helpless people of Sawat from Taliban and prove that Pakistan army can overcome any enemy.
He says that most of the blood is spilt in the name of religion, tell me that if religion was not then blood wouldnt have spilt?
Punjabi, Pathan, White and Blank, Mehsood and other tribes, are these the products of religion?
No not at all.A religion teaches that there is no white no black, there is no Punjabi no immigrant.If there was no religion then people would have destroyed each other and other things in the battle of black and white.
The religion only teaches the man how to be disciplined and mannered.Religion only shows the man that he has not come by himself instead he has been created by the Supreme Power God and He has sent you in this world to lead a life as per His orders.
Being a Muslim iam very sure that Islam is a complete religion  and moreover it is a true religion.
Even after the time i acquired the luxuries in London, I continued to call up my relatives on every morning to find out about their good and bad.Even though my relatives never bothered to call me ever in my life. But still i continued to do so. But the time when i felt that my relatives dont even like my calling them, i stopped making calls to them ever after.
Even i have felt the same here since i have spent my two years of life in France.
Why people keep expectation only from us to make a phone call to them in Patna.
About Iraq, within a few hours there would be an Army sent for the "peace" in the Darfar. This is not a problem for them.
The post action after the Mumbai Blasts and the security in the areas are a matter of few hours.
There are discussions and opinions on the matter where there are more risk to death in the areas of Mumbai through any sources.
Hey you the Protectors and leaders of the Peaceful world the life is being ended here only in the discussions.
is it really being waited to diminish.
so that any again no aggrieved could even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights.
when a father is running carrying his beloved sons dead body, even then your hearts don't pinch you with pain?
If not then you don't even deserve to be called human being.
but you are a black mottle over the name of humanity.
so atleast this has been proven that this region has also been a homeland for Jews for centuries.
ideally these two nations should have lived in harmony but since their strings are in Western and Arab hands, so without their will peace can not prevail in this region.
and now even Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
even if the Israeli operation stops temporarily, it will start again any moment after any incident.
BBC's own country has its interests related to America and Israel and this is why while taking cover of enlightened moderation, it has started a series of blogs or Jewism and doing a biased propaganda.
BBC is only completing a formality, and its goal and intent is only to gather well wishes.
I request the moderator to publish this comment of Fidwi, so it be known that at least a little bit of affinity towards truth is still remaining in BBC
Thank You.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How could I not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time, including Derah Gahzi Khan, summer showers are taking place throughout the country.
A poem on climate is presented to you. May you enjoy the sweet rain when you read this poem.
It rains just because of you
whatever rains is the spring
whichever comes to a standstill is tranquility
Sometimes comes, with no reason
Often spreads wide in the night hours
Often quite noisily, often silently
It rains.. but just because of you
whichever cherishing memory, whichever night
A suppressed music!
Sometimes he put it out
sometimes he lit himself up
sometimes every drop carries sorrow
These rains are quite like you
All these leaders are about to run holding a very sensitive case, little do they care if the country survives or not.
The people should they sell their possessions or be wiping clean the temples with lemon peals.
And like our leaders our media is corrupted as well
Its sole purpose is to extract money from the government.
And the people are oblivious about this,
An odd incident took place yesterday noon.
All police are running here and there, but don't ask about illegal parking.
What's more, NYPD traffic was not in the state where it could look at illegally parked vehicles.
Something like this happened, that a plane of the US Air really became a ship and landed in the Hudson river.
Until now, we only now that terrorists are of the descendants of geese.
Yesterday was perhaps historic cold, in New York.
The temperature does not fall this much.
Even my jaws started hurting from my half an hour walk outside.
Imagine, how the people who jumped from the plane into the river would have felt.
It is a matter of happiness that all people were safe.
And it was sad that the companies plane drowned during this financial crisis.
I went by West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I still do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, in my one hour trip, the way had opened at least a bit, so I was able to get the 56th street exit.
Otherwise, I had not taken the previous two exits, seeing the lines waiting at them.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women

Apart from this, there is no other way.
At this farm, one has to get his own meat done,, including removing the skin.

For no reason, we thought that the Taliban group from Sawat was non religious, who were only against women education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
But like majority of the ideas, this was not proven right also. According to this news of CNN, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a Boys school with gunpowder.
Swat, The Taliban has destroyed a boys school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Amen, then Amen.
Masha Allah, up till now, 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom of fixing marriages before birth among Muslims, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See a picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
Some days go, a girl's marriage with a dog become fresh.
see that now
Humanity is rare in 21st century.
It is the age of computer. computer has occupied its space in every walk of life.
Many people have objections over interference of computer as its role in financial matters.
Although credit card users have facility but their personal life is under more control of law enforcement agencies.
Now the record of financial matters can easily be tracked by using credit card.
In future when usage of currency will become lesser, its importance will increase.
In crime world risk is not taken to rob banks. Now credit card information is stolen.
Similarly friends are also made through computers.
Social networking sites, like Orkut, Facebook and Myspace are at first level of acceptance.
But do you not think that the more we are following these social networking sites, the further we are getting from people in real life?
Similar are the match making websites, where your desires are matched with others desires and you are shown a list of the people who match with you.
But can you lead a life with a person who is just like you?
I can not, and that is why the spouse is called the better half,
because he/she will get rid of the faults within me.
Perhaps I have got a small share of sense.
I used to believe everything someone elder says.
In the same way, I thought that my father knew the answer to every question on earth.
I used to get laughed at a lot for this.
But only that saying seemed true which could be possible.
Become much irritation because what was the reason to tell lie?
Bore loss on that saying even at this age
So it is my effort to say lie the very least.
Do not misguide someone by lieing and that also by attaching Allah's name.
and Allah willing say only when there is pray to Allah that work completes.
Remaining Allah knows better the state of intention.
This is a disgusting problem which is created due to reason of distance from religion.
According to law of both our Pakistan and religion, minor child should stay with mother.
Their expense is due to their father and father can meet with children.
Then when the child becomes of age, he or she can stay with whomever they will.
You rightly mentioned that the actual problem is that of the relatives who mislead.
Possessiveness is present in all our actions.
It is this very factor in effect over here, that there will be new shareholders in the father's property born, and they will go against him. Otherwise his fathers action is commendable.
These restrictions have caused social evils, even in our marriages.
The concept of the marriage of a divorced woman or a widow has become obscure.
It is these wasteful ideologies and baseless traditions that have made the family structure a mess.
In our society, if the wife of a 50-55 year old man or the husband of such a wife passes away, why are they not looked at in a nice manner?
Near us, there is a Pakistani uncle, whose wife passed away 10-12 years ago. Now, after marrying off all his children, he has married a widow, so even his children have gone against him.
I believe this is his legitimate right. What do you say?
What type of mentality is the 'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place', kind of mentality?
I believe that this persons children should have thought what is wrong if he married a widow, after he married off all his children?
Thereby, this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
As the children would definitely have gotten busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow if their wives refuse to look after them, when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society, which we are facing for the last 40-50 years.
A wife can accept her husband going around having illicit relations, but she cannot stand him having a second wife.
If possible, stop him from doing so, even after you die.
She destroys her husband and her own hereafter, and becomes a cause for spreading filthiness in the society.
Chanting Islam, Islam does not mean anything. In reality, we like only our culture and traditions.
For instance keeping girls  from gaining education and fearing marrying the girl of ones choice.
As for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house, so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax, (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt).
In the Indo Pak subcontinent, Islam was accepted centuries ago, but it could not yet leave its ignorant mentality and has always kept culture and tradition above Islam.
Thinking of a man's second marriage as an innovation, divorce as a clinical rest, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife, is all a part of this mentality.
What's more, in mimicry of the western countries, we have started to consider piety and veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam is easy, but leaving this mentality is very tough.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Amen

Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes that i found this secret in my life that if leader of any Army is in front line then that Army will never lose.
But here situation is else.

if someone from common people dies then murder

Today, as I was returning to my shop, after Isha prayer, when a man sitting in a car at the circle raised his hand and diverted my attention towards him.
I thought this man might have lost his way, or he might want to ask something, so I stopped, and his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked whether I could understand Arabic well or not. I said no problem, tell me what you want.
He started to say that I have come from Riyadh, to Madinah, but someone has pick-pocketed me, so please help me out. I asked him to excuse me, as such an incident had taken place with me previously, that I had given the person 20 Riyals to buy petrol to reach Riyadh, but he went a little ahead and started to ask somebody else.
I got very angry and scolded him and warned him that I would call the soldiers, so he got very frightened.
Now the situation  has become, that we Muslims come on cars, with our families to beg throughout the day and gain at least two or three thousand illegally.
Whereas there is a clear Hadith of the Prophet (SAWS) that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand; the lower hand being the begging hand and the upper hand being the giving one.
May Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims (Amen, Amen)

Famous singer Adnan Sami's wife reached a police station in Mumbai, accusing him of torturing her.
The Police station advised her to contact a court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Giladari gave a complaint against her husband saying that he continuously tortures her.
and that he treats her in a non-human manner.
Now, it has become difficult for her to bear, and that is why she has filed a case against him.
The police, instead of filing a case, told her to contact a court, saying that this matter was not one in which the police could put their hands.
In your opinion, is the accusation against Adnan Sami, by his wife proper?
This is not an Indian effort to disgrace Adnan Sami, is it?
Let us know about your opinion on this issue.
Adam, Sanghad, Mehr
As far as accusations go, any person can accuse the other.
To get enraged for honor is not sensible.
Whatever be the case between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he had left his honorable life and went to India to earn money. Now that fame has fallen around his neck.
This is the result of his own actions.
Washington...
High ambassadors of America say that President Obama will take a strong stand against Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
In America's new policy for Afghanistan, instead of development, war has been given more importance.
The envoys say that Hamid Karzai is being considered a barrier in the achievement of American goals in Afghanistan, as there is corruption in the government and the business of middlemen has increased and the Taliban are once more gathering strength.
The American envoys say that among the people in the American government who are stressing upon Hamid Karzai to do something more are Vice President Joseph Biden and President Obama's representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Hallbrooke.
He said that this good administration was noticed after the President Bush left, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai after every 2 weeks and used to emphasize on the role of America in Afghanistan and the development of its city departments.
Officials say that Obama management will work with the state leaders as a backup with the main government.
Officials say that they will emphasize Hamid Karzai on fighting against corruption
Hamid Karzai faces new elections this year. And it is not clear as yet that Obama and his companions will favor his presidency or not.
Is this statement, of the American officials, a forecast of change in American policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is this era of Hamid Karzai ending?
What are your thoughts in this matter?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and SriLanka, Srilanka defeated Pakistan with 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Srilanka in the first one-day match although Srilanka won in the next two matches.
In this third one-day match, the nation's team performance was very poor. They worn out in only 75 runs in 23 overs against 309 runs made by the national team of Srilanka.And this is how we faced a lesson learning defeat.
the result of the series proves that the National team has no consistency in its performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
which departments of the game should be addressed more by the authorities?
are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
which department you will hold responsible for the defeat, fielding, batting or bowling?
please provide your feedback.
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish  traditions continue. these feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule, who would call them Muslims?
a Sardar should walk himself over these embers. why the present government do not act against them?
when the judicial justice will come in handy.
the Srilankan cricket team has arrived Karachi to play One Day internationals.
Despite the tensions between Pakistan and India it is nice to see a foreign team visit Pakistan.
On reaching the Karachi airport the Sirilankan team was given a warm welcome.
There will be two one day matches in Karachi and one in Lahore between Pakistan and Sirilanka.
There have been bold statements from both sides regarding their bowling, batting and fielding.
If the Sirilankans are proud of their spinners than Pakistan has its fast bowlers.
The Sirilankan captain Mahela Jayawardene has said that no one player of the Pakistan team can be singled out as a threat, the whole team is dangerous.
Muralitharan and Mendis are said to be trump cards while the Pakistani captain has said that the competition will be a tough one.
Shoaib Malik said that they've already played Muralitharan and that they'll see off Mendis as well, he also said that they've got a secret game plan that they'll reveal on the pitch.
Can it really be that according to the Pakistani and Sirilankan claims the contest will be a gripping one?
Who will have the upper hand when the series between Pakistan and Sirilanka gets underway?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Give your opinion.
Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.

How is all this is double for these people, when the Kashmiri people have been fighting for independence for the last 60 years?
No, no one asked, and they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism, so they start talking about making up.
First they openly killed the Muslims, now they are in the efforts of setting things right.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating such a situation that the world's attention can be diverted from Kashmir.
but Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now the British Government is also understanding that the Indians are taking cover from their occupation over Kashmir by blaming Pakistan of terrorism.
and they hesitate to talk to Pakistan over this issue.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that by resolving the issue of Kashmir will bring an end to extremism, the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
it should be clear that the newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister while talking to media in Mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Is India using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialog?
Let us know of your opinion.
Usman Aftab,
I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
Rather it wants to keep it in check, and hence is thinking of taking certain steps. They know that Pakistan is a nuclear state.
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries are only thinking that if they corner Pakistan, they would face some political and geographic problems. They want to help Pakistan, but also want to be successful in their goal.
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn Pakistan.
We are ready by all means. Indian Army chief should keep his mouth shut.

Political statements are coming under the mischievous support of America. America is crazy and now Indians are going on the same pattern. if India has courage to attack, it should to know the ground reality.
Israel is attacking Hamas and no one has courage to stop Israel. Following Israel, Indian also wants to do some adventure.
PM said that Byden had a great role in shedding Musharraf's uniform and restoring the democracy. That is why he has awarded SI.
No political party can get the credit of uniform shedding and the restoration of democracy. Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in Parliament.
PM said that Dr. Qadir's chapter had closed.

After the completion of Qaide Aazam Trophy match between PIA and Habeeb bank the all rounder cricketer Shahid Affridi had quarrel with one fan.
When Shahid Affridi came out of the drawing room after playing the match on the UBL ground then a big number of fans gathered him.
On one situation a fan held the hand and asked to take a photo with him on which Shahid Affridi removing his hand said that he can take the photo tomorrow but on fan's insistence Affridi became angry and slapped him, before they start a quarrel the gathering people just dismissed the matter there itself.

Any way, I beg pardon for this drama.

This is a sad calamity that Israeli is massacring the Palestinians and the same situation is prevalent in Kashmir, but there is no effect on the Security Council.
All the organisations present in Palestine and Kashmir should keep their war going until they gain independence, and they should form unity among themselves and keep facing any type of harm, and one day or the other their martyrdom will give fruit, God Willing.
The air attacks by Israel on Gaza are continuing, just the same. Until now, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
Important Hamas leader Nazariyan was killed along with hwife and children.
Here the Security Council meeting concluded without any decision.
The meeting saw American opposition to the derogatory resolutions passed against Israel by Libya and other Arab countries.
Israel's jet planes have been bombarding on the residential areas of Palestine for last many days.
Every country around the world began to protest against the Mumbai attacks but can't anyone see this brutality including America and Britain?
Why are the major Muslim countries quiet?
What is your opinion on these double standards of the world.
Saeed, New York.
In my opinion, the basic fact is that most of our people are uneducated and they don't even know where their money is actually going. Government is interested in doing it's job properly by applying and collecting taxes. Shortfall of electricity and gas will continue in the same manner.
Because everyone knows about the character of those who have been elected by our own nation.
Crisis of electricity and gas all over Pakistan has become a critical state.
On the other hand the GAS tariff has been raised to 8% where as in some cities due to the non availability of the petrol is increasing the difficulties and miseries of the masses.
Due to the long load shedding of electricity and gas crisis in Pakistan's industrial and business sector, there is a severe reaction. Riots and violent protests are taking place.
Industry holders gave ultimatem to stop mills.
Here there is unbelivable situation in cities by the load shedding of light in Karachi from 8 to 10 hours.
The industrial became aproximatly hand less and feet less.
Government institutes are showing their openions by blaming one another.
Talks with nation of increase the prices of electric and gas in not a jok.
Why did not pay attention to solve these problems.
The government is not going to work for upwards.
What will you suggest about the control this big problem.
Aware me about your openion.
After the loss of Imram, that as there are people as there are commonders.
I wonder those who shout slogans for an administration of the public create nuisance to the public.
It is torture not to get jelly, petroleum and gas.
Government departments have lost control.
Law and order has been degenerated. May Allah show his mercy  on this country of ours.
A new year has begun.
Last year was a year of political turmoil and chaos. The year will be remembered for terrorism too.

The new year has set in. How do you feel now at the new year's arrival?
In your opinion, What colour will the political and geographical situations in the country take? What tricks will Obama adopt?
Is it possible to predict an end to the threatening terrorism?
Will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?
What turn will the Indo-Pak relations take?
Is there any chance of a surgical strike or a full-fledged war?
What are your expectations for the new year?

It is the first death anniversary of Benazir Bhutto. She was slain after an election rally in Liaqat Bagh, Rawalpindi on 27th December 2007.
Benazir is not among us today. She was a thoughtful politician and a world reknowned figure. She held a special status in national politics.
Although it's been a year now yet the enigma of her death remains unsolved.
Her efforts to bring democracy to Pakistan were not in vain.
Today a democratic government exists in Pakistan and her husband Asif Zardari currently holds the position of Pakistan President.
What do you think is the role of martyr Benazir Bhutto in Pakistani politics?
Who can be behind murdering her?
Recently,, she was given the global human rights award. What would you like to say about her democratic and political services?
After ruling over America for eight years, President Bush left the White House, for presidential camp office, Camp David, so that the White House can be decorated and prepared for new President Barack Obama, according to his wishes.
In Bush's eight year presidency, the historic World Trade Center attack, the attack on the Pentagon, the action against Afghanistan and Iraq in the name of a global war against terrorism, in which armies of many countries were pulled into the war, and American resources were completely exhausted, were some of the memorable events of the Bush era.
As a result of this war, America had to face the worst economic and financial crisis in history.
What do you think the world got and what do you think they lost, as a result of this war?
Were the policies of President Bush successful?
What are your views of the Bush era?
The Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from touring Pakistan.
The Indian Cricket Team had to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20 twenty on Pakistan Tour.
The Vice-President of the Indian Cricket Board Rajeev Shukla who spoke to the news said that the board has asked the Government to allow the Pakistan Tour but because of the serious matters between the two countries this tour is not possible.
Is it right to use available political issue of the Indian government as the passport to cancel the cricket tour, the games must not be kept away from politics?
Isn't the decision of the Indian Government towards cricket a loss?
Even though the security in India was poor, the English Cricket Team tour was going on, so why don't the Indian team do the Pakistan Tour?
What is your opinion in this regard?
Salman, Karachi.
People who feel proud on going to India.
And their films and videos which are made there, now their eyes must open to see that how much the Indian people respect you.
I remember one interview of Adnan Samee where he said I am not a Pakistani, my popularity is British.
Adnan Sami needs that he should come to Pakistan at first opportunity because respect did not suited him even there.

Indians attitude have changed after Mumbai attack.
Jagjit showed his reaction in this form that he hates Pakistan and Pakistani.
it should be known that Adnan Sami sung seven songs of Asha Bhosla, now how can he be out of tune, Adnan Sami should stay in India, no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam
Karachi, i will only say this on the statement of Jagjit Singh that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements suitable to situation Pakistanis open your eyes that how much you are given worth in India, understand the thinking of Hindu.
After the Mumbai incident, their hateful statements have increased now they are spitting poison against popular singer Adnan Sami.
Without my permission at all, a dream takes place in my mind. I must have a house in a beautiful evergreen valley. There must be flowering trees on top of the hill.
Each morning at least one among the flowers that fall from the trees should reach the valley, where my small nest-like house situates.
The second thing was that about your future.
At night, while sleeping on the terrace, I must be able to view the whole star bloomed sky.
Seeing the melting mist in the valley, seeing the gold- bangled hands working in the tiled kitchen, watching my hard work blooming up in the compound.
Looking at the twinkling stars, feeling the softness of fondling fingers, inhaling the fragrance of night jasmine.
What is your opinion about this?
By wearing a mask repeatedly, you have lost your face. You have developed the art of having the brightness of truth even while uttering point blank lies.

When my problem is something concerned with money.

The consequence of the fact that it is very dangerous to face the problems that arise in the world future.
Today itself start for the well beings of the people
What did the people seriously think about that?
Poverty, financial crisis, diseases are the main challenges that people going to face in the world in future.
