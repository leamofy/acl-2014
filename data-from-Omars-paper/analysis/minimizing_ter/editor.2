Avoiding Dieting to Prevent the Flu.
For their research, American scientists experimented on mice.
Experiments proved that mice on a lower calorie diet had comparatively less ability to fight the flu virus.
Research disproved the old axiom that "Starve a fever, feed a cold".
According to scientists, eat a lot during a fever.
Researchers from Michigan State University say that mice fed diet food were found to have a significantly decreased ability to fight infection along with an increased chance of death. On the other hand, mice getting a regular diet had more energy against the flu virus.
According to Professor Elizabeth Gardner, people who diet will not be affected with flu sooner but they will need more time to recover from it.
She also said that those people who receive the flu vaccine should also avoid dieting during the winter months.
'First nuclear experiment was done in 1990'
Thomas Reid, who has worked in the Lever National Laboratory in America as a weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the former director of technical intelligence at Los Alamos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.
This book was titled "Nuclear Express: Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation," and both writers have claimed that whichever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or had the support of another nuclear power.
In an interview with U.S. news agencies, Thomas Reid said that in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's rule, China experimented with Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Thomas Reid said that for many reasons, he believes that China had experimented with Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
The reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.
He further added that this was the reason that in 1998 in a span of only two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments in response to Indian nuclear experiments.
Thomas Reid reminds us that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiments.
He further said that atomic bomb test Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998 was made with extreme care, and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.
When Thomas Reeds was questioned about China providing nuclear technology to Pakistan he replied that India was a common enemy for Pakistan and China.
He said that there is a proof that Doctor Abdul Qadeer Khan used Chinese designs, and the documents which were acquired from Libya confirm this statement.
He further stated that doing combined nuclear tests is common, and that in 1990 the United States conducted a nuclear test for Britain on an open belt in the Nevada desert.
He said that he also assumed that Israel was given access to the results of this test.
Thomas Reed was also questioned whether the Chinese nuclear spread program is continuing?
On this, Thomas Reed said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and design to a nuclear facility in Iran's city Isfahan since 1990.
Additionally, China provided Iran a nuclear enrichment plant.
He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen thorough North Korea.

Protest against the agreement with Journalists.
I refuse to accept the cynical notion that nation after nation must pursue a militaristic  goal of potential thermonuclear destruction. I believe that pacifism, honesty, and love will have the final word in the modern world.
I believe that even amid today's mortar bursts and whining bullets, there is still hope for a brighter tomorrow. I believe that wounded justice, lying prostrate on the blood flowing streets of our nation can be lifted from this dust of shame or reign supreme among the children of men.
I have the audacity to believe that people everywhere can have three meals a day for their bodies, education and culture for their minds, and dignity, equality and freedom for their spirits.
This faith will give us courage to face the uncertainties of the future. It will give our tired bodies new strength as we advance toward the city of freedom.
When our days become dreary with low-hovering clouds and our nights become darker than a thousand midnights, we will know that we are living in the creative turmoil of a genuine civilization.
The rich variety of bird life can lead to exciting discoveries for any bird watcher who has the requisite enthusiasm and  perseverance.
In truth, there is little danger from an elephant unless it is a rogue or a female with a small calf.
I still believe that one day mankind will bow before the altars of God and be crowned triumphant over war and bloodshed.  Non-violence will be proclaimed the rule of the land.  The lion and the lamb shall lie down together, and every man shall sit under his own vine.
I was also asked how I could subsist on the little food I ate at meals.  Again, this knowledge was obtained by watching me eat until I mustered enough courage to shut the kitchen door.
The villagers were curious about me, which strangely, I had not anticipated.  Their curiosity showed itself in their direct questions.

Balochistan Pipeline Blown Up.
According to the police, this was an eighteen inch wide pipeline that goes to the various wells in the gas plant of Peer mountain, and it was blown up by unidentified individuals in the morning.
Apart from this, yesterday well number three was destroyed in a blast and a gas pipe line was harmed by a blast near Allah Yaar hill.
The responsibility for these blasts were claimed by the spokesperson for the banned organization, Baloch Republican Army, Sarbaz Baloch.
From the beginning of the year 2009, there was an increase in the number of extremist incidents.
In this month, there were dozens of incidents of gas pipes being blown up, and there were also an increase in attacks on trains and people from the state of Punjab.
Though the Chief Minister of Balochistan, Nawab Aslam Raeesani, expressed distress over these incidents, and the police were instructed to share information with intelligence agencies, but it still wasn't possible to stop these incidents.
The 819 trillion dollar economic reform package was accepted.
No member who was part of any Republican party voted for this plan by President Obama.
The Republican party said that this economic plan was very expensive and that it would not be successful.
Among the representatives of the houses, 240 votes were given in favor of the plan, while 188 votes were given against it.
This economic reform plan has to be produced to the Senate next week, where the ruling Democratic party has a very large majority.
It is feared that due to opposition from the Republican party, its passing in the senate may not be easy.
After the passing of the economic reform plan among the representatives of the houses, Barack Obama said to the members, forcing them, that they should not let political differences get in the way of this important plan.
The President said that plan, which he hoped would become law by next month, would prove helpful in creating a suitable environment in the country, because of which business would prosper in the country.
According to this plan, the common man and the businessmen would be relieved of 275 trillion dollars of debt, and 540 trillion dollars would be given for fixing roads, bridges, ten thousand schools, and for unemployment allowance and research on new technology.
The editor of BBC in Washington, Richard Lister said that Barack Obama had decided to put political differences behind his back and prepare a new political culture, but this economic package has once again created bitterness on political lines.
In the National Assembly, a member of the Republican Party has rejected the bill by Congress, declaring it a waste of money and saying that no employment opportunities can arise from it.
He instead brings attention to his own bill which puts emphasis on tax cuts.
He said that with this proposal, with less investment, many employment opportunities can be created.
He said that with respect to development opportunities, tax cuts can create employment opportunities.
Bitterness Between Israel President and Turk Prime Minister
Rajab Tayb Urdan nearly shouted as he said to the Israeli President that too much blood has been spilled in Gaza and he felt ashamed that people were applauding such a military coup.
Mr. Urdan said, "I feel that you are using such words in order to hide your guilt. You killed those children, and I am mourning the death of those killed at the shore."
Shamon Perez has said that Gaza's incident was not due to Israel; it was Hamas who created a dangerous dictatorship.
C.A. Davis, correspondent of the BBC, has said that an incident like this is unprecedented.
Afterwards Urdan said that he respects the Israeli President and his age, one of the issues upon which he berated the President, but what the President was saying was far from the truth.
Turkey is one of few Muslim countries which has diplomatic ties with Israel, but there has been acrimony between the two countries for the last few years.
Attacks planned on Pakistan.
Wajid Shams UL Hassan tells the NDTV that Pakistan will soon publish the investigative report on the Mumbai Attacks.
Last year, 170 people lost their lives in the Mumbai Attacks.
Now India is holding the Lashkar-i-Taiba, an extremist outfit, responsible for the Mumbai attacks
India also claim that non-governmental Pakistani actors also have a role in the Mumbai attacks.
Pakistan-India relationships are badly hurt by the Mumbai attacks.
High Commissioner Wajid Shams Ul Hassan gave a statement to the press giving clues as to what the investigative report may contain.
Wajid Shams-ul-Hasan said that the investigative report denied that Pakistani soil has been used.
It could be any country but Great Britain.
these two places( Pakistan and Britain )are what I am conscious about.
Indian and the international world put too much pressure on Pakistan to take action against those responsible for Mumbai attacks. Pakistan said that it has taken action against many people who are possibly behind the Mumbai attacks and dozens of people have been arrested.
Wajid Sahms Ul Hassan Said that: we our not trying to hide this.
We believe in acting on reality.
our investigation will be accepted by the world.
We (through investigation) will try to satisfy India by evidence.
He defended delaying of the Pakistani investigation saying that these types of clues take time to gather, understand and investigate.
Commissioner Wajid shams Ul Hassan said that India has taken 45 days to show his Dozier.
Republican leaders also elected Red Indian.

During the  election for the position of chairman of the party, Katen Dawsen, candidate opposite to Steel, was given 70 votes. Whereas, former chairman Dunken abdicated from the competition in the second round.
People say that of the five candidates who ran for the position of the chairmanship of the republican party, Michael Steel was considered the most conservative among them.
After his win, Michael Steel said in his speech "We are saying to our friends and enemies together, come with us, but those who will cause problems in this, be prepared to separate from us." Michael Steel is from Maryland, where he has also been the deputy governor.
He became famous in 2006 when he ran for a seat in the senate.
But after losing in the senate elections he was appointed as the chairman of one political conservative committee of the party.
Now after being selected as the chairman of the party, the efforts of the Republican Party campaign in the entire country will be under his supervision.
He fought elections for this promise that he will give the party a new cause. And that he will use a new technique to join conservative supporters to the party.
Indian claims presence of Lashker-e-Tayyaba and Josh-e-Muhammad in Jammu.
There are reports that terrorists are present in the Poonch tribal area of Jammu.
According to official sources, police and the army surrounded the area and started the search upon receiving secret information.
In this period, small fights ensued in which four militants, two soldiers and one police agent were killed.
According to sources, these fights were going on until the last reports received. Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad militants are present in these regions, to fight with the army battalions that were sent there.
Meanwhile, the Chief Minister selected by the Joint Government, Umar Abdullah, met the governor and informed him about his being selected the leader of his party. The National Conference in the assembly.
The Allied Party of the National Conference, the Congress, also informed the governor of their support for Umar Abdullah.
Umar Abdullah will be administered the oath as the Chief Minister of the State tomorrow.
Note that in the recently held state elections, the National Conference got 28 out of the 87 seats of the Parliament, coming forth the biggest party. It should be clear that separatist groups boycotted the elections.
Congress, which got 17 seats, was prepared to form a joint government with the National Conference.
Today, upon reaching Srinagar, Umar Abdullah was jubilantly greeted by the party members.
On this occasion, Umar Abdullah said that he would try to play a role in generating dialog between the Indian government and separatists. However, this would not be possible until the elections took place and the new government came to power in India.
The Role of the European Union in Peace Making in the Middle East.
If looked at from a governments perspective, of the diplomatic efforts going on to stop the Middle East war, those of the European Union are the most decisive.
According to the state policy of Brussels, the efforts of the Shwarzenburg delegation or those of Sarkozy, are similar to giving a helping hand.
The spokesperson of the European Commission, Amadeu Altafaj, said that every effort which helps advancing the joint message of the European Union to the two parties, is welcome.
As far as the state policy is concerned, everyone seems alright.
However, in reality, the European Union is in a sad state of internal differences from the inside.
As the president of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is weak, to begin with.
On top of that, internal fighting has made it all the more helpless.
On the other hand, French President Sarkozy's demeanor is such that, one would think that he was the president of the Union.
Though France has completed it's 6 month presidency period.
Sarkozy wants to play a presidential role, and he is able to but he does not have the permission to do so.
The Foreign Minister of France, Bernard Kouchner, faces a most ridiculous situation.
He is part of the delegation, which is being headed by Schwarzenberg, the Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic.
What's worse, both the foreign ministers are giving different statements about the war in the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself whereas according to Kouchner this war does not come under defense policy. On the other side, Germany has also sent its special ambassador to Middle East. European Union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues.
Its evidence is the reaction of Israel who does not pay an importance to the conciliation efforts of the EU.
The EU has a golden opportunity to get something done, due to American Middle Eastern policy under President George W. Bush.
Economic Setback Leads to Suicide of German Billionaire
Adolf Meerklay, residing in the Sawabia in southern Germany, left behind a great business group.
Previously, most German citizens did not know much about him.
Later when he had to conference, about the loan given to his industrial group, with almost 30 banks for many weeks, he also became topic of the headlines. And he could see a dark future of Meerklay groups.
The Merkel Group had to suffer financial losses of many millions of Euro after its investment to buy shares of German auto maker Volkswagen.
Then monetary institutions canceled this groups loan amounting 700 million and another 1 billion Euro it necessarily required and hence Merkel came into extreme pressure.
Some time back the bank agreed to provide Merkel Group an emergency loan but Adolf Merkel who raised from a small industrialist to the position of a strong industrial group which has an annual income approximately 30 billion Euro, could not bare the loss in his investment capability.
Adolf Merkel, after the death of his parents started managing the business and took to modernize it. The business under his supervision became very popular and more strong.
He named his company Ratiopharm, which is today Germany's very large acclaimed and successful pharmaceutical company.
Some time back the commercial value of this company was in between 5 and 6 billion Euro and still was earning a revenue of 8.1 billion Euro annually. After the great success of Ratiopharm, the Merkel Group acquired many big businesses which included building materials maker Hydelberg cement to modified/special car maker Kassbohrer company.
The workforce of Merkel Group is nearly about 100,000 throughout the world and its assets include Ratiopharm which always was the most important business in the portfolio.
Adolf Merkel during his liftime expressed the view may a time that "" It has been four generations that we have been in pharmaceutical business.
Now the management of this institution is with my children and I hope this institution will be for few hundred years be managed by and in possession of my family.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, the banks have provided approval for temporary loans of 400 million Euro for VEM Group but added the condition that VEM should sell off Ratiopharm to improve the financial situation for a long term sustainability.
After the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain the same.
Crime rate among the immigrants in Germany.
According to the fresh statistics, crime rate among the immigrants from 2004 to 2007 is
Reduced from 9.22%
to 4.21%
According to Joachim Herrmann, the interior minister of Baweria province, this is a positive change.
He said: "It is important to note that the number of foreigners getting German citizenship is increasing."
Therefore it should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German, his background is foreign.
Herrmann said that his province will take this in to account when gathering statistics in 2010.
Besides Baweria, Hamburg is also thinking in the same lines.
The internal affairs senator related with the matters of CDU, Cristoph said: ""When research is done in a scientific manner, Ahlhaus, man can not bring about its required results as it wills, but rather, it depends on the numbers and statistics that come out from the research."
He referred to a crime prevention state-wise objective report, Ahlhaus, which was prepared in 2006 and on the face of which he researched this information. It was reported as to what percent of the people committing crime from Bergdorf to Hamburg were foreigners.
From the results, it became clear that the foreigners there
had a lower crime percentage than the crimes taking place in the whole state.
Contrary to this, during 2006, when the percentage of youngsters committing crimes was calculated, it became evident that the youngsters from a foreign background committing crime was 44
.7 percent.
However, the various German political parties such as SPD, environmentalist party, grains, and left wing party Linkspartei are against finding out during the collecting of crime statistics, drawing a distinction which German citizen is of foreign background.

The previous American administration also increased ties with India.

Mehr news agency reported from German news agencies that American President George Bush said in his farewell speech, addressing his successor Barack Obama and the whole nation, that if compared to seven years ago, America is relatively safe, nevertheless, the threat of terrorism is still floating over the head of America.
The history of civilization has shown that man must always know the proper and improper use of knowledge gained through scientific research. This has never been more true than in our own age.
In a relatively brief period of time, amazing discoveries have been made and applied to practical purposes. It has become platitude to say that we are living in an age of revolution. It would be ignoble not to recognize how immense the boons which science has given to mankind happen to be. Science has brought to us multitudes of benefits and advantages which only a short time ago were the privileges of the few. It has shown us how malnutrition, hunger and disease can be overcome.
It has not only lengthened our lifespans but also enhanced its quality. Fields of knowledge, experience and recreation that in the past were known only to a few have been thrown open to millions.
However, the Gifts of Modern Science Can Be Misused.
Through the work of science, ordinary man today has been given the opportunity of a longer and fuller life than was ever possible to his grandparents. Respectfully, we must acknowledge all that science has done and is doing for the welfare of our race, but the gifts of modern science can be misused.
The motor-driven vehicle facilitates business and gives harmless enjoyment to many, but it can strew the roads with more death an injury than this country has ever known in a year.
The cinema is a means of instruction and recreation, but it is often a channel of vulgarity and false values.
The Internet can link the world together in an instant, but it can also be the instrument of falsehood and propaganda. The airplane makes travel over great distances quick and easy.
It can also become a weapon of destruction. It is this two-fold aspect of the methods to which science can be applied that has raised a valid concern to most people.
It is morally justifiable to see a supposedly perfect invention a possible means of destruction.

Tea: an effective cure for breast cancer?
According to new research, three cups of tea a day
can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age, by more than a third.
In research carried out by the Moffitt Cancer Institute, in the American state of Florida, it was revealed that the risk of occurrence of breast cancer tumors in women below the age of 50 years
who drink at least three cups of tea a day is reduced by up to 37%.
It was also revealed in the research that there was no significant benefit, in these regards, in the woman aged above 50, who drank three or more cups of tea a day.
Experts believe that the reason for this is that tea has  ingredients in it which are more effective against specific tumors which generally occur in women below the age of 50.
The Moft Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, studied 5,000 women who had taken the treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 70 years.
The experts compared their medical records and lifestyle with those of women who have not been diagnosed with breast cancer.
The experts also found out that on a particular type of breast cancer called Lobular, tea had shown to prevent cancer by 66%.
Almost one in ten patients of breast cancer suffer from this type.
This type of cancer is more dangerous because it deep inside and is usually diagnosed when it has already spread to a great extent.
Experts say that by drinking at least three cups of tea a day, the danger of breast cancer can be reduced in young women.
They say that making tea a regular drink can cause great resistance in the body against breast cancer.
In Britain every year almost 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer.

Why the reduction of exercise with increasing age?
New research
Exercise is good at every age to remain healthy.
It makes your heart stronger, reduced Cholesterol levels, helps control weight, helps in limiting Diabetes and slows the Alzheimer's process.
Unfortunately, with many people with increasing age reduces the ability to exercise.
Experts says with exercise our body and brain remains alert yet aging can affect it.
According to American Medical Association if exercise is excluded from daily life there can be many health problems that can develop in the future.
Dr. Pattricia P. Leka of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says that increase in age is a big reason for being handicapped from exercise and other physical activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo clinic.
She headed a research study regarding heart disease and man's ability to do exercise in older age.
A team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart
in which it's activity of pumping blood and its contraction and relaxation was studied.
Researcher focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.
They came to know ,that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.
Dr. Patricia says with increase in age, problems occur in the activity of relaxation of heart and this effects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garvin Ken was also part of this research.
He says that they were surprised to see that it has an effect  and it confirmed that bad exercising ability is very much related to the heart relaxing activity.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause disorders in heart functions and heart disease.
If the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard, the patient can take advantage of the benefits of exercise regardless of age.
A detailed report on this matter is published in a magazine from the American Medical Association.
No Chances of an Immediate War with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief
Indian Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan. "However/ we are always ready to defend our country and sacrifice our lives for it," he said.
He has stated that even with commitments from other nations and international pressure on Pakistan as a result of Mumbai attacks, the infrastructure of terrorism is not only existent but also proactive in Pakistan.
He said this while talking to correspondents in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day tour to the valley of Kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in New Delhi-administered Kashmir and preparation of armed forces on the borders.
He was asked his thoughts on media reports that Pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from India regarding the Mumbai attacks.
General Kapoor said that the decisions of peace or war matters are made by the political leadership.
Mentioning the proven presence of a terrorist structure in Pakistan, he said that the Indian army would face such groups which are trying to disturb peace and are bent towards weakening India.
He said that in Kashmir, India, at least 700 to 800 militants are present, of which approximately half are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that with an improvement in the seasonal weather, there might be an increase in infiltration from Pakistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir. However, India has increased it's guard at the borders.
He refuted the possibility of decrease in the army posting in Kashmir, saying that there can be no compromise with regards to national security.
May Allah bless the tongues of the world and may Barack become a blessing for the world.
Though it was not expected, still we shall see how this change  will work out in our favor with regards to Pakistan-American relations.
And what Barack Obama, who is the result of Martin Luther Kings dreams, gives to the world.
Obama, whose middle name is Hussein, is taking the oath today to become the President of the United States of America.  This is not only a matter of historic importance, but also a historic test.
Not only for himself, but also for all the people who supported him.
It will even be a test for the white majority, who will have to fully accept an African American governing over them.  Which is no easy task.
Here in South Asia, especially the Muslims which have some expectations for Obama, should remember that Obama has been elected the President of America. Obama also should remember that for all practical purposes America is the ruler of whole world.
After a while, a person whose ancestors were slaves and came from different regions of the world is going to become the 44th president of America.
People have many expectations for this man.
Obama's fans should not expect something unrealistic from him.
If Obama becomes successful in decreasing the religious and racial acrimony, it will be a victory for his fans.
Will South Asia will be affected by this change, and can any meaningful change in American policies be expected?
How Pakistan and America's relationship will be affected by this change:
image not available
The presence of Obama, or others, does not matter because the real authority which decides policy and foreign relations is the strong Jewish lobby.
As far as Pakistan is concerned, after the Mumbai attacks the world saw the triad of America, India and Israel respond aggressively.
Even for a while, after Pakistan was formed, the managing of Swat was left to the government of Swat, which had it's own army and law.
They surrendered their rule to the government of Pakistan according to a treaty.
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a step mother.
There has been no increase in the number of schools in Swat since the rule of the Ruler of Swat was ended.
Nor was there any interest in construction and development over there.
The number of girls receiving education under the present rule is many times less than their number under the previous rule.
In the Sarhad state of Pakistan, the local Taliban have been targeting the educational institutions.
The most schools were destroyed in Swat province, of which the majority were girls schools.
Not only this, but the Taliban have announced the prohibition of girls education in Swat.
Thousands of boys and girls are being deprived of education.
What do you think the Taliban have to gain by eradicating the education of women?
Why has the government been unsuccessful in stopping these illegal steps?
What do you think the government should do?
The question should be, what do the ISI and Pakistani agencies get?
The public of Swat must have realized that this was a game and that the army was there to serve the Taliban, rather than to kill them. Otherwise, how could five schools have been blown up in a single curfew night? How could people have been slaughtered during curfew and hung in the main circle of the town?
When the government is not allowed to have any say in Swat, how can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps?
Now, the question arises as to why these four Taliban are not being controlled when the government has an armed military, new and dangerous weapons, a new spy system, and more.
The answer to this is that they have the hand of a hidden guide on their heads, because of which neither do their weapons get exhausted, nor do they get captured.
The conclusion is that the Taliban, via their dark activities, is making the work of the global leadership easier.
15 years ago, there was war in Afghanistan.
The ISI was controlling the Taliban, while the opposing side, the northern coalition was being aided by Russia, India, and Iran.
Suddenly the scenario changed, and the activities of the Taliban came into light.
The ISI also was offered financial aid by the Americans which resulted in past friends becoming foes.
Now the scenario is that the war is still raging but the supporters in Pakistan are still the same Iran, India, and Russia.
Until mankind can understand the difference between whats right and whats wrong he will always make the wrong decision.
For example, if a thief goes to perform a crime but just before he commits it he realizes that its a wrong thing to do and that robbing is a sin and that it is punishable, if he fears his Lord he will then not commit the crime.
In the same way until and unless Israel understands that it is doing the wrong thing by shedding the blood of innocent people in Gaza and that it'll be punished for as long as it continues to kill innocent people there.
Greetings!
The question is if war or aggression the answer to the Terrorist issue?
If not then what is that unique formula that can move us toward solving this issue?
It is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but rather give 'blessings' to them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development that Nelson Mandela used in South Africa.
That is: to struggle character wise and politically more than with arms.
Seeing the Kashmiris taking part in the elections, it looks as if they have accepted this view point.
It is the third week of Israeli attacks on Gaza, and the number of deaths have come close to a thousand.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date a ceasefire has not been possible.
According to another report, since the start of attacks on the 27th of December, 90,000 Palestinians have left their homes and moved towards safer locations.
Here aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, and said that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victims of grave psychological and emotional difficulties.
What do you say?
What should happen?
How can we maintain permanent peace in Gaza?

Give Taliban a Chance.
Basit, Peshawar
Wake up! If Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down girls schools?
They will be kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
These Taliban have damaged Islam so much that no other nation or religion has done.
Pushtun force
Kohat, Pakistan
If the entire Muslim world gets together and just threatens an attach on Israel, you will see how much Israel's ally, America will get hurt.
And not only will theere be immediate talks of ceasefire, an actual ceasefire will occur.
But what can be done?  Where can our leaders get so much courage from?
Someone should tell Ahmedinejad that he should take the lead, as BBC forum's are full of discussion of his braveness.
The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights falls not only upon the Arabs, or the Muslims of the world, but rather on all of the nations that speak up against oppression.
This troubling incident is one of Bush's worst misdeeds.
On June 30th, before the close of the financial year in Pakistan and India, the government institutions are looted, in the same way. Similarly, before the winding up of the American government, Israel was given the green signal to do whatever it wants.
America says that it will try for a ceasefire.
The United Nations is passing resolution after resolution but has been futile. This concludes to one idea that the United Nations supports Muslim oppression.
All Muslim countries should immediately revoke their United Nations membership and lay foundation for a united Muslim Union.
There are many evident examples in front of us. America and the United Nations only promises and passes resolutions. It is the Muslims in the end who suffer.
What is the use of such propaganda when BBC does not published the matter?
Where are all the ideals of journalism buried? When unjustified spillage of blood, especially Muslim blood, occurs and BBC takes a neutral position of not being a side to any party.
by the way is a flag bearer of rights
to raise voice is a far reality, the limit of hypocrisy is that it doesn't even publish the views
from the Muslim side
The only difference between you and the Jews is the latter call themselves Jews. They martyr Muslims and live amongst Muslims like you. They call themselves Muslims.
syja786
For a while, BBC forums have made a certain point. Sometimes this has occurred while discussing suicide attacks and other times, terrorism in India.
The most used word in these anti-Islamic comments is extremism.
But who is the extremist? That you can easily figure out from the above comment.
When will Muslims understand that Dajjal can not be fought with the sword?
Look at the helpless people facing the Israel bombings. If your heart does not cry tears of blood what does it do?
But the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that we try to use the name of Jihad to disfigure the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existence of Israel, what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks?
The conduct of both sides is misanthropist.
The action of the United Nations and the United States seem to be supporting the Israeli wrongdoings.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
And we should think about giving the real terrorists an anti-terrorism Nobel prize for their painstaking efforts against terrorism, as after all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, would it be possible for terrorism to take place at such a large scale without the support from some important leader? Everyone knows who is pulling the strings.
Frankly, these gangsters are told to do whatever they want.
What injustice! They are hit on the head, but not allowed to complain.
Arab leaders are providing medicine for the injured, helping with funeral costs and compensating families for the loss of their family members.
If Israel attacks, what should be done?
The actual problem is that the leaders of all the Muslim countries, including the Saudi king are in a deep sleep. They neither have an army nor any defensive strategies. They think they can fulfill their responsibility without such things.
They should take immediate action against Israel.
For instance, they could stop the sale of oil to Europe and America.
Salam to all sisters and brothers.
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is the same as them declaring defeat.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature.  The steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer, growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants don't realize.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Israel and Hamas should enter a truce so that the death and destruction can come to an end.
Mohammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France
Absolutely correctly stated.
Suppose that Hamas is 100% truthful, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah.  Even then, they should know that if a good deed results in the destruction of an established house, it is no longer a good deed.
For those who claim to love God, love the messenger, and love their religion, loving mankind is a part of their faith.
As if it is the order of Allah to wipe all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than Muslims.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
No, not to kill them, but rather the order is to invite them to Islam.
But those people who plan against the religion, Jihad will be performed against them.
To fight them until they stop their plans, but this  definitely does not mean that you wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the end result of killing innocent children is destruction.
I would like to tell my friends that yesterday the Israelis did not have any place for shelter, but today they have become so strong that they do not listen to anyone. This is because the Jews are united.
They do not have Shia, Sunni. They are all just Jews, and they have made everything for development.
On the other hand, what is the state of the 55 Islamic countries?
They are behind in every field, and now the situation is that they have become so helpless that the enemy is killing them and they are waiting to die.
All the Muslim countries need to get together and prepare an action plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
There is no better course of action then accepting Israel progress.  It is best to Learn new technologies and ways to be success and let the world live in peace.
Muslims also have great properties and resources.
They need to learn how to capitalize on their resources..
One of the Muslim people's greatest problems is that the Hammas and Alfatah can not be united.
The only reason to destroy great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin was to weaken the only nation fighting for Aqsa Mosque. And it was impossible until Yasir and Yasin were removed from the way.
The world has seen how Palestine was effected after the death of these two leaders.
Now the jews are able to strengthen their positions in the land with every passing minute.
In 1974, a Pakistani Prime minister had such influence that he was able to assemble all of the Muslim leaders under one roof.  These leaders were so united that for the first time in history they obtained 100% attendance.
Today, on his 81st birthday, The country can not even come together to decide weather it even wants to unite as one!
more over by resolving Muslims conflicts (Islamic common wealth establishment) will give plunge to its uncompleted mission.
this is that jinn which lap to Palestinian since more than half century
Jinn has many faces.
many time this jinn on his some other face give a bad remarks for his own self to turn back worlds pressure and concentration.
and this jinn other face eating peoples in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
and this jinn have a big fear of Islam, as this jinn knows that when ever he pull out this only and only by Islam Muslims and Muslims complete religion and act of Islam pull out because history said that Islam put on right track many biggest Abujahal.
Israeli fighter jets started bombing Gaza and begin launching missile attacks on the 27th of December.
In this attack more than three hundred residents died.
After the air attacks, Israeli tanks and bulletproof vehicles prepared for war via land and reached Gaza.
The United Nations Security council had an emergency gathering asked for immediate stop of the violent activities between Israel and Palestinian.
Israel official said that they will continue action in Gaza until the rocket attacks on Israel end.
What should Israel do in order to defend them self? Will their action work?
What is the international community to do?
What does this action have to do with Israels upcoming next election?

BBC publishes and actively searches for the comments.
They have to keep the perception of non-alignment.
The news on BBC is usually true but the main issue is their tone.
In the news what should be highlighted and what should be given less importance.

Zaheer Chughtai
Pakistani Wire-net media in particular some of the columnists and newspapers are not far behind.  They are writing with courage against the growing extremism, terrorism and stressing upon "Muawiyah hate."
He said that the United Nations, speaks of human rights and peace, but allows Muslims to be greatly oppressed.  The UN says they will continue their unfair policy until Hamas stops it's attacks.
Why Muslims are getting abused, If People like American will leave the back support of Jews then Allah has said clearly that this caste will spend there life contemptible and this caste can not spend there life good,  if American Citizens have the guts to leave the Back support of Jews then see the Fortune of the life of Jews
The People who are killing and murdering people in the name of peace and justice they have to understand this clearly that in this world peace will come only and only by administer an Oath not by doing injustice and semination
If only by doing semination u can kill the caste and withdraw the results what you want then after Hitlers Measure, not only the Jews caste was continued but in one way the ascent as today was impossible
In the Words of Poet
Abuse is again an abuse if its get higher it will be erased
Blood is again a Blood if it falls down it will Freeze
Now who will say to whom that what is Terrorism?
Why this all does not comes under Terrorism, why only our pain is seems to be like every ones pain
Why the other people are not the human beings or only Muslims blood has become so cheap, these many innocents blood was not red in color
Now from any where why the condolence message is not coming?
I watched the Mumbai incident, and felt as if my own house was on fire. The sorrow of those affected was overwhelming. If only there was a solution to this war.
Words cannot fully describe the sight of the corpses that littered the street.
I feel like crying about the helplessness of Muslims, because on one side, people are dying in India, and on the other side the whole world seems to be against Pakistan.
Israel is ruthlessly killing Muslims and the whole world is silent. This is unbearable.
God may delay, but He will not abandon.  All troubles will eventually pass.
There is no danger to Isreal as long as America is present.
There is no doubt that to gain public support, elections will have to take place, especially in a state like Israel. As for Barack Obama, history is witness that no American ruler has been able to go against the American people and nor will they go. Whether the ruler is white or black, he is still a ruler.
From the discussions going on in the forum, it seems that everyone is saddened by her death.  However, her political mistakes have not been forgotten.
This issue as to whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power is debatable.
If democracy was important, why did she leave Musharraf in control of the republic for ten years, waiting to make a deal with the Americans?
Benazir didn't come to Pakistan when the people needed her the most, unfortunately she only came to Pakistan when she had to deal with cases and was promised a seat of power.
The blame that is being laid down on historical figures hasn't been addressed by anyone.

Ladies and gentlemen, due to studying the history in not only Pakistan but in its four friend nations and seven other nations, you will find the arguments of Mr Psycho more appealing.

How merciless is our nation. We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.    How merciless is our nation? We are blind when we write in favor of ourselves and our party, however not one person  says a word when every historical intellectual is being critiqued and blamed.

Some things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar if you en wreathe him with books.    When we think nothing can be done to change things, we ignore the issues.   You can't make an ass any smarter by surrounding him with books.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks but Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.    After the Bombay attacks, talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted.  It is in the best interest of both countries for these talks to resume.
If they talk about war then both the sides will suffer human loss.    If they go to war, both countries will suffer the loss of human life.
India says that Pakistani citizen is caught in Bombay attacks. And he has written and sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. But earlier, when India caught this extremist, said that he is a smart engineer but later they declared him to have studied only four grades. This is what has to be considered.    The extremist arrested by India in the Bombay attacks is said to be a Pakistani citizen.   The extremist was reported to be an engineer, but was later found to have only completed four years of schooling.
Merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and all Christian members of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.    Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all members of the forum.
We do not want the flames of fire; but the flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
Will war give a solution to our problems?
It will be blessed with fire and blood.
It will give hunger and exigence.
Therefore wise humans
It's better to avoid war.
In our yard.
It's better that the glim keeps lightened
The India-America relations have deepened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
This is the history of America.
In the case of an Indian attack, America's goals will be fulfilled, and the expenses will be India's.
Pakistan should clearly announce that it will not start a conflict, but if a conflict is caused, there will be no talks of peace or truce. The war will not stop until India is completely destroyed or captured, even if it involves our own destruction.
This is Islamic history.
Before the resolution, the message that had to be given by the public and the army was released.
In compensation for the Mumbai attacks, the abnormal diplomatic and military benefits that India tried to gain, made it more a victimizing party, than a victim. That is why, in contrast to the harsh initial global reactions, the world has now reduced their force on Pakistan.
The satisfaction expressed by the United Nations over Pakistani efforts and the praise by the Interpol leader of Pakistani efforts, in disregard of India's commotion, shows the side effect of India's more than necessary diplomacy.
There is no argument about the brutality of these actions.
But the question is, when thousands of Taliban were attacking Pir Samiullah's town, where were the Pakistani Army, and what were they doing?
Should the army not be taken into account, for what they did there in a year?
How many Taliban die each day due to their firing of thousands of mortar and canon shells?
I appeal to the ICI that they stop their guardianship of the Taliban, for God's sake, and let us live peacefully in paradise like Swat,
and that they stop this fixed operation.
The day is not far when a resolution will be passed in the United Nations against army intervention in Pakistan, the same way as it was passed against Jama'athud-Da'wah.
Riyaz Ahmad Farooqi
First of all, our radicalism and our protecting them, is alone, sufficient to provide complete proof and permissibility for action against us. And the very day such a resolution is passed, there is all probability that no voice will be raised in our support, in the United Nations.
And supposing the passing of such a resolution is delayed, some other strength will definitely leave our aid to ourself,, keeping the example of America in front of them.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
The bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah, and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are deathless even after being dead.
But here, an international game is being played. Here ferociousness  and animosity are created to do the ruling.
So there can be reasons created. That if we are not here then these vandals and animals can come take over the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
America sees the torture of these extremists, but instead of being sad on these faithless activities, they easily name them as tribal culture.
The reason for these faithless activities, sometimes given in the name of tribal culture and other times in the name of Islam, is not something done by a person with a heart.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so brave that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also men of God and so is our army.
It is very clear that there is something fishy.
Instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and punitive occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion, was seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell!
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said, that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose not to know about it.
Who burnt the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on her refusal of oath after the Prophet (PB-UH) passed away and who took her husband's life with the rope in his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
Was the attack on Medina by the Army of Yazid, and the incident of Karbala the conspiracy of Jews and Pagans?
Without accepting the facts, neither motives can be removed nor can they be corrected.
BBC people, stop this dual policy.
A better super hit title than this is:  The Beating  of Bush with Shoes: Right or Wrong?
This should have been the topic.
Tahir Chowdary, Japan
Be ashamed, the body of a person was taken out of the grave and hanged on a pole because he spoke against the cruelty and you are struck up over the topic of Box Office.
The success of operation Sherdil, and across the border the success of operation Lion Heart depends on the direction of sympathies of common folk.
This step of American and Pakistani intelligence agencies and Pir Sahib is the victim of this conspiracy.
All the comments on this forum would be against the Taliban because intelligence agents have successfully infiltrated in the Taliban ranks and they are carrying out such actions that can change their perception of people.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public? They even report things like this "Bombing on Taliban Residences", and "A Shell Falling on a House Kills Two Children and Their Mother".
Did they not know about this mistake?
Were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000, in Swat went there to do.
The bodies of the Taliban members who help the army are left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC, did not do any good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake, stop this drama.
These Taliban members have tarnished the Muslim image.
If, around the world, true Muslims don't call these terrorists Muslims, then why are these elements able to live in the lands of true Muslims?
Those who become shameless can't do hard labor, and they pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
No religion or family tradition allows this.
All the media, incl present their views on the Taliban or the tribal people in different styles.
No one, other than us tribal people, are aware of the ground realities, what the truth is, and what really is the matter.
In short, it's a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a Talib or a tribal. Warmongers, who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions, made these institutions.
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute the leader of MQM, Althaf Husain, and the leaderships of ANP and PPP, as they have spoken against this cancer,that is, the Taliban.
This cancer was given birth to by Zia-ul-Haqq. He has gone, but he destroyed Pakistan as he went.
I have hope, however, that the present government will eradicate this cancer.
After the Mumbai attacks, India had said that there was the hand of Pakistani extremists behind the attack.
Pakistan refuted these claims and said that it would help India in investigations in every possible way.
India said that they have given Pakistan a list of the suspected extremists which India wanted.
Now, Pakistan said that the Jaish-e-Mohammad leader, who is included in the list, Moulana Mas'ood Azhar, is not under house arrest, and furthermore that the government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Previously, the President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari had rejected the idea that western intelligence agencies and the Indian government had provided Pakistan proof about the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said, in regards to Ajmal Kasab, that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
At that time, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that their relationship with India could not improve as long as their land continues to be used for terrorism.
In the latest developments, the Indian cricket team canceled their tour of Pakistan.
Should these political events affect sports?
What do you see the future of India-Pakistan relations looking like?
Neither America nor India will be what break Pakistan.
Pakistan will simply break itself.
With so much regionalism, so many different factions, and infiltration, what else can you expect?
Time has proved that Jinnah did no good for the Indian Muslims.
Yasmin, Chicago
Madam, if work was continued in Jinnah's manner the tumors of regionalism, factionism and infiltration would not have spread in Pakistan, nor would the Indian Muslims have been treated in this way.
But it is our own fault that we couldnt produce a leader of similar stature.
If we can't respect our leaders then
There are many worthy people in this part of the world.
God knows when some sense will return to the people and when the blessing of Consensus in opinion will help improve this area.
In both countries the Mullahs, Pundits, Taliban, Shiv Sena, the RSS, etc have been established to oppose the progression of peace.
Destructive forces don't want this area to improve, and for this, these countries are manipulated like puppets.
Can you imagine, with the aid of Consensus between Pakistan, India, and China, what position they would have in the world?
It is Gods' punishment that positioned thieves, robbers, and manipulators as leaders of this country.
May God protect Pakistan from any harm, Amen.
But sir, open your eyes and look around. See the current situation and ground realities that reveal the extent to which the American have progressed.
Moreover, the internal affairs don't seem to be good, as you can see the circumstances in NWFP, Balochistan and in Karachi in Sindh.
In this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
Oh Allah, bestow your mercy upon us.
According to my understanding, a final war is inevitable.
This is enough of it.
Now it should be do or die.
This problem can not be solved through these acts of insincere dialogues.
And not through small scale terrorism in each other's country.
After all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
And if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all of our political parties agree on this matter that these terrorist and denominational activities should be terminated from the country.
But our army rule does not seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, American and Europe are made to believe that we are with you on this war against terrorism and the other hand, we also help Taliban secretly.
We have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way. Thank you.
There is no doubt in this that majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are the members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined  the party  named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.
Although these members preferred subsidiary activities and now after India's great persistence, The United Nation has invalidated it also and Government of Pakistan is continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it is better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
Terrorist groups present in Pakistan, who support professional criminals and the heads of those Mullahs are those who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.
And now they are doing everything to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan from these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous persons or not?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose only work is to kill.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What kind of world is this where it is hard to live for one who takes the name of one major pillar of Islam, the religion of Allah?
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims but when Muslims even try to take revenge, all our hypocrite leaders together with all the non-Muslim world treat people with the true and right pain of religion just like our great leader Hafiz Saeed is being treated today.
India is in impunity of the Bombay attacks.
Pakistan relations are bitter. A better relationship could be had as a result of the last few years between the two countries having been jolted greatly.
India has always held the military and non-military groups in Pakistan responsible.
Bringing relationships back on track is being conducted by operations against these groups.
Indian security departments have held Lashkher-e-Tayyaba responsible for the Bombay attacks.
In this way many times Jamat Ul Dawa's name came up.
This was not first time that terrorism caused intense relations between two countries.
On December 2001 after the attack on Indian parliament these two neighbors came to the front of the war.
And afterwards put sanction against Luskaray Taiba and included it in a list of terrorist organizations.
Now on Jamat UL Dawa , about which security analyst said that this is the new face of Laskaray Taiba, asking for sanctions.
What is your suggestion? Should this group sanction or not?
Should Pakistan need to take action against terrorist groups on its land?
Does put sanction on Jamat Ul Dawa present India
Pak crisis could resolve and for real peace in between two countries how important is that to finished groups who have weapons?
United Nations Security Assembly put sanctions against Jamat Ul Dawa. And,last, what evidence does Security council have to shows that much hurry?
Public Tranquility Council will always never show this much of expertness against Muslims?
This we say as Accuser is Weak and witness is Strong!
India has make itself a disappointing country.
Whom so ever Intelligence, Military and other Security Departments has been disappointed, only few terrorists has made them to dance for 72 hours and now India on his disappointment they are blaming Pakistan for this and trying to ruse the whole world
If one non-Muslim is murdered then the voices will be raised from whole world. Why is there this double standard?
To my Dearest Countries one and only non politics, Religious, Cultural Organization -----------
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
Till the time Prophet PBUH, Saints and the Follower has given the respect to the Human beings, With Peace the Religion Islam was advertised a lot and was going on.
Muslims have had success in every land.
When this beautiful religion has come to a normal person then the human beings has started differentiating the Muslim and non Muslim and then the new chapters of tumults and quarrel has been started, earlier the world was not aware of this.
Do greet them sir. But at your own expense.
Don't do it under the pressure of America.
If India has any complaints, then it should come up with evidence.
Why don't they do so?
Why do they blame everything on us?
Extremist groups are also present in India, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the world?
How can India explain its actions in Kashmir?
And what of the actions of Israel?
The truth is that we are the first nuclear Islamic state in the world and that is the cause of all the hatred.
Pakistan is in its final stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart and circumstances also seems to be such
American magazines are boldly printing the new map of Pakistan, and all these sanctions seem to be part of this conspiracy.
Americans are swiftly tightening their grip over Pakistan.
If Bangladesh can be created, we, as a nation, must remember its example and display unity and solidarity.
Any act of terrorism should be condemned whether it is in a Mumbai hotel, a Marriott Hotel in Islamabad or in Palenstine itself.
Ignoring the nationalities of the terrorists, they all should be eliminated no matter if they are Pakistanis, Indians, Americans or Israelites.
The question is: Why is the entire world, including Pakistani officials, silent on terrorist attacks that occur daily in Pakistan and kill hundreds of people?
Was the attack on the Marriott Hotel a terrorist act?
Then why?
Praise the worthy Advisor interior,Mister Rehman Malik,by the grace of God, how brave he has become!

Not only this , according to the BBC Mister Malik has also tried to negate this impression with full strength that all these imprisonments are being carried out on whose orders.
Praise the lord!
Having this capability or not, this I don't want to say.
Whose war we Pakistanis are fighting
and why. We have our own priorities which we shall protect with our full strength.
Nobody has an authority to interfere in any other country.
Apparently colonial period does not seem to exist.
If people are expecting justice, then they should empower law-enforcement agencies, should respect the democratic  institutions, and should not help dictators or any military personal. Then Pakistan, a 3rd world country, can attain   peace that would be unacceptable for the Extremist groups.
Pakistan is already in favor of the European Union and America.
The majority of groups in Pakistan are against this favor.
This promotes more opposition.
If America and its allied forces should leave Pakistan and believe in democracy, then the people will start supporting the sovereignty by stopping their protest.
Pakistan is capable of deciding the issues by either dialogues or by arms.
Pakistani forces occupying Kashmir raided one of the camps of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba.
After the Mumbai attacks, the pressure is on Pakistan to increase the operation against Extremist Organisations.
India claims to be involved with the Mumbai attacks on Lashkar-e-Tayyaba.

It is their claim that without a doubt, the extremists who carried out the Mumbai attacks used Pakistani land.
In the meanwhile, officials in Peshawar claim that the lot of trucks which carry supplies to the united forces in Afghanistan was burnt by unidentified armed people, because of which more than 50 trucks were destroyed.
This is the second attack in Peshawar on NATO and American supplies in the last 48 hours.
In the meanwhile, Pakistan captured an established camp of the almost inexistent Lashkar-e-Taiba. Previously, lots of efforts were carried out to try to disarm the armed groups all the way from Karachi to the tribal regions, which included giving compensation to those who returned their weapons and even ascertaining them that no action would be taken against them.
The situation is telling us that the efforts undertaken in the regime of General Ziyaul Haqq, after the previous Soviet Union's interference in Afghanistan to get rid of the armed groups that formed as a result of the resistance that started through American and Saudi funding, and to bring an environment similar to that before 1980 was not successful.
The question is what does Pakistan want to do?
Does Pakistan have the ability to do so?
What do you say?

I have only one question from all humanitarian leaders.
You murder their children and they bring garlands for you?   That's impossible.

Knowledge of East and West, is there any logic, reason or philosophy which allows killing of innocent people including Namazi, laborers and poor service men in the revenge of American attacks?
If your answer is no, then you need to correct your point of view.
People were armed because there was a danger of Russia coming towards Pakistan after Afghanistan.
Now when the danger is that America can attack Pakistan from the channel of Afghanistan, which was mentioned directly in the presidential campaign by the president himself. Then why should he unarm these people?
Just because America and India will not have to face any public resistance after defeating Pakistan army.
Yes, if any of them are involved in terrorist activities, then only Pakistan should take action against them.
The sad fact of the matter is that the leaders of Lashkare Tayyaba declared the accusations of India that Pakistan was involved are correct.
Najeeb Ur Rehman Psycho *Lahore*
Even if this is accepted that Lashkare Tayyaba is involved, still the blame cannot be placed on the Pakistani Government.
Another question arises as to whether or not these terrorists have the aid of some government or non-government employee of India.
Are the terrorists born or made only in Pakistan, and not in India or other nations of the world?
As far as Laskare Tayyaba is concerned, it has no involvement in the recent incidents.
It should be kept in mind that Hafiz Saeed was the first Jihadi leader who claimed that the actions of the Taliban were a Fitna.
I believe without a doubt that all the actions of the Taliban were an integral part of the American scheme, therefore it is necessary to eradicate anyone and everyone who stands in the way of Taliban.
Despite the co-operation of the entire nation, launching an operation under the pressure of India shows the stature and non-existant leadership qualities of Zerdari and company.
The operations started with American and Saudi funding has to come to an end and to do so it should be requested of them that for god's sake wipe out this filth that is consistently polluting our society.
And also protest against them asking them based on what ethics, America and Saudi spread dangerous weapons and so called Jihadi, but in reality hate inciting and cultural virus enticing literature in our country, because of which our country has become a human slaughterhouse.
After facing the risk of attack from India, the Pakistani Army's announcement that it would remove forces from the Afghan border and post them at the Indian border, and the announcement of the Taliban that it would handle the Afghan border, caused America to stumble, and pressurize India not to attack Pakistan.
This showed the strength of America in the region.
However, India did not warn that they would attack, nor do they have that much courage.
The Taliban attacked and depleted most of the remaining American supplies.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and the Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi is the trade and financial center of Pakistan, and the Dubai of the backward regions.
Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty handed, but ever since the law and order situation in the western border regions was lost, all people diverted their attention here.
Now they want to kidnap this city.
For the first time, Pathans began to be called Pukhtons, and the people of a single town are made foreigners and are being made to fight, while the need is for unity.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speaking learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu. It's better that everybody learns English.
You must be thinking it's a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also amusing?
That the cause of the torture would be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir in my childhood I had actually gave the same suggestion many times to my friends which included people from every religion and rhetoric groups, but these people used to laugh over these suggestions.
At that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not as apparently alive and powerful on the surface but they were boiling inside.
It's hard to understand what is happening and why.
Are these the signs of the Judgement Day?
What are these innocent and obnoxious people being killed for?
The reason is in front of everyone: the ones who want to break Pakistan into pieces are active and those who do all this neither belong to any one religion nor a country.
Be it Karachi or Mumbai, houses are set on fire by its own residents. (this is an phrase used to say that the inhabitants to the city destroying their own city)
Which ever government comes to power changes the name of important infrastructure projects like airports, major roads,and buildings. Presently this is the case and buildings, airports etc have been renamed as Baynazeer (name of a very famous political leader of Pakistan assassinated during a public speech)
Does Baynzeer means what is going on with the people of Karachi and Pakistan ?
While the Mumbai attack was at its peak, the initiative taken by RAW(Indian spy agency)to start sectarian violence was busted and this event proves that in past political figures on RAW's payroll have now given up the job.
Spilling of innocent blood of Pushto speaking people and by India threatening many a times, have waked up the Pakistani's from Karachi to Khyber.
The strict applause of anger from political, religious, sectarian and national bodies is now teaching India the manners of diplomatic speech. They have provided American strategists a chance to think again.
Those responsible for the turmoil in Karachi are Mutahida and Awami National Party, ANP , as the establishment is inclined towards one party and not neutral.
The establishment could had controlled the events in an hour but intentionally allowed to the event to escalate.
Police and rangers abstained from taking any action since they were under pressure from political parties.
The talks about a unity among political parties on the issue is limited to paper only. Parties will have to forgo their own vested interests and work for the interests of a common man
Until pressure is put on the administration, these kinds of incidents will keep taking place.
I think these people are terrorists.
Foreign powers are definitely involved in this, but no one knows who they are.
If these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there?  Because it's not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
The government should operate here and save a large and very important city from terrorism.
otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
BBC Urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure, and Pakistani media's condition is already weak.
The whole truth is on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that either Urdu speakers should learn Pushto, or Pushto speaking learn Urdu, or better if every body learns English.
You will definitely take this as a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
Was language the reason for violence?
There was another terrorist attack reported from Karachi, the repercussions of which will be felt by every citizen for a long time.
It seems that wherever possible, they did as much damage as possible.  The media is reporting only half of what has happened in the last four days.
I've been awake for four nights and I'm still afraid.
They've evacuated hotels.  Cobblers and peanut sellers have been killed.
Those who destroyed the highway and are cutting of the ears of civilians are not aware of the punishment of Allah, who will come down on them some day.
In your opinion, what are the reasons for this sudden disturbance?

If you look at the attacks in Bombay, you don't have to look far to find the reason for this distrubance in Karachi.  But there is one simple reason.  This attack was the result of wanton bloodlust.
It is evident that if some one will knock kneed with the father, it is not unusual for the son to get out of control.
The blood of Liyaqath Ali Khan and many other brave hearts was also from there. I am writing this poem to get rid of Saiko's misunderstanding.
We will also repeat the traditions of the elders.
They gave their lives to build, we will give our lives to save.
Faizan Touseef Siddiqi
It is very sad that we are fighting each other at a time when the whole country is under attack.
I tell Mr. Siddiqi that if he checks Wikipedia.org for Liyaqath Ali Khan, then he will know that he was from a repectable Punjabi family, in the Karnal region of Punjab district.

Because of his efforts for immigrants, today the immigrants call him on of their own.
Every action has a reaction.
One can bear one's self, but...
Consequences of noises.
Many of those who live in large towns and cities have grown used to living with noises that come from several different sources.  Among those noises is the noise of moving trains, which is heard at almost all hours of the day.
The jet planes that fly overhead produce noises that are louder and more intense than the trains.
Many people have no time to think of noises as one type or another.
They become part of our daily lives.
There is something to be thought of, does noise affect our lives in any harmful ways?
There is evidence that it does so in several ways.  It has been recognized for a long time to do such.
Exposure to high intensity noise can lead to loss of hearing.  There have been cases of boiler-makers, for example, who suffer from occupational deafness.
Recently it has also been found that people who are continuously exposed to loud noises require protection for their ears.
If we live in industrial areas, which are growing with every passing year, there is the deafening noise produced by the speakers in houses or shops, radio sets in the neighborhood, and even school children at play or at chorus practice.
MQM is i coalation with government, Muslim League(N) is secret partnership with government and Muslim League(Q) is the party that passed 17Th ammendment, then how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17Th Amendment
This is the way to get one's name entered in the list of martyrs by just getting painted.
The Peoples' Party is otherwise not in hurry to end the seventeenth ammendment.
How any one can think of getting his own hands cut.
Seventeenth Ammendment cannot be abolished till Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of majority in one of our survey and it is also correct.
Zardari would not have opted to be the President, if seventeenth ammendment was to be abolished.
Now he is more powerful than President Musharraf, since along with President he is also  the chairman of Peoples Party.
The seventeenth ammendment will be there as long as he is the president.
Political Parties will have to remove President Zardari first, in order to abolish  the seventeenth ammendment.
This is not the will of MQM nor of other parties.
In our family, most of us are of workers.
And in our childhood, when we saw our uncles toil, we wished in our hearts that Allah would save us from hard physical labor.
To save ourselves from this, we wrote a letter to the editor of the Amroz daily, asking him what we could do to save ourselves from this toil.
In reply, the editor told us to become a doctor or engineer and take this and that in school.
My focus was always on engineering, and after metric, instead of Biology, I took Technical Drawing.
But while entering the FSC, my older brother forced me to do my FSC in medicine and become a doctor.
I studied biology for a month with great difficulty, and when I still couldn't understand anything, I took math as a subject instead.
So fear of labor made me an engineer, and today I am in very good condition compared to many of my peers, for which I am always thanking Allah.
I remembered this when I was trying to lift the carpet of my old house along with my two young sons.
It was not half an hour since we started working, that the younger son said "Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job."
We said, "If that is true, then study a lot, like we did, and free yourself from physical labor."
The son said "I am studying, and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work."
Anyway, the three of us finished that work in three hours and returned.
My purpose of saying this is that if a person has set a goal, whatever be the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving his goal.
But if you do not even know what you have to do, then Allah alone is your protector.
They say that you should not speak badly about the dead, but what can I do? Even one year after Benazir's death, I can only see faults in her.
For her own personal interest, Benazir handed over the list of Sikhs who were fighting for independence to India, and by doing so crushed the Sikhs independence movement and also allowed India to transfer its complete attention to Pakistan, having taken care of the Punjab movement.
The Russian wars that took place during the regimes of Benazir and Nawaz Sherif have become a part of history, which pushed the country many years back.
Benazir continued to speak ill about Kashmir and the atomic program throughout her exile.
Benazir Bhutto struck a deal with Musharraf which went against her London Treaty with Nawaz Sharif.
In her era,Benazir allowed her husband to openly earn money, which is why he came to be known as Mr. Ten Percent.
In Benazir's era, her brother was killed, and his killer is still not been punished.
Even though she was a woman, Benazir avoided fighting for women rights.
In a way similar to how Benazir did politics on her father's corpse, her widower husband is now doing politics on her corpse.
Benazir came to power twice. She brought the people guilty for the political killing of her father to justice, but she could not even file a case against them.
It has been 37 years since East Pakistan was separated from us, and look at the height of insensitivity on the part of the public and the rulers. No one ever mourned or expressed sorrow over their mistakes.
We should have been observing December 16th as a day of reflection and made plans to prevent the re occurrence of such incidents.
We should have been sending greetings to the people of Bangladesh on this day to bring them closer to ourselves.
The ruler should have opened the Jamudur Rahman commission file and pondered over the causes of separation of West Pakistan, which is mentioned therein.
We send gifts to the people in Bangladesh who are sick or in trouble, to help them and motivate them to plan their safe return.
We are numb. Our neighbors have died and we don't even know about it
We don't care about our brothers and sisters because we are selfish.
There is a big crisis. But we got over it and returned to our normal routines.
As East and West Germany reunite, I wish East and West Pakistan would follow suit.
We can be one again, if we care for each other and overcome  our selfishness.
It seems this wish can't come true in the near future.
Today's news reported that the Governor of Illinois was arrested for corruption.
In order to remove him from the office of Governor, the State Legislature is preparing to start a trial against him as soon as possible. One of our friends, who has a keen eye on the current affairs of Pakistan, proudly said that this is democracy.
In the USA, every man is equal under the law.
And there is your country, whose President was made after he had the corruption charges dropped.
We felt our nerve of wit and said, "what if a governor was arrested in America?  In our Pakistan our Prime Minister was once arrested during the night and was hanged.
Tell me if anything like this has happened in America.
Pakistan awarded Guard of Honor and bid farewell from the President's house, who broke the law of the country. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America.
Chief Justice of Pakistan was laid off in such a way that even after the nations support, he has not yet been reinstated. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America.
In Pakistan, a fake degree holder was appointed as Health Minister. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America.
After listening to this, the poor American could not stop laughing and also accepted defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by Americans from all sides.
It seems from his smile
America is with his government. But he is forgetting that last year, the same people were with Parvez Musharaf.
This picture was passed on as if it showed a family.
Previously, this photo showing the president with three American agents had never been printed in newspapers.
It seems that America has increased its work in Pakistan and thus either requires more than one agent to complete it or does not trust the new slave as much as they trusted the original one.
It is also possible that this was done with President Zardari's notoriety for breaking promises in mind.
If he was a truly smart ruler, he would not have shown his teeth in the photo, or at least would have appeared ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he wore.
If the rules of democracy are applied to this photo, President Zardari is in the minority.
The majority rules the country according to democracy, yet who is in this majority according to the photo?
Paradise-like Swat is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
The government's tactics so far have included discussions along with force.
But the use of force is only causing the Taliban to increase their own use of force while gaining more of the public's favor.
It is required that the government eliminate the causes of this problem rather than use force against them.
By elimintaing the causes, Fazlullah and the Taliban will be finished themselves.
The proposed Shariah bill of the ANP government will become a moderate solution to the problems in SWAT valley.
But alongside the establishment of the Shariah, the government will also have to take care of the economic problems.
From General Musharraf's initial few steps, it looked as if the nation would be free of useless politicians, but the love for power changed all his plans.
Whatever expectations were after joining the 'war of terror', he began to consider himself irrevocable.
And whatever steps were expected, were no more.
Just as Bush's rule began to close, he started to worry about the end of his own rule, and he struck a deal with the thieves in the dark.
Even then, General Musharraf could have commanded the army, but the present government does not even know what is happening.
Whether in Bajod or Swat, the army cannot control terror, and instead they bomb 'The Enemy', i.e. The Public. Apart from loss of life and money, if they are making 'The Enemy' psychologically ill, then we are the enemies, aren't we?
The conditions in the  terrorism struck area of Swat, in the Frontier Province, are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area
On tone side, the governments writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side the effect of Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everday in Swat.
On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.
The result is that on the one side, the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other hand, the Taliban has established their hold.
In between, who got grinded? The poor citizens.
It is said that in Swat somebody asked, which type of people are the Taliban are? The answer was  ""very good people because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country"".
Then asked how is the army, the answer was that the army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.
Then it was asked, who are the enemies of religion and country, the answer was it's citizens.
I am astonished, how the Pakistan Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban's.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
But still, the FM channel is spreading poison with vigor.
First the girls' schools and now boys' schools are being destroyed.
Curfews are called so that the Taliban can move around easily.
During curfew tonight, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
The question arises as to how they got there despite the curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone convince the army to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the army can defeat any enemy.
You say that mostly blood is spilled in the world because of religion. Tell me, if there was no religion today, would all this killing not take place?
Are Punjabi, Pathan, White, Black, Mahsood and other tribes the result of religion?
No, sir, no way! Only religion teaches that there is no black and white, there is no Punjabi and no immigrant. If it was not for religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between races, and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribe-brotherhood hatred.
Actually, only religion trains man's character and restricts him, as he has not come here on his own will, but rather the Creator of all that exists sent him here, and he must live here according to His commands.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France, for two years, I also felt the same way.
I do not know why people only expect us to call.
A resolution about Iraq, passed in a few hours, to send a 'peace' force to Darfur is not at all a problem.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where there is a matter of death, we are still holding meetings about that.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
Is it true that every one is waiting for it's end?
So that no other victim will even think about using a destructive weapon like a sling shot to fight for his rights?
Doesn't your heart ache a little; when a father is running holding his son's dead body?
If not; then you have no right to be called a human being.
But you are a shame to the name of humanity.
At least this was proven that this area was also Israel's country for thousands of years.
What should happen is that both the nations should live together happily and with love. But since they are controlled by the west and Arab countries; peace can not be formed here with out their consent.
Even Iran wants to fight it's proxy war here now.
Even if operations in Israel are stopped for the time being; they will start again after some other incident.
The interest of BBC's country is subject to the bestowing of America and Israel. This is the reason why in the name of "enlightenment" they have come with a series of blogs based on "darkness"; doing one-way and a blind propaganda.
BBC is just doing formality and to gain sympathy is their only purpose and wish.
Mr. Moderator is requested so he may publish the commentary by this humble soul so that one can guess BBC still has some integrity left.
Thank you.
Who knows about the author and the origin of this story but the fact remains, in every era Draculas have fed on innocent blood?
Every era has seen war as well as blood shed.
Surprisingly twenty-first century man who considers himself very civilized is silent over this murder done publicly in the day light.
How can he not realize that whatever is happening is showing the ugliest face of humanity?

At this time, along with Dera Ghazi Khan, in whole country winter rains are going on.
Presented is a poem according to the season. Enjoy the rain along with this poem.
Even these rains are from you
which when fell, brings spring.
When it stops there is no movement
sometimes it came just like that, without a reason.
Sometimes it spread day and night.
sometimes loudly, sometimes silently.
Even these rains are  from you
in some remembrance of night
on some suppressed ashes
Sometimes we blew out the flames.
Sometimes we burnt ourselves.
Sometimes every drop is like pain.
And these rains are only because of you.
All these leaders are going to run away with their briefcases in hand, what do they care about what will happen to the country?
Let the population sell toothpaste or clean the bells of the Mandir with the peels of lemons.
Our media is also fraudulent like our leaders.
The purpose of it is to get money out of the government, and nothing else.
And as far as the population goes, they can remain stupid because talking about them would be an even bigger stupidity.
Yesterday a strange incident took place.
All together, police running here and there but not asking about illegal parking
and moreover NYPD was not in a mood to look at illegally parked cars.
It happened like this. A plane from US Air landed in Hudson river.
Till now, it was just known that the "Terrorists" relation was with geese.
Yesterday New York's historic cold
temperature did not drop to this degree.
My jaw is beginning to hurt after a half hour of strolling outside.
Imagine what would have happened to those people who jumped from the plane into the river.
Happy news is that people all stayed safe
and the sad news is that ship sank in this financial crisis.
I reached New Jersey from the West siteand also saw that south bound is closed and still what have I done?

We considered the Taliban group of Swat nonreligious, and they were only against education of women.
His showing of disappointment every day played a part in damaging the school and the College of Women.
Today, the holy day of Monday, this theory was thwarted by a CNN report that the Taliban used dynamite to demolish a boys' school.

Just before this, the wedding between a dog and a girl took place.
Look at that groom.
Humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
It is the era of computers and its involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life.
Many people have reservations over this increasing involvement of the computer in financial matters.
Where use of credit cards bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
So that now, you can be located by transactions from your credit card.
And in future when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent, its benefits will increase more and more.
Similarly in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, it is easier to steal credit card information.
Similarly computers have become the source of friendship.
Social networking websites like orket, facebook and myspace have the first accepting level.
But is it not come to your mind that as we obey these social networks we are being away from the people in act.
So, this way you have been seen your wanted people and their index in the match making website.
Now can you spend your life with a person like you?
I can not spend and for this the wife is also called half body.
That she fulfill the imcompletions I have.
I am probably low gifted from mind.
I considered true all the talking from any elder.
And as such, I had assurance that my father knew the answer of every question of the world.
I was laughed upon for it.
But only what is possible seems true.
It is very troubling that lies need to be told.
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
That is why I try to lie as least as possible.
that I do not falsely please others in the name of Allah.
And that I say, "Insha Allah", (If God Wills) only when I am asking Allah to complete the work.
As for the intentions, only Allah knows best.
This is a despicable matter that arose due to distance between religions.
According to both our religions and Pakistani law, young children should stay with their mothers.
Their expenses are to be borne by the father, and the father can meet his children.
Then when they mature, they live with whom they want to live.
You are right that the actual problem is the relatives who misguide.
Feudalism has overshadowed our deeds.
Even here, thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in father's property so it is resisted, although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated.
Here these restriction regarding relations have created many evils in the society.
The concept of remarriage of a divorcee or a widow is getting rare.
Due to these unnecessary beliefs and tradition, the family system is facing disarray.
In our society, if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarry, then why it is not appreciated?
There is a Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago, now after getting all his children married when he married a widow, his own children have gone against him.
In my opinion, this is religious right, what do you say?
Until we are alive we will never accept that any one else can take the place of our mother. Is this kind of thought, a thought?
In my view, Sirs children have to think that, if after Marrying all the children, he himself married a widow. So is there any thing wrong in that?
In this way, this widow got some support and that uncle will also get someone to take care of the house.
Because, it is for sure that his children got busy in their own personal lives that they are not giving him time.
Reason for this is unknown.
If tomorrow their wifes refuses to serve that old man then what will he do?
This result is due of the Societial pressure.
When people will redicule on this situation and on their family then the children will feel ashamed on the second marriage of their father.
Actually they can defend the situation stating there father has done this according to the Islamic view.
This is one of the curses on our society like we are totally into Venery from the past 40-50 years.
It is acceptable for a wife to not let her husband marry another women, even if he commits crimes.
If it's in her power, she will not let him do so even after she dies.
Destroys her afterlife along with her husband's, while spreading immorality in the society.
Nothing happens with singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, preventing girls from being educated, and fear of love and marriage.
And about your question, when a man instead of bringing his wife home goes to someone else's wife, the dependents just make a fuss for the show then stay quiet and satisfied. (Later the relatives of the wife get angry.)
In the Indian subcontinent, we accepted Islam centuries ago but we still thought of culture and tradition as being more valuable than Islam.
In this way of thinking a man's 2nd marriage is considered ridiculous, divorce is seen as denigration, the divorced are untouchable, love in marriage is dishonorable, and a man marrying an older woman is devaluation of women.    Considering man's 2nd marriage as ridiculous, divorce as denigration, divorced as untouchable, love marriage as dishonor and considering a man marrying an older women is dissimulation of the women is only the result of this way of thinking.
By copying the western world we are declaring the religious and veiled to be old fashioned.
Accepting Islam was easy, but getting rid of the old ways of thinking is very hard.
Allah give us courage and daring.
Amen.
It was not really difficult to write Urdu ever before.

if some one die form Lay folk so killed.
May Allah bless and have mercy on you.
When I was coming back to the shop after Isha prayer tonight, one man who was sitting in a car, raised his hand and asked me to come.
I thought maybe this man has forgotten his way or maybe he wants to ask something. I stopped seeing his whole family was in his car.
He asked if I can understand Arabic very well or not. I said that there is no problem. You tell me what is the matter.
He started saying, I have come from Riyadh but here some one in Medina picked my pocket if you could please help me. I said forget about it. Because this has happened with me earlier also as I gave this man 20 riyals to pay for gas and go back to Riyadh but he started doing the same thing after moving forward a little.
I got really angry and when I told him and threatened him of a cop, he vanished from there.
So now this is the condition of us Muslims that even when we come to beg money, we come with families riding in cars and daily manage to get at least 2 to 3000.
Although there is an evident saying of the Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the hand above is better than the hand below and the hand above is the giving hand the lower is the taking hand.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims ( Amen)

The wife of the famous singer Adnan Sami went to a police station in Bombay accusing him of torturing her.
The police station suggested for her to contact a court.
Adnan Sami's wife, Saba Guladari, submitted a plea against her husband stating that Adnan Sami tortures her continuously.
and treats her inhumanely.
This has exceeded her tolerance limit, therefore a case should be recorded against Adnan Sami.
Police, instead of recording a report, suggested that she should contact the court by saying that this matter is not what is covered under police control.
In your opinion, is the accusation of Adnan Sami's wife on him correct?
What if this accusation is an attempt of tarnishing the name of Adnan Sami?
Let us know of your comments regarding this matter.
Adam Saanghar, stamp.
as long as blames exists so any man can do stuff to others.
there is nothing more important than respect.
what so ever relation of present wife and Adnan Samih , Adnan Samih leave his respected life and went India to earn money, now this popularity made hurdle for him.
this  is due to his own deed.
Washington.
high level American official said that president Obama made strong policy against Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
on this new policy of America about Afghanistan give more importance on War instead of Development.
Official said that Hamid Karzai consider as a hurdle in Afghanistan to get American Aid, because corruption in the government, intoxication business get increased and Taliban forces get regathered.
American official said that those people from American government who put pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more in which vice president Joe Biden and representative of Brack Obama for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke included.
He claimed this policy arose after the end of the administration of President Bush, who used to video conference with Hamid Karzai every two weeks. Bush used to stress the American role in rebuilding Afghanistan and its civilian institutions.
American officials say the Obama government would prefer to work with the state leaders rather than the central government.
Officials also say that will pressurize Karzai to step up the war on corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing new elections this year, and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his administration will support Karzai for the presidency.
Are the statements by American officials precursors to a change in the American policy towards Afghanistan?
Is Hamid Karzai's rule finally coming to an end?
What is your opinion on this?
In a series of three one-day matches between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2 to 1.
Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka in the first match, but Sri Lanka was victorious in the last two matches.
In the third match, the national cricket team's performance was very poor. In response to Sri Lanka's 309 runs, it only managed to hit 75 runs in 23 overs before going all out and suffering a humiliating defeat.
The result of the series shows the inconsistency of our cricket team's performance.
Despite the home ground advantage and claims, the National team was defeated. Can you give the reasons for this defeat?
Which area of the sport needs the most attention from the responsible authorities?
Are you satisfied with team selection?
Which department is most to blame for the defeat: fielding, batting or bowling?
Kindly share your opinion.
Malik Babar Hussain, It is sad that such customs of ignorance still exist in this modern age. These feudal target the poor and innocent people, who will believe that they are Muslims?
If any tribal chief proved his innocence by walking on fire, why didn't the government take action?
When will the judicial justice system play its role?
The Sri Lankan team has arrived in Pakistan to play a one-day series.
Besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
Upon reaching the Karachi airport, the Sri Lankan team was very warmly welcomed.
Two days between Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be played in Karachi whereas the third day will be played in Lahore.
Both teams have their claims over bowling, batting and fielding.
If the Sri Lankans are proud of their spinners, the Pakistanis trust their fast bowlers.
Sri Lankan Captain Mahela Jayvardena has said that not a single player from the Pakistan team is dangerous, but the whole team is dangerous.
Murli Dharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, whereas the Pakistan captain says that it will be a tough competition.
Shoaib Malik has said that we have played Murli Dharan and we'll see Mendis as well. We have prepared a secret game plan and we shall implement that on the ground.
Will the Pak-Sri Lanka series be really as interesting and exciting as the claims are?
Who will dominate the series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka?
Who will win the series?
who will be main of the series?
Please let us know what your recommendation is.

These are all the same people who have responsible Kashmirs fighting for their freedom for the last sixty years.
No one asked about that now that they have chosen fundamentalism and are fighting for terrorism. So now they have started talking about a deal.
First they brutally killed Muslims. Now they are trying to resolve issues.
Pakistan has to understand their two-way policy.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating this situation, hoping to distract world attention from the Kashmir issue.
But Pakistan has always showed the true face of India to the world.
Now the British government has realized that the Indian government is maligning Pakistan for terrorism so that it can occupy Kashmir.
They are unwilling to talk with Pakistan on this matter.
British foreign minister David Miliband said that resolving the Kashmir issue will end extremism. The Pakistan government will be able to handle the border issues.
It should be noted that American president Obama has already expressed similar views on the Kashmir issue.
The British foreign minister talked to media in Mumbai and has written an essay asserting that the idea of war on terror is wrong, namely, Bush's policy of killing others on the basis of the threat to oneself.
David Miliband has said that Pakistan should show leniency towards extremist groups.
Under pressure from major world powers to resolve the Kashmir issue, India is creating unrest in the region to distract world from this issue.
The Terrorist attack in Mumbai is also a part of this strategy.
Does India want the allegations of terrorism to be its scapegoat to avoid peace talks?
Tell us your opinion.
Usman Aftab
In my opinion, a lot of the powerful nations do not want to bring harm to Pakistan.
But they are thinking of plans to keep it on their leash as they know that Pakistan is a nuclear power.
They want to fuel a situation for a revolution.
Other nations are thinking that in cornering Pakistan they may face geographical political problems. They also want to aid Pakistan, but along with that they also want to accomplish their ulterior motives.

Indians have been known to be snakes in the grass.

With the help of American wealth Rasil Quium gave a speech  with which he blew out American's mind this is wrong,but now   the surprising thing is attack and watch truth will be proved.Who's right.
Israel attacked Lamas but there was no one to stop them,the Indian brother just watched work done by Israel wanted to do some thing.
Prime minster Syed Yousuf said that all the issues of America's will be taken to the parliament and will be solved with each sentence kept in mind.

American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference, advised newly elected President, Barack Obama. Former president G.W. Bush said that he had made many mistakes in his presidency and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
'I did, as a president, whatever I felt was appropriate, according to the situation, and the American law and constitution, giving preference to American interest over my own acceptance'.
President Bush said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him, and considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.

This is a very hurtful situation that Israel is publicly massacring the Palestinians.  The same situation is here in Kashmir but the Security Council isn't bothered by it. bother by it.
The many organizations who are in Palestine and Kashmir should continue their fight for freedom creating unity between themselves.  And keep fighting every kind of aggression, one of these days their martyr will bring a result. By the will of Allah.
Israeli air attacks continue in Gaza.  Since then several Palestinian Men, Women and children have been martyred.
Important political leaders of Hamas Nazarian have been martyred along with their wives and kids.
The meeting of Security Council ended without any decision.
The resolution presented by Libia and other Arab countries condemning Israel is facing American opposition in the meeting.
The civilian population of Philistine has been under attack by the Israeli Air force for the past couple of days.
The world showed strong reaction over Mumbai attacks but no one, including Great Britain and US is showing any reaction over the violence of Israel.
Why are the leading Muslim countries silent?

Saeed, New York.
I think the problem lies in the illiteracy of our nation. People do not know how their money is spent. The Government is solving its problems by introducing new taxes and the Power and Gas crisis remains unsolved.
Everybody knows the real faces of the elected representatives of the people.
The power crisis has become worse in Pakistan.
On the other hand, the price of gas has been increased by 18%. While due to unavailability of petrol, people are facing several difficulties in keeping up with these rising prices.
The business and industrial communities of Pakistan are violently protesting against the power and gas crisis.
The producers have given the ultimatum of closing the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is perturbed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
The production life cycle has become paralyzed.
The government institutions are blaming each other for expressing their respective stances.
Are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas not a joke against the nation?
Why is attention not being paid to solving the problems?
Are the wheels of national development not seeming jammed by the government?
What immediate steps can you suggest to take control over this crisis?
Let us know of your opinions.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers have a greater responsibility.
I am surprised that they are giving difficulty to the public who called for a democratic government.    I am surprised that they are contending with the public who called for a democratic government.
The unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a torture.    The scarcity of electricity, gas, and petrol has become a struggle.
There is no control over government institutions.    This sounds good.
The law and order situation is getting worse, day to day. May Allah have mercy on this country.    Day to day, law and order is slipping.  May Allah have mercy on this country.
The New Year started.    The new year has begun.
The previous year was a year of protests and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered for terrorism.    The previous year, with its protests and political upheavals, will also be remembered for the terrorism which occurred.
The removal of President Musharraf from power, and President Bush's eight year regime coming to an end, Bush getting shoes thrown at and the establishment of a democratic government in Pakistan, sudden calamities, the earthquake of Balochistan, the global financial crisis and depression.    This is just a list of things that have happened.  What is supposed to tie them together?
Now a new year has arrived, how do you see the new year?    Now that a new year has arrived, what do you expect to see happening?

The India cricket team is scheduled to play three tests, five one day and one twenty twenty match on its Pakistan tour.
Vice president of Indian cricket board Mr. Ragiv Shukla told Geo News that he has sought permission for the tour of Pakistan from the Indian government but due to current tensions between the two counties the tour has been canceled.

Salman from Karachi
Those people who feel proud of visiting India
and direct or produce their videos in India should open their eyes that what response India is giving.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami in which he said that he is not a Pakistani national but is British.
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan at the first opportunity, because he did not get honor there either.

After the Mumbai attacks, the mode of the Indians have changed.
Jagjit Singh reacted by expressing that he hates Pakistan and Pakistanis.
It should be known that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsle and how he has become helpless now? Adnan Sami should stay in India. There is no need for him to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Aalam,
Karachi. I will only say so much about Jagjit Singh, that he too changes colors like a chameleon,
and speaks on the occasion. Pakistanis, open your eyes and see how much you are respected in India. Do not be dull minded.
After the Mumbai incident, their hate filled speech has increased. Now they are spreading poison about famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said ""You dog this is a farewell kiss""
After that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards Bush. president Bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself.
The second shoe hit the American Flag.
Security personnels dragged the journalist away from there.
at this point, president Bush said that he didn't know why he had done so , Shoe was of number 10, I had no problem.
Do you think this reaction of the journalist wasn't an expression of deprecation or President bush from the Iraqi people?
What would you say on this incident?
The tension between Pakistan and India's relations after the terrorism in Mumbai got further intense when the fighter planes from the Indian Air force violated the Pakistani airspace in Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
As a result of retaliation from Pak Air force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
Sources say that both Indian planes were loaded with ammunition.
It is the first incident of this kind in the present strained situation.
The Pakistan Air Force has affirmed that it is absolutely ready to defend the country .
Federal Minister of Information, Sherry Rehman, has stated that the Indian leaders have acknowledged that the violation of Pakistani airspace occurred by mistake.
Pakistan's military sources have declared that this is a grave incident.
Do you think India really intends to launch an air raid attack on Pakistan?
Is India's claim true, that the violation of Pakistani airspace was a mistake, or is India trying to cover up an attempt to analyze the capability of the Pakistan Air Force?
Will this incident cause an increase in tension between the two countries?

It is true, and we remember how many innocent people were murdered.  Nasirullah Babur did a good deed today.
But she changed afterwards.
It is also true that she ignored some candidates for the party and decided to chose her own son to serve as the representative of the People party.  How is that democratic?
