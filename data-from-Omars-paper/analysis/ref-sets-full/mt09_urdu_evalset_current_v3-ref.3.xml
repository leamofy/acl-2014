    <seg id="2">This research by American scientists has come out as a result of experiments conducted on mice.</seg>
    <seg id="3">Experiments proved that the ability to fight the flu virus, relatively decreased in mice kept on a low calorie diet.</seg>

     <seg id="1">'First Nuclear Test, Carried Out in 1990'</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reed, who has worked as Weapons Designer at America's Lever National Laboratory, wrote this book in coordination with former Director of Technical Intelligence at the Alamos National Laboratory.</seg>
    <seg id="3">This book has been written under the title, 'The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation' and both the writers have claimed in it that every country that has made the atom bomb has either stolen nuclear secrets from another country or has had the cooperation of another atomic power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Thomas Reed said in an interview to the US News that in 1990 China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb during Benazir Bhutto regime.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reed said that he believes, based on many reasons, that China had tested Pakistan's first atomic bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">The reasons include the design of that bomb and information received during conversations with Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He further said that this is why Pakistan was able to carry out atomic test within only two weeks and three days in response to India's atomic tests in 1998.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reed recalled that Russia had suddenly conducted an atomic test in 1961 and in response to it, it took America seventeen days to conduct a test in spite of the fact that America had that bomb for a long time.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that the atom bomb tested by Pakistan in May, 1998, had been made very carefully and Pakistani scientists had full confidence in it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When asked, why China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, Thomas Reed replied, it was because India was the common enemy of China and Pakistan.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that there was also evidence that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan had in fact used Chinese design, and in addition, the documents that were later acquired from Libya confirm this.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Responding to another question as to whether joint atomic tests are common practice, he said that America had openly conducted nuclear test in the Nevada Desert for Britain in 1990.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that we also speculate that Israel was also provided access to the results of this test.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reed was also asked whether China's atomic proliferation program continues.</seg>
    <seg id="15">At this, Thomas Reed said that since 1991China had been providing raw materials, instructions and design for the nuclear installation in the Iranian city, Isfahan.</seg>
    <seg id="16">In addition to this, China also provided Iran with the enrichment plant in Karaj</seg>
    <seg id="17">He said that China had been providing atomic technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen through North Korea.</seg>

    <seg id="5">An example of this is in front of us as an employee of Lahore based private TV channel 5 committed suicide because he did not get his salary for four months. Even today, many employees are living in hardship because of forced expulsions and non payment of salaries for months.</seg>
    <seg id="6">He said that right steps should be taken against owners of TV channels and newspapers and a permanent protest camp should be put in front of the parliament for the rights of journalists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">C. R. Shamsi criticized Punjab Governor, Salman Taseer, saying that employees are being dismissed from his Urdu newspaper 'Aajkal' without any notice.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Whereas the Daily Jinnah, Daily Khabrain, Channel 5, Business Plus TV and AaJ TV too have dismissed dozens of employees.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Addressing the protesters, Secretary General of PUFJ, Mazhar Abbas, said that journalist organizations all across the country are observing today as a black day against the dismissal of journalists and newspaper employees, while the journalists will go to the parliament session wearing black bands around their arms in order to claim their rights.</seg>
    <seg id="10">According to Mazhar Abbas, employees and journalists are being exploited in 85% of the newspapers and TV channels where they are working without ant contracts.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that so far, more than 200 journalists and employees are being dismissed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is feared that the owners will dismiss hundreds of more employees during the current year under the pretext of economic crisis.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Mazhar Abbas said that the movement of journalists will continue until the dismissed employees are reinstated, the Seventh Wage Board Award specifying the wages of newspaper employees is implemented and salaries unpaid for several months of TV channels and newspaper workers are disbursed.</seg>

    <seg id="5">As far as the official statement is concerned everything seems fine.</seg>
    <seg id="6">But in reality, the European Union presents a sad picture of internal conflicts.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Role of the Czech Republic as President of the Union is already weak.</seg>
    <seg id="8">On top of it, the internal conflicts have rendered it helpless.</seg>
    <seg id="9">On the other hand, the French President is behaving as if he is still discharging his duties as the President of the European Union.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Although France has already completed its six month term.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he does have the ability to do that but he does not have permission to do so.</seg>
    <seg id="12">French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner finds himself in the most absurd situation</seg>
    <seg id="13">He is part of the delegation that is being led by the Foreign Minister of Czech Republic, Schwarzenberg.</seg>
    <seg id="14">On top of that, both Foreign Ministers are giving divergent statement regarding the Middle East war.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Kouchner believes that Israel has the right to defend itself whereas according to Schwarzenberg this war does not fall under the category of self defense. On the other hand Germany has also dispatched its special envoy to the Middle East. Until the European Union shows cohesiveness in its stand it can never be successful at the diplomatic front.</seg>
    <seg id="16">The proof for this is Israeli attitude that does not give any credence to the peace initiatives of Europe</seg>

    <seg id="4">And when he had to negotiate for several weeks with nearly 30 banks that gave loans to his business group, he came into limelight and he could also see the future of Merckle Group as bleak.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Merckle Group faced loss of several hundred million euros after buying shares of the German car manufacturer Volks Wagen, due to the economic crisis.</seg>
    <seg id="6">After that, when financial institutions declined to lend to this Group the required loan of 700 million to 1 billion euros, Merckle came under immense pressure.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Some time ago, the same banks had agreed to give loan on emergency basis to the Merckle Group, but Adolf Merckle who started as a small industrialist and rose to this position and the annual income of whose industrial group was around 30 billion euros could not bear the loss of his investment powers.</seg>
    <seg id="8">When Adolf Merckle took over the family business after the death of his father, he organized it on modern principles and soon made enormous progress.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He named his company Ratiopharm, which today is a highly successful and a very large drug manufacturing company in Germany.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Until some time ago, the business worth of this pharmaceutical company was between 5 and 6 billion euros and it still makes an annual income of 8.1billion euros. After the tremendous success of Ratiopharm, Merckle Group acquired many large companies; ranging from the building and construction material company, Heidelberg Cement, to the special vehicles manufacturing company, Kaessbohrer.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The worldwide workforce of Merckle Group is almost 100,000 persons, and Ratiopharm pharmaceutical company has always enjoyed special significance.</seg>
    <seg id="12">During his life Adolf Merckle said on several occasions, "We have been making medicine for the last four generations.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Now the control of this company is in the hands of my children and I hope that for the next few hundred years it will remain under the administration of my family.</seg>

    <seg id="9">Apart from Bavaria, Hamburg is also thinking on these lines.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Senator of Interior Affairs, Christoph Ahlhaus, from CDU said, "When research is carried out on scientific lines, one cannot make conclusions of one's choice but they depend on the statistics gathered as a result of research.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Ahlhaus drew attention to an analytical report of the provincial office on the prevention of crimes which had been prepared in July, 2006 and which ascertained the rate of crimes among foreigners in Bergdorf area of Hamburg.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Results suggested that the crime rate among the foreigners here</seg>

    <seg id="3">Exercise is good for health at any age.</seg>
    <seg id="4">It rejuvenates your heart, reduces cholesterol levels, helps lower weight, helps prevent diabetes and slows down the onset of Alzheimer.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Unfortunately, in many people the ability to exercise decreases with advancing age.</seg>

    <seg id="7">American medical experts say that lack exercise can lead to several health problems.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Patricia Polacco of the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota, says that age is a major factor in a person's reduce ability to exercise and reduction in physical acitivity.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She headed a study on the ability to exercise and heart diseases in old age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the heart's activity.</seg>
    <seg id="12">In which the heart's action of pumping blood, its contraction and the heart's resting phase was observed.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Experts focused their attention on the left side of the heart which is the central point for pumping blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They found that with the advancing age there is an increased disturbance in the heart's process of relaxation.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says that with increase in age the heart's relaxation process slows down and it also affects ones ability to exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Gavan Ken was part of this study</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that he was surprised to note that this thing necessarily affects it and it also clarifies as to what extent poor exercise regimen is related to the heart's relaxation process.</seg>
    <seg id="18">At times blood pressure can also be responsible for disturbances in heart's processes and heart diseases.</seg>

     <seg id="2">and when in my childhood I used to watch my paternal and maternal uncles doing menial labor, I used to pray to God to spare me from such physical hardship.</seg>
     <seg id="3">To avoid this, I wrote a letter to the editor of Daily Imroz and asked him what I should do after matriculation so that I did not have to do hard labor.</seg>
     <seg id="4">The editor replied that I should become doctor or engineer and start studying the respective subjects.</seg>
     <seg id="5">From the beginning, I was inclined towards engineering and in the matriculation I had studied Technical Drawing instead of Biology.</seg>
     <seg id="6">But at the time of admission in F.Sc., my elder brother forced me to do F.Sc. in pre-medical and become a doctor.</seg>
     <seg id="7">I studied Biology hardly for one month and when I could not understand a word of it, I exchanged it for Mathematics.</seg>
     <seg id="8">I mean the fear of menial labor made an engineer of me and now I am at a very good position among many of my peers and am always thankful to God for this blessing.</seg>
     <seg id="9">I was reminded of this when I was trying to lift the carpets from my old home with the help of my two young sons.</seg>
     <seg id="10">We were not even half an hour into the work when the younger son said, "Dad, I think I was not born to do this work".</seg>
     <seg id="11">I said if this were true then he should study diligently like me and get rid of the menial labor.</seg>
     <seg id="12">The son said that he was studying and would complete his studies but he could not do that kind of work.</seg>
     <seg id="13">Somehow, the three of us completed that work in three hours and returned home.</seg>

     <seg id="1">The conditions are steadily getting worse in the troubled areas of Swat in the Frontier province despite the military operation that has been going on for more than a year.</seg>
     <seg id="2">On the one hand, the government's writ in this area has been reduced to passage of a resolution of condemnation in the National Assembly and on the other hand the influence of the illegal FM radio channel of the Taliban has been steadily increasing in Swat.</seg>
     <seg id="3">The third aspect is that the ordinary citizen finds it convenient to obey the person who is ruling the area.</seg>
     <seg id="4">The claims are made about the deaths of many extremists in Swat by the gunship helicopters and in the artillery fire in the operation being conducted by the security forces. But despite these deaths, not only have the Taliban consolidated even further but according to one estimate, their control has spread to almost eighty percent of Swat.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Consequently, on the one hand the government is not prepared to concede its failure and on the other hand, the Taliban are more stable.</seg>
     <seg id="6">And who has been crushed between the two: the ordinary citizens.</seg>
     <seg id="7">It is said in Swat now that someone asked what kind of people Taliban were and the reply came that they were very good since they were the guardians of the faith and were fighting the 'enemies of God and religion'.</seg>

 <doc docid="urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post19" genre="wb">

     <seg id="2">Then it was asked who were the enemies of the religion and the country and the answer came; we, the ordinary citizens.</seg>
     <seg id="3">The heavenly Swat is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.</seg>
     <seg id="4">According to the government strategy so far, the talks are being conducted along with the use of force.</seg>
     <seg id="5">But the use of force has been of no use except further enhancing the Taliban's power and creating sympathy for them among the public.</seg>

     <seg id="3">But along with the implementation of Shariat, the government will have to focus on the economic problems too</seg>
     <seg id="4">The initial steps taken by General Musharraf suggested that this nation might get rid of the unworthy politicians but the lust for power transformed all his intentions</seg>
     <seg id="5">whatever the hopes were, after joining the 'war of terror', he actually began to consider himself immortal</seg>
     <seg id="6">and expectations of taking certain steps ended.</seg>
     <seg id="7">As the Bush era neared its end, he began to worry about the end of his regime and signed a deal with the thieves in panic.</seg>
     <seg id="8">General Musharraf could nevertheless have controlled the military but the present government does not even know what is happening.</seg>
     <seg id="9">Whether it be Bajaur or Swat, the army does not control the terrorism. And it bombs the 'enemy' i.e. 'the people'. It harms the life and finances of the 'enemy', as well as make them psychotic. That means we are the enemies</seg>

     <seg id="5">The curfew is imposed so that the Taliban may easily move around.</seg>
     <seg id="6">Tonight, during the curfew they came in 8 trucks and dug up trenches in the suburbs of Mingora.</seg>
     <seg id="7">The question is how they reached there in spite of the curfew.</seg>

     <seg id="2">They had been expressing this displeasure everyday by blowing up schools and colleges for women at one place or the other.</seg>
     <seg id="3">But like most other thoughts, this thought also proved untrue. According to this news item on CNN, a Taliban's group has demolished a school for boys with the help of explosives on this sacred Monday.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Swat, Taliban Demolish a Boys' School</seg>
     <seg id="5">Actually, the girls' schools were first destroyed following the famous English proverb "ladies first". It is beyond reason why people are still bent upon calling Taliban as uncivilized and wild people ignorant of civilization.</seg>
