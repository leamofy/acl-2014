<seg id="1">Avoid Dieting to Avoid Flu</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">This research of American scientists has come to light after experiments done on mice.</seg>
<seg id="3">The experiments have proved that the capability of fighting Flu virus became less in mice placed on food containing fewer calories.</seg>
<seg id="4">The old saying that,'It's better to starve during fever,'has been proven wrong by the research.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the scientists,eat well during fever.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the researchers of Michigan State University, the fighting capability against infections in mice that were placed on a diet was found meagre and the chances of their death increased, while the mice placed on regular food had a very high immunity against flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Professor Elizabeth Gardner, people on a diet will not only be affected very quickly by the flu,it will also take more time for them to recuperate.</seg>
<seg id="8">She also says that even those people who have taken the flu vaccine should avoid dieting during the few months of winter.</seg>

<seg id="1">"First Nuclear Experiment conducted in 1990"</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Thomas Reed, who has worked as a weapon designer in Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory of America, has written this book in collaboration with Danny Stillman,the former Director of Technical Intelligence of Los Alamos National Laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="3">This book has been written with the title 'Nuclear Express:A Political History of the Bomb And its Proliferation,' and in this both the authors have claimed that any country that has made an atomic bomb has either stolen the nuclear secrets of another country or has had cooperation with some other nuclear power.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thomas Reed said in an interview to US News that in 1990, in the era of Benazir Bhutto, China had conducted the experiment of Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas Reed said that he is convinced on the basis of several reasons that China has conducted the experiment of Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">Those reasons include the design of the bomb and information obtained while talking to the scientists of China.</seg>
<seg id="7">He further said that this was the reason why in 1998, Pakistan was able to conduct a nuclear experiment just in two weeks and three days in response to India's nuclear experiment.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thomas Reed also reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and it took 17 days for America to do the experiment in response to this, although America already had this bomb for awhile.</seg>
<seg id="9">He further said that the atom bomb, whose experiment was done in 1998 by Pakistan, was developed with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had full confidence in it.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Thomas Reed was asked if China had provided the nuclear technology to Pakistan, he replied that India was a common enemy of China and Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="11">He said that the proof to this also exists in that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and, apart from this, the documents retrieved from Libya afterwards also proved this.</seg>
<seg id="12">To another question as to whether it is usual to carry out nuclear experiments with others, he said that in 1990 America openly conducted a nuclear experiment for Britain in the desert of Nevada.</seg>
<seg id="13">He said that we may also presume that Israel, too, was given access to the results of this experiment.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thomas Reed was also asked whether China's nuclear proliferation program is active.</seg>
<seg id="15">On this, Thomas Reid said that since 1991, China has been providing raw material, instructions, and designs for the nuclear structure situated in Ispahan, a city in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="16">Besides this, China has also provided an enrichment plant to Iran in Karaj.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen through North Korea.</seg>

<seg id="2">On Tuesday in front of Islamabad Press Club, journalists and newspaper workers rallied and raised slogans in a protest organized by the organization of the journalists of Islamabad 'RIUJ' against media owners and the government on the sacking of a large number of employees from TV channels and newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="3">Addressing the demonstrators, the senior member of the largest organization of the journalists, Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, C. R. Shamsi, said that those politicians who were protesting with us on the streets lately, have now become rulers and are sitting in the parliament; however, they are not doing any good for the rights of journalists, as they are afraid of a specific group of newspaper owners.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said that the newspaper owners, who talk about human rights, have turned their organizations into torture cells and labor camps, where, despite making billions of rupees, they are committing financial murder on workers by paying them extremely low wages and sacking them from the employment.</seg>
<seg id="5">In front of us, the example of this is that of a worker of a private TV channel FIVE who committed suicide after not getting the salary for four months, and even today, many workers are living miserably because of forced dismissals and not getting salaries for months.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said that direct action should be taken against TV and newspaper owners, and for the rights of journalists, a protest camp is needed on a permanent basis in front of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="7">Criticizing the Governor of the Punjab Salman Taseer, C. R. Shamsi said that the employees are being sacked without any notice from his Urdu newspaper 'Aaj Kal',</seg>

<seg id="1">European Union's Role in Middle East Peace</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">If seen from the official perspective, the European Union's role in reconciliation efforts to stop the Middle East war is decisive.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the Brussels government stand, efforts of the Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy's are synonymous to help in this task.</seg>
<seg id="4">The spokesman of the European Commission Amadeu Altafaj said that all such efforts through which sending a joint message to the warring parties from the European Union could be helpful, are worthy of praise.</seg>
<seg id="5">Everything looks fine from the perspective of the official statement.</seg>
<seg id="6">But, in reality, the European Union is presenting a regretful picture of the internal tug of war.</seg>
<seg id="7">The role of the Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak.</seg>
<seg id="8">On top of this, the internal wrangling has made it helpless.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the other hand, the French President Sarkozy is acting like he is still discharging the duties as the president of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although France has already completed its six-month presidential tenure.</seg>
<seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play the lead role and he can do it; but he is not permitted for this.</seg>
<seg id="12">The most embarrassing situation is being faced by French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner.</seg>
<seg id="13">He is in the delegation which is headed by the Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic, Schwarzenberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">And on top of this, both foreign ministers are giving different statements about the Middle East war.</seg>
<seg id="15">Kouchner says that Israel has a right of self-defense, while according to Schwarzenberg, this war does not come under self defense. In the meantime, Germany has also sent its special envoy to the Middle East. Until the European Union shows harmony based on similar point of views, it cannot succeed on the diplomatic front.</seg>
<seg id="16">The proof of this is the attitude of Israel, which does not give any importance to the reconciliation efforts of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="17">This is the golden opportunity for the European Union to accomplish something, as America has already failed in the Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.</seg>

</hl>
<seg id="2">Although Adolf Merckle, a resident of the area of Swabia of South Germany, has left a huge business group after him.</seg>
<seg id="3">But the common German citizens did not know much about him up until a little while ago.</seg>
<seg id="4">Then, when he had to negotiate with about 30 banks for many weeks which provided loans to his business group, he became the subject of the headlines, and the future of Merckle Group also looked to bleak him.</seg>
<seg id="5">Merckle Group also had to bear a loss of hundreds of millions of Euros due to the financial crisis after buying shares of German car manufacturing company Volkswagen.</seg>
<seg id="6">And when the financial institutions denied the new loans, valued at between 700 million and one-billion Euros, mandatorily needed by this group, Merckle came under severe stress.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sometime back, these very banks had agreed to provide loans to Merckle Group on an emergency basis; however, Adolf Merckle, who had risen to such heights from a small industrialist that his group's income had become around 30 billion Euros, could not bear the loss of his investment power.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Adolf Merckle took charge of his family business after the death of his father, he managed it on the modern lines and gave it a tremendous boost.</seg>
<seg id="9">He named his company Ratiopharm, which is an extremely successful and very large pharmaceutical firm of Germany today.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until sometime ago, the business worth of this pharmaceutical firm was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and even now it earns 1.8 billion Euros annually. After the huge success of Ratiopharm, Merckle Group purchased many large firms, which included a company named Heidelberg Cement manufacturing construction materials to the company named Kaessbohrer, which manufactures a special type of vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="11">The number of the employees of Merckle Group around the globe is one-hundred thousand and in its assets, Ratiopharm, the drug manufacturing company, has always held special importance.</seg>
<seg id="12">Adolf Merckle had said this many times in his life: "We have been manufacturing drugs for four generations.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now the management of this firm is in the hands of my children and I hope that this firm will still remain under my family's management for a few hundred years.</seg>
<seg id="14">After the suicide of Adolf Merckle, banks have approved interim loans worth 400 million Euros for his group VEM, but on the condition that VEM has to sell Ratiopharm so that the financial condition of this group could be improved on a long-term basis.</seg>
<seg id="15">This way, after the death of Adolf Merckle, the Merckle Group would not remain the same like it used to be.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to the latest statistics, the crime rate among foreigners between 2004 and 2007</seg>
<seg id="3">has reduced from 22.9 percent</seg>
<seg id="4">to 21.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to Joachim Herrmann, the Interior Minister of Bavaria Province, this is apparently a mere positive change.</seg>
<seg id="6">He said: "It should be kept in mind that the number of foreigners seeking German nationality is increasing."</seg>
<seg id="7">Therefore, this fact should also be mentioned in the statistics that although the person who commits a crime is a German, he/she also has a foreign background.</seg>
<seg id="8">Herrmann said that from 2010, his province will keep this fact in mind while collecting statistics about criminals.</seg>
<seg id="9">Besides Bavaria, the province of Hamburg is also thinking on the same lines.</seg>
<seg id="10">Senator for Interior Affairs Christoph Ahlhaus of CDU said: "When investigations are done according to the scientific method, a person cannot compile results beforehand as per his/her own will, instead the results depend on the statistics which come after the investigations have been completed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Ahlhaus drew attention to an analytical report of a provincial crime control office, which was prepared in 2006, and according to which it was investigated that in Bergdorf, a part of the city of Hamburg, what percentage of the foreigners is involved in the crimes taking place there.</seg>
<seg id="12">The results have shown that here foreigners'</seg>
<seg id="13">rate of crime is lower as compared to the crimes taking place in the whole province.</seg>
<seg id="14">Contrary to this, when in Berlin, in 2006 the rate of crime in youngsters was reviewed, it was found that the percentage of youngsters having foreign background was 44</seg>
<seg id="15">.7 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, the other political parties of Germany, for example Linkspartei, the party of environmentalists, Greens and the leftist party, SPD, are against this proposal that, while collecting statistics related to crimes, this information should also be collected in which German citizens have a foreign background.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new American President Barack Hussein Obama has started acting superficially on the promises made during his election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this connection he has issued instructions for making a plan for the return of American troops from Iraq; whereas, today, the American President will sign the order to close the ignominious prison of Guantanamo Bay.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is expected that today President Barack Obama is possibly going to sign the order according to which Guantanamo Bay prison will be closed within a year.</seg>
<seg id="6">Besides this, orders for the review of the investigative methods on suspected terrorists and the ban on the use of foul language with the prisoners are also expected to be issued from the White House.</seg>
<seg id="7">President Barack Obama started working on fulfilling the election promises on the first day of his presidency and has taken steps for making the actions and working of his government transparent as the priority.</seg>
<seg id="8">The observers say that the American President has started making efforts to save the falling reputation of America on the international level, but it is very difficult for him to succeed in it, because as long as America is supporting the predator government of Israel, nothing good can be expected from her. If America wants to save its reputation, then it has to withdraw from supporting Israel and should not participate in her crimes.</seg>

<seg id="2">The news agency Mehr has copied with reference of the British newspaper, The Times, that the former Prime Minister of Britain has emphasized the need to include Hamas in the Middle East peace process.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to the newspaper, Tony Blair said that a way should be found through which Hamas should be brought into the peace process of the Middle East. Blair also strongly criticized the Bush administration for talking only to Mahmoud Abbas and ignoring Hamas. It should remain clear that the Western countries, after assessing the public and administrative power of Hamas, are now talking about including it in the conference, whereas before this they used to call Hamas a terrorist organization; a terrorist organization which is defending its country and trying to emancipate its country from the grip of others, whose houses and country have been occupied for sixty years by a tyrannical government like that of Israel.</seg>

</hl>

<seg id="3">if taken daily, reduces the risk of breast cancer by more than one third in women aged less than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this research, done in the Moffitt Cancer Center in the state of Florida in America, it has been said that the risk of cancer of the breast tumor in the women, aged under 50,</seg>
<seg id="5">is reduced by up to 37 percent for those who drink at least three cups of tea daily.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the research, it was also said that the women of higher age don't get any noticeable benefits in this regard by taking three or more cups of tea daily.</seg>
<seg id="7">The experts say that the reason of this is the presence of some elements in the tea that are effective against those tumors which occur in the women of less than 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="8">This research was done on more than five-thousand women who were treated for breast cancer in the Moffitt Cancer Center, situated in the city of Tampa in the state of Florida.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.</seg>
<seg id="10">The experts compared their medical records and their lifestyle with those of the women who were safe from breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="11">The experts also came to know that tea visibly showed its effect on a special type of cancer 'lobular' which was reduced up to 66 percent.</seg>
<seg id="12">Every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type.</seg>
<seg id="13">This type of cancer is dangerous because of the reason that it is deep-seated and usually it is diagnosed when it has already widely spread.</seg>
<seg id="14">The experts say that drinking at least three cups of tea daily on a regular basis may reduce the risk of breast cancer conspicuously in younger women.</seg>

</hl>
<seg id="2">The chief of the Indian Army General Deepak Kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan; however, to defend the country, and to assure the safety of its interests, we are ready at all times for giving sacrifices.</seg>
<seg id="3">General Kapoor blamed that despite reassurances and pressure from the international community on Pakistan as a result of the Mumbai attacks, in his words, the infrastructure of terrorism is not only intact on Pakistani soil, but is also active.</seg>
<seg id="4">He said this while talking to news correspondents in Srinagar.</seg>
<seg id="5">The chief of the Indian army was on a one-day visit to the valley of Kashmir to review the collective security situation and the preparations of the army on the borders in Kashmir under the New Delhi administration.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was asked what his comments were in reference to the media reports that Pakistan has rejected the proof presented by India with reference to the Mumbai attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">General Kapoor said that the decisions on the matter pertaining to war and peace are taken by the political leadership.</seg>
<seg id="8">Talking about the alleged infrastructure of terrorism present on Pakistani soil, he said that the Indian army will face those elements who are determined to disrupt peace and to weaken India.</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that seven-hundred to eight-hundred militants are present in the Indian Kashmir, out of which about fifty percent are foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="10">General Deepak Kapoor said that with better weather conditions, the effort of influx from Pakistan and Kashmir under Pakistan's administration may increase; however, India has enhanced alert on the borders.</seg>
<seg id="11">He rejected the possibility of reduction in the strength of the army deployed in the Indian-administered Kashmir by saying that the security of the country could not be compromised.</seg>

<seg id="2">Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q have submitted their draft Eighteenth Amendment bills to the National Assembly and the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="3">So far, it seems that drafts for the Eighteenth Amendment are political tricks, and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is because of the same reason that no one has so far made any hue and cry in favor of this amendment on the floor of the Assembly or the Senate and forced the houses to approve this amendment.</seg>
<seg id="5">It appears that after submitting the draft Eighteenth Amendment, these parties have created a proof of their effort, which means they are now able to tell the people tomorrow that they had submitted the amendment, but the speaker of the government party did not process it.</seg>
<seg id="6">MQM is a coalition partner of the government, Muslim league N is a hidden ally of the government, whereas Muslim League Q is a party responsible for passing the Seventeenth Amendment.

<seg id="5">From the beginning I was interested in engineering, that is why I studied technical drawing instead of biology.</seg>

<seg id="2">On one hand, writ of the government in this area is now limited only to passing a condemnation resolution in the National Assembly, whereas on the other hand, the influence of the Taliban's illegal FM radio channel is significantly increasing in Sawat.</seg>
<seg id="3">Thirdly, a common man deems it safe to be showing submissiveness to those who are practically in control of this area.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Sawat, killing of extremists is claimed as a result of shelling from gunship helicopters and artillery fires during security forces operations, but even with these killings, the Taliban have not only gathered more strength, but, according to an estimate, they are in control of 80% of the Sawat area.</seg>
<seg id="5">The result is that on one hand, the government is not ready to accept its failures, and on the other hand, the Taliban are strong.</seg>
<seg id="6">Who is being crushed in between - the poor citizens!</seg>
<seg id="7">In Sawat someone asked how are the Taliban? The reply came that they are very good, because they are the custodians of Allah's code of life and are fighting against 'enemies of Allah and the religion of Allah'.</seg>
<seg id="8">Another question was asked, how is army? The answer received said very well, because it is 'defending the country and fighting against the enemies of the country'.</seg>
<seg id="9">Then it was asked who is the enemy of Allah's Code of life and the country? The reply was "we the public".</seg>

<seg id="1">I am surprised how the Pakistan army will fight with the Indian army when it cannot control a small group of Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="2">They could not track an illegally-run FM Channel of Taliban, which I think is very simple.</seg>
<seg id="3">But still, it is spreading poisonous propaganda with full might.</seg>
<seg id="4">After girls schools, boys schools are now being destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Curfew is imposed so as to facilitate the movement of Taliban.</seg>
<seg id="6">Last night during curfew hours, they penetrated the suburbs of Mangora and made hideouts.</seg>
<seg id="7">The question arises as to how they reached there during curfew hours.</seg>
<seg id="8">The army can kill Akbar Bugti in his house and salutes Talibans.</seg>
<seg id="9">For God's sake, someone make this army understand to help free the defenseless people of Sawat out of the grips of the Taliban and prove that the Pakistan army can overpower any kind of enemy.</seg>

<seg id="1">The respectable gentleman says that in the world, most of the bloodshed was caused by religion. You tell me if there had been no religion at all, had this bloodshed not happened.</seg>
<seg id="2">Are Punjabi, Pathan, white, black, Mehsud and other tribes the products of religion?</seg>
<seg id="3">No, not at all. Sir, only religion teaches us that there is no white, no black, no Punjabi, and no refugee. If there had been no religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in the war between white and black, and the rest would have fallen prey to enmity on the basis of cost and race.</seg>
<seg id="4">In fact, religion provides moral training to human beings and makes them disciplined on the grounds that they have not been born with their own free will, but the Creator of the universe has sent them here and they have to live in this world in accordance with God's commands.</seg>
<seg id="5">As a Muslim, I have a firm belief that Islam is a complete code of life and a true religion.</seg>

<seg id="1">There occurred a surprising event yesterday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="2">The whole police are running here and there and not taking action on illegal parking.</seg>
<seg id="3">Moreover, nypd traffic was not in the mood to check illegal parking, either.</seg>
<seg id="4">It so happened that an aircraft of the US Air became a plane in reality and landed in the Hudson River.</seg>
<seg id="5">The only information so far known is that the "terrorists" belonged to the species of goose.</seg>

<seg id="8">My own jaw has started giving pain due to half an hour's walk outdoors.</seg>
<seg id="9">Just imagine what would have happened to people who jumped out of the plane into the river.</seg>
<seg id="10">The happy news is that all of them remained saved.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the painful news is that in the time of this financial crisis, the company's plane sunk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Looking at all this, I reached New Jersey using the West Side Highway; I even saw that south bound was closed, but why did I still do this?</seg>
<seg id="13">Upon returning, I got trapped up in that rush.</seg>
<seg id="14">Thank God that during my one-hour's trip, the rush had cleared to such an extent that I got the exit to 56th Street.</seg>

<seg id="1">We have been considering the Sawati Taliban group as uncivilized, who were fed up with only female education.</seg>
<seg id="2">They were demonstrating this unhappiness at one place or the other by demolishing schools or colleges for women.</seg>
<seg id="3">But like many assumptions, this, too, has not been proven true; according to CNN, on the holy day of Monday, the Taliban blasted a boys school.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sawat, Taliban demolish a boys school.</seg>
<seg id="5">The girls schools were actually demolished first following a famous English proverb saying "ladies first"; we don't know why people are still bent upon calling the Taliban uncivilized, uncultured and barbarous.</seg>
<seg id="6">Another allegation against the Taliban that also becomes clear from this is that the Taliban are not only against the education of girls is not correct.</seg>
<seg id="7">But they are totally against education by the grace of God.</seg>
<seg id="8">May Allah give these fighters more strength and</seg>
<seg id="9">help them uproot the cruel government imposed upon us</seg>

<seg id="1">This is the age of the computer, and its intervention is getting higher in every walk of life.</seg>
<seg id="2">Many people have reservations about this growing intervention of the computer, e.g. in financial affairs.</seg>
<seg id="3">Where the use of credit card facilitates you, it also becomes a source of improving the grip of law enforcement agencies upon your private life</seg>
<seg id="4">that now your whereabouts can be traced just through financial dealings, for example the use of credit card.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the future, when the use of real currency will get minimized to a greater extent, its usefulness will increase.</seg>
<seg id="6">In the same way, in the criminal world too, instead of taking the risk of bank burglary, the credit card information is stolen.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the same way, building friendship is also being done through computer resources.</seg>
<seg id="8">Social networking Web sites, e.g. Orkut, Facebook and Myspace, are rated first in terms of popularity.</seg>

<seg id="10">In a similar manner, there are matchmaking Web sites in which your likes are matched with other peoples' likes and a list of compatible people is shown to you.</seg>
<seg id="11">Can you live your life with another person exactly similar to you?</seg>

<seg id="2">In accordance with both our religion and the laws of Pakistan, innocent children should live with their mothers.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the Indo-Pak subcontinent, we accepted Islam centuries ago, but could not get rid of irrational beliefs till today and gave preference to customs and traditions upon religion.</seg>

<seg id="3">As a result of blindly following the culture of Western nations, we regard Purdah and virtuousness as outdated concepts.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the new American policy about Afghanistan, war has been accorded preference over the development.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the officials, Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achieving American targets in Afghanistan, because corruption prevails in the government, the drugs business has increased, and the Taliban are gaining strength.</seg>

<seg id="6">According to them, this policy has come up after the departure of President Bush, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai every two weeks to emphasize the American role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and its civic institutions.</seg>
<seg id="7">The officials said that the Obama administration will work with provincial leaders as a substitute for the central government.</seg>
