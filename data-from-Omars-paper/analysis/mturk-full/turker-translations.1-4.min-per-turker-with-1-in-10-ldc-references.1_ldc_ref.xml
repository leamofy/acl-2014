    <seg id="3">this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">in an interview with US news, Thomas Reid said that in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's rule, China experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reid said that based to many reasons, he has a belief that China had experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">the reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">he further added that this was the reason that in 1998 only in a span of two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments as a reply to Indian nuclear experiments.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that the test of the Atom Bomb which Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998, was made with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reeds was questioned that China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan then he said in reply that because India was a common enemy for Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that there is a proof to this too that Doctor Abdul Qadeer Khan used Chinese design and after this the documents which were acquired from Libia also confirms this statement.</seg>
    <seg id="12">On a one more question that doing combined nuclear tests is common then he said that in 1990 America conducted a nuclear test for Britain on open belt in Nevada desert.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that we guess that too that Israel was given access to the results of this test.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reed was also questioned that Is the Chinese Nuclear spread program is continuing?</seg>
    <seg id="15">On this Thomas Reed said that china has been supplying raw material, instructions and design to nuclear facility in Iran's city Isfahan since 1990.</seg>

    <seg id="15">Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. moreover Germany has sent its special ambassador to Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance, it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.</seg>
    <seg id="16">its proof is the Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.</seg>

    <seg id="2">Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany left a huge business group behind him.</seg>
    <seg id="3">but a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.</seg>
    <seg id="4">when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.</seg>
    <seg id="5">The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 to one Billion Euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle went into deep pressure.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had got to this position from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic powet.</seg>
    <seg id="8">After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quick, putting it on new lines.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm, Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm always had special importance.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.</seg>
    <seg id="14">After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have sanctioned 400 million Euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.</seg>

    <seg id="9">Dr Patricia teaches Medicine in Mew Clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She has done extensive research on older age and the ability to exercise with increasing age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">A team of doctors used High Frequency rays to determine the functioning of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="12">In which, the ability of the heart to pump blood, and it's ability to shrink and relax was researched.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Experts have concentrated mainly on the left side of the heart which is mainly responsible for the pumping of blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They discovered that with increase in age, the problems in the rate of heart relaxation also increase.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says that with increase in age, the problems in the heart relaxation rates increases and thus effects the ability to exercise with growing age.</seg>

     <seg id="2">And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="3">To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.</seg>
     <seg id="5">From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.</seg>
     <seg id="6">But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.</seg>
     <seg id="7">We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.</seg>
     <seg id="8">It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God</seg>
     <seg id="9">This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.</seg>
     <seg id="10">It was not even 30 minutes for us working that our younger son said “Dad it feels like I am not born for this job.</seg>
     <seg id="11">We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="12">Son started saying that I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work .</seg>
     <seg id="13">Three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home.</seg>
     <seg id="14">What it means is that when a man decides the destination no matter what were the motives behind this no one can stop him from getting it.</seg>
