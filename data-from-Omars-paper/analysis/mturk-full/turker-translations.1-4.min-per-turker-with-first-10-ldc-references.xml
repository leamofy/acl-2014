   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.</seg>
    <seg id="3">In this book, called 'Nuclear Express', the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News, that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reid said that due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Among the factors are the design of the bomb, and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He further added that that was the reason that Pakistan was able to reply to India's Nuclear test with a nuclear test in just 2 weeks and 3 days.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961, Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test, in response to which America took 17 days to preform a test, despite having this bomb for a long time.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that the test of the Atom Bomb which Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998, was made with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reeds was questioned that China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan then he said in reply that because India was a common enemy for Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that there is a proof to this too that Doctor Abdul Qadeer Khan used Chinese design and after this the documents which were acquired from Libia also confirms this statement.</seg>
    <seg id="12">On a one more question that doing combined nuclear tests is common then he said that in 1990 America conducted a nuclear test for Britain on open belt in Nevada desert.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that we guess that too that Israel was given access to the results of this test.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reed was also questioned that Is the Chinese Nuclear spread program is continuing?</seg>
    <seg id="15">On this Thomas Reed said that china has been supplying raw material, instructions and design to nuclear facility in Iran's city Isfahan since 1990.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Other than that china also provided Iran a nuclear enrichment plant.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libia and Yemen thorough North Korea.</seg>

    <seg id="3">Exercise is good for health in every age</seg>
    <seg id="4">This keeps the heart healthy,reduces the level of cholesterol,Helps in keeping the weight low, helps in reduction of sugar and reduces Alzheimer meaning decreases the speed of dementia.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Unfortunately, in many people with the increase in the age, the capability to carryout exercise also decreases.</seg>
    <seg id="6">The specialists say that with exercise our body and brain remain active but age can have effect on it.</seg>
    <seg id="7">The American Medical Association says that Many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Pattricia P. Leka of Maya clinic Minnesota says that increase in age is a big reason for being handicapped from exercise and less physical activity.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She headed a research regarding heart diseases and man's ability to do exercise in older age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart.</seg>
    <seg id="12">In which heart's activity of pumping blood and its contraction and relaxation was studied.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They came to know that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says with increase in age, problems occur in the activity of relaxation of heart and with increase in age, this effects the ability to exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that we were surprised to see that it has an effect  and it confirmed that bad exercising ability is very much related to the heart relaxing activity.</seg>
    <seg id="18">In some instances, blood pressure is a factor in heart anomalies and heart diseases.</seg>
    <seg id="19">If doctors and patients can work together when it comes to heart diseases, then they can enjoy the benefits of exercise even with older age.</seg>

     <seg id="1">One Muslim League N was left, even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to People's Party.</seg>
     <seg id="2">Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q have made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment in the National Assembly and the Senate.</seg>
     <seg id="3">Till now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.</seg>
     <seg id="4">This is the reason why  no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.</seg>
     <seg id="5">It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part that is they will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft, government speaker did not take any action.</seg>
     <seg id="6">MQM is i coalation with government, Muslim League(N) is secret partnership with government and Muslim League(Q) is the party that passed 17Th ammendment, then how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17Th Amendment</seg>
     <seg id="7">This is the way to get ones name entered in the list of martyrs by just getting painted.</seg>
     <seg id="8">The Peoples Party is otherwise not in hurry to end the seventeenth ammendment.</seg>
     <seg id="9">How any one can think of getting his own hands cut.</seg>
     <seg id="10">Seventeenth Ammendment cannot be abolished till Zardari is the President.</seg>
     <seg id="11">This was the opinion of majority in one of our survey and it is also correct.</seg>
     <seg id="12">Zardari would not have opted to be the President, if seventeenth ammendment was to be abolished.</seg>
     <seg id="13">Now he is more powerful than President Musharraf, since along with President he is also  the chairman of Peoples Party.</seg>
     <seg id="14">The seventeenth ammendment is there till he is the president.</seg>
     <seg id="15">Political Parties will have to remove President Zardari first, in order to abolish  the seventeenth ammendment.</seg>

     <seg id="1">Most elders of our family belonged to labor class.</seg>
     <seg id="2">And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="3">To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.</seg>
     <seg id="5">From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.</seg>
     <seg id="6">But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.</seg>
     <seg id="7">We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.</seg>
     <seg id="8">It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God</seg>
     <seg id="9">This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.</seg>
     <seg id="10">It was only half an hour since he started working that the little boy said " Daddy, I am not born to do this"</seg>
     <seg id="11">I said that if this is true then study a lot like us and get rid of the physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="12">The son said, "I am studying and I will get through it also but it is the work that I can not do"</seg>
     <seg id="13">Whatsoever we did that work in three hours  and came back home.</seg>
     <seg id="14">The point of saying is that if a person picks his destiny, whatever is the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving that destiny.</seg>

     <seg id="2">Benazir, for her selfish purpose, crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs after giving the list of their names who were fighting for freedom on one hand and on the other gave India the chance to keep its full attention on Kashmir after them helping to suppress Punjab Movement.</seg>
     <seg id="3">Tug of war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history, which has pushed the country back many years.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Benazir continued to give negative comments on Kashmir and the nuclear program after being exiled.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Benazir made a deal with Pervez Musharraf while betraying the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif.</seg>
     <seg id="6">During her reign Benazir provided her husband the opportunity of making money and because of this he popularized as Mr. 10 percent.</seg>
     <seg id="7">Benazir brother was killed during her reign whose assassins are still safe.</seg>
     <seg id="8">Though a woman still Benazir avoided to fight for the rights of women.</seg>

     <seg id="1">It has been 37 years since the separation of eastern Pakistan, and sadly no leader condemns this day nor do they call it a black day.</seg>
     <seg id="2">It should have been so that we would celebrate this 16th September as a black day, and take steps so such a sad incident never takes place again.</seg>
     <seg id="3">On this day we should have send the Bangali's letters of consolation and tried to bring them closer to ourselves.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Now we look at the reasons why eastern Pakistan was separated.</seg>
     <seg id="5">They used to make arrangements to bring back the Bahari's stuck in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.</seg>
     <seg id="6">But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.</seg>
     <seg id="7">We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.</seg>
     <seg id="8">Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines of life from the next day.</seg>
     <seg id="9">Only if East and West Pakistan could be one together just like East and West Germany was united once again.</seg>
     <seg id="10">We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.</seg>

     <seg id="3">that America is with his government. But he is forgetting that last year the same people was with Parvez Musharaf.</seg>
     <seg id="4">This picture has been taken as it was a family gathering</seg>
     <seg id="5">A photo like this was never published in the papers before; one president with three American officials.</seg>
     <seg id="6">It seems the American involvement in Pakistan has increased and more than one official is needed to do the job; or they are not relying on their new puppet the way they relied on the one before him.</seg>
     <seg id="7">This could also have been arranged keeping in mind the stories of President Zardari’s breach of commitments.</seg>

     <seg id="4">Just as Bush's rule began to close, he started to worry about the end of his own rule, and he struck a deal with thieves in the dark.</seg>

     <seg id="6">Whether in Bajod or Swat, the army cannot control terror, and instead they bomb the 'enemy', i.e. the public. Apart from loss of life and money, if they are making the 'enemy' psychologically ill, then we are the enemies, aren't we?</seg>

     <seg id="3">On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.</seg>
     <seg id="4">The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.</seg>
     <seg id="5">The result is that on the one side the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other hand the Taliban has established their hold.</seg>
     <seg id="6">In between who got grinded, the poor citizens.</seg>
     <seg id="7">It is said that in Swat somebody asked, which type of people are the Taliban's are? The answer was  "very good people because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country".</seg>
