     <seg id="1">First Nuclear Test Done in 1990.</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer, had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.</seg>
    <seg id="3">In this book called 'Nuclear Express,' the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reid said that due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Among the factors are the design of the bomb and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He further added that that was the reason that Pakistan was able to reply to India's Nuclear test with a nuclear test, in just 2 weeks and 3 days.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminded us that in 1961, Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test. In response, America took 17 days to preform a test, despite having this bomb for a long time.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He added that the atomic bomb, which was tested on May 19th, 1998, by Pakistan, was engineered very carefully and that Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reid was asked whether China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he merely mentioned that India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that there was proof that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and that the documents received from Libya will verify this fact.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Upon further questioning as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that it was believed that Israel also has access to the results of this testing.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reid was also asked about China's current nuclear distribution program.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Thomas Reid answered that China has been providing raw material, guidance, and design for the nuclear setup in Asfahan, Iran, since 1991.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Apart from this, China also provided Iran with the nuclear enrichment plant in Kheraj.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He said that China has been providing Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, and Libya with nuclear technology through North Korea.</seg>

    <seg id="6">But in reality the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.</seg>
    <seg id="7">As the head of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is even weaker than before.</seg>
    <seg id="8">And on top of that the internal issues have made it helpless.</seg>
    <seg id="9">On the other hand, the French president Sarkozy is behaving as if he is still the president of the European Union.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Whereas France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it.</seg>

    <seg id="6">When a product is being advertised we are able to gather more information such as it's name, price, benefits, and availability in short. It is a brief actual account of itself.</seg>
    <seg id="7">But sometimes the drafted messages tend to be too fictional, owing to either exaggeration or to false claims made by the advertiser. Viewed objectively; the advertising message must act as a salesperson and do it's best to convinced consumer of the merits of the product.</seg>
    <seg id="8">The words used in advertisements are typical of a salesperson's language and this is how he would like to convince his prospective buyer; should they come face to face.</seg>
    <seg id="9">The name of this advertisement is Ratiopharm. The words used by the salesperson definitely praise the product or service that is available.</seg>
    <seg id="10">More often they are colorful and catchy words as they persuade the customer to respond favorably and persuade him to purchase the product. Unless cosmetics and other like Kassbohrer products are heavily promoted, they will languish unsold on the shelves of this stores for a long time.</seg>
    <seg id="11">So advertising always puts forward the best points of the product. Advertisement can be educative, entertaining, informative handy and surely interesting.</seg>
    <seg id="12">At times, however, they tend to be boring, irritating, and incredibly embarrassing.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Another category of advertisements tends to brag so as to tempt the buyers.</seg>
