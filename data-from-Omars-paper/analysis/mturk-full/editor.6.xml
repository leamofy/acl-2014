     <seg id="1">Not dieting in order to avoid flu.</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">This research from the American Scientists is from the experiments on rats.</seg>
    <seg id="3">It has been proven from experiments that rats put on a diet with less calories had less ability to resist the Flu virus.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Research has proven the old myth wrong that its better to fast during fever.</seg>
    <seg id="5">According to the scientists one should eat a lot during fever.</seg>
    <seg id="6">The researchers from the Michigan State University say that the rats on a diet had less power to resist the infection and their chances of dying had increased, whereas rats on a normal diet had better resistance against the flu virus.</seg>
    <seg id="7">In many modern countries it is sometimes fashionable to think that, by free education for all-whether rich or poor, clever or stupid- one can solve all the problems of the society.</seg>
    <seg id="8">But we can already see that free education for all is not enough; we find in such countries a far larger number of people with university degrees than there are jobs for them to fill.</seg>

   <hl>
     <seg id="1">This plan of education was implemented on 1990.</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Because of their degrees, they refuse to do what they think is low work and in fact work with the hands is thought to be dirty and shameful in such countries.</seg>
    <seg id="3">The work of a completely uneducated farmer is far more important than that of a professor: we can live without education, but we die if we have no food. If no one cleaned our streets and took the rubbish away from our houses, we would get terrible diseases in our towns.</seg>
    <seg id="4">In fact, when we say that all of us must be educated to fit us for life, it means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Education is not an end but a means to an end. In other words we do not educate children only for the purpose of educating them.</seg>
    <seg id="6">When men become organized into very large groups then civilization develops.</seg>
    <seg id="7">It is possible to get freedom from hunger, thirst, cold, heat and many diseases, so that each person can live a happier life than he could.</seg>
    <seg id="8">It means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited to his brain and ability, and secondly, that we can realize that all jobs are necessary to society and that is very bad to be ashamed of ones work or to scorn someone else.</seg>

    <seg id="13">It is predicted that Israel also has access to the results of this experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reeds was also asked if China is continuing nuclear proliferation?</seg>
    <seg id="15">Thomas Reeds said, "China has been supplying raw material, instructions, and the design to a nuclear facility in Asfahan Iran."</seg>
    <seg id="16">Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.</seg>
    <seg id="17">Reeds states, "China had been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Rome, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen via North Korea."</seg>

   </hl>
    <seg id="2">On Tuesday the journalist organization RIUJ held protests in front of the Islamabad Press Club of journalists and newspaper workers against media owners, the government's control over news channels and newspapers firing many of their employees.</seg>
    <seg id="3">Speaking to the protesters, senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, Federal Union of Journalists,  C.R. Shamsi said that the politicians who had used to protest with them until yesterday on the streets had now become parliament rulers. He added that they are not doing anything as yet for the rights of the journalists due to fearing lobbying from media moguls.</seg>
    <seg id="4">He added that the newspaper owners who "speak of human rights" have made their offices "punishment houses" and "beggar camps", where despite earning millions of Rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are "killing them" economically.</seg>
    <seg id="5">An example of this is the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or facing several months of outstanding wages, many workers are leading very difficult lives.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Shamai stated that there should be firm steps taken against the TV and newspaper owners, and the journalists should put a protest camp in front of the parliament to get their rights.</seg>
    <seg id="7">C.R. Shamsi criticized the governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, saying that employees were removed from his Urdu Newspaper 'Aaj Kal' staff, without prior notice.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Wheras Junah daily, Khabrein daily, Channel 5, Burns Plus TV and Aaj TV have removed dozens of workers.</seg>

   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Looking at it from the government's point of view, the efforts by the European Union to stop the war in the Middle East have been decisive.</seg>
    <seg id="3">According to the Brussels official position, the Shoarzan Berg Group or Sarkozy's efforts are symbolic to the seriousness of the matter.</seg>
    <seg id="4">European Commission's Spokesman Amadeu Altafa said, "Every effort is commendable that can help a unified message from the European Union to reach the warring sides."</seg>
    <seg id="5">In light of the government's statement, all seems to be fine.</seg>
    <seg id="6">But in reality, the European Union is presenting a view of conflict amongst themselves regarding the war in the Middle East, which is very sad.</seg>
    <seg id="7">The role of the Czech Republic's president is already very weak.</seg>
    <seg id="8">In addition, the internal turmoil has nullified the effects of peace efforts elsewhere.</seg>
    <seg id="9">On the other side, French president Sarkozy's role seems to indicate that he is still working as the president of the European Union.</seg>
    <seg id="10">This is despite the fact that France's 6 month presidential term has expired.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Sarkozy wishes to play the role of the leader, but he lacks the authority to do so.</seg>
    <seg id="12">French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner is facing a most amusing situation.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Kouchner is part of a delegation headed by the foreign minister of Czech republic Schwarzenberg.</seg>
    <seg id="14">The problem is both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements about war in the Middle East.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. moreover Germany has sent its special ambassador to Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance, it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.</seg>
    <seg id="16">This is proof positive showing Israel and the nation's leaders do not care about any efforts to reconcile with the European Union.</seg>
    <seg id="17">This is a golden chance for the European Union to do something, since America (due to the policies of George W. Bush) has already failed in the Middle East.</seg>

   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany, left a huge business group behind him.</seg>
    <seg id="3">Until recently, the average German citizen knew almost nothing about Merckle's business enterprises.</seg>
    <seg id="4">When Merckle negotiated with 30 different banks to secure financing for his industrial group, his business interests became the topic of national headlines and he foresaw this unwanted attention as potentially damaging to the future of his previously secretive business empire.</seg>
    <seg id="5">The Merkle group had to face the loss of a few hundred million euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company Volkswagen.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 million to one billion euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle was under intense pressure.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had got to this position from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic power.</seg>
    <seg id="8">After the death of his father, Adolf Merkel took over his family business and developed it quickly, putting on new lines.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 billion and 6 billion euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion euros a year. After the superb success of Ratiopharm, the Merkel Group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The number of employees of the Merkel Group around the world is near 100,000, and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical company Ratiopharm, always had special importance.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years."</seg>
    <seg id="14">After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have approved 400 million euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Therefore, after Adolf Merkeley's demise, the Merkeley Group came to an end.</seg>

    <seg id="5">Unfortunately the ability to exercise decreases for many people as they age.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active however age can affect it.</seg>
    <seg id="7">According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise from not doing exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr. Palecca teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the mechanics of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="12">In which the pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.</seg>
    <seg id="13">The experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They learned that as people grew old, there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Palecca says that as age increases, the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear, and this affects the ability to exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Garwin Cain was also a part of this study.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this. And this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="18">Sometimes blood pressure can be a cause of heart disease, as it can cause complications in the working of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="19">If the doctor and patent work together they can achieve the benefits  of exercise despite the patients advanced age.</seg>
    <seg id="20">A more detailed report on these complications and treatments has been published in the American Medical Association's magazine.</seg>

     <seg id="4">This is why no fuss was made in the assembly or on the floor of senate over this amendment, and the parliament was not forced into accepting the amendment.</seg>
     <seg id="5">It looks as if the parties just wanted to get the thing off their backs by submitting the rough versions, so that tomorrow, they may say that we had submitted our versions of the amendment, but the government speaker did not take action.</seg>

     <seg id="11">In our survey, this is the opinion of the majority and therefore so is the truth.</seg>
     <seg id="12">If the seventeenth amendment were to be repealed, then Zardari would never had become the president.</seg>
     <seg id="13">Now he is even more powerful than president Musharaf, as long as, besides being the president, he is also the chairman of the People's party.</seg>
     <seg id="14">As long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.</seg>
     <seg id="15">In order to cancel the seventeenth amendment, the political parties will first have to dismiss President Zardari from the presidency.</seg>
