     <seg id="1">'First nuclear experiment was done in 1990'</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reid, who has worked in the Lever National Laboratory in America as a weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the former director of technical intelligence at Los Alamos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.</seg>
    <seg id="3">This book was titled "Nuclear Express: Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation," and both writers have claimed that whichever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or had the support of another nuclear power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">In an interview with U.S. news agencies, Thomas Reid said that in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's rule, China experimented with Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reid said that for many reasons, he believes that China had experimented with Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">The reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He further added that this was the reason that in 1998 in a span of only two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments in response to Indian nuclear experiments.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminds us that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiments.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that atomic bomb test Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998 was made with extreme care, and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reeds was questioned about China providing nuclear technology to Pakistan he replied that India was a common enemy for Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that there is a proof that Doctor Abdul Qadeer Khan used Chinese designs, and the documents which were acquired from Libya confirm this statement.</seg>
    <seg id="12">He further stated that doing combined nuclear tests is common, and that in 1990 the United States conducted a nuclear test for Britain on an open belt in the Nevada desert.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that he also assumed that Israel was given access to the results of this test.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reed was also questioned whether the Chinese nuclear spread program is continuing?</seg>
    <seg id="15">On this, Thomas Reed said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and design to a nuclear facility in Iran's city Isfahan since 1990.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Additionally, China provided Iran a nuclear enrichment plant.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen thorough North Korea.</seg>

    <seg id="3">Speaking to the protesters, senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, Federal Union of Journalists, C.R.

    <seg id="4">He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.</seg>
    <seg id="5">An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.</seg>
    <seg id="6">He said that there should be firm steps taken against the TV and newspaper owners, and the journalists should put a protest camp in front of the parliament to get their rights.</seg>

    <seg id="3">According to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.</seg>
    <seg id="4">The European Union's spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, has said that every such effort is appreciated which is helpful in sending the European Union's message to the opponents of the war.</seg>
    <seg id="5">It seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned.</seg>
    <seg id="6">In reality, the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.</seg>
    <seg id="7">As the head of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is even weaker than before.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Also, the internal issues have made it helpless.</seg>
    <seg id="9">On the other hand, the French President, Sarkozy, is behaving as if he is still the President of the European Union.</seg>
    <seg id="10">France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play a leading role, and he is capable of it, but he does not have the permission to do so.</seg>
    <seg id="12">The most funny situation is faced by the French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of Czech republic Schwarzenberg.</seg>

    <seg id="15">Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right of self defense whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. moreover Germany has sent its special ambassador to Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance, it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.</seg>
    <seg id="16">The proof for this is,  Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.</seg>

    <seg id="3">but a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.</seg>
    <seg id="4">when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.</seg>
    <seg id="5">The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 and  one billion euro loan it needed immediately , so Merkle went into deep pressure.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had gone from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic power.</seg>
    <seg id="8">After the death of his father, Adolf Merkel took over his family business. He developed it quick, putting it on new lines.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm,the  Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm, always had special importance.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine."</seg>
    <seg id="13">Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the management of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.</seg>

   </hl>
    <seg id="3">Exercise at any age is good for your health.</seg>
    <seg id="4">It energizes your heart, reduces cholesterol levels, helps in keeping weight low, helps to prevent diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer's or dementia.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Unfortunately the ability to exercise decreases for many people as they age.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active however age can affect it.</seg>
    <seg id="7">According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise from not doing exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Patricia Palecca, of Mayo Clinic Minnesota, says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to exercise and lack of bodily activity.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="12">The pumping of the blood by the heart - its contraction and relaxation - was studied.</seg>
    <seg id="13">The experts focused on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They learned that as people grew older there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says that as age increases the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear and this affects the ability to exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Garwin Cain was also a part of this study.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that they were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this and that this clearly proves how deep of a relationship there is between the decrease of exercise and the relaxation of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="18">Some times blood pressure can cause disorders in the heart such as its functions and heart diseases.</seg>
    <seg id="19">If the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard, then they can take advantage of the benefits of exercise even with age.</seg>
    <seg id="20">A detailed report in this matter is published in a magazine of the American Medical Association.</seg>
