     <seg id="1">First Nuclear Test Done in 1990.</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer, had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.</seg>
    <seg id="3">In this book called 'Nuclear Express,' the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reid said that due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Among the factors are the design of the bomb and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He further added that that was the reason that Pakistan was able to reply to India's Nuclear test with a nuclear test, in just 2 weeks and 3 days.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminded us that in 1961, Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test. In response, America took 17 days to preform a test, despite having this bomb for a long time.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that atomic bomb test Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998 was made with extreme care, and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reeds was questioned about China providing nuclear technology to Pakistan he replied that India was a common enemy for Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that there is a proof that Doctor Abdul Qadeer Khan used Chinese designs, and the documents which were acquired from Libya confirm this statement.</seg>
    <seg id="12">He further stated that doing combined nuclear tests is common, and that in 1990 the United States conducted a nuclear test for Britain on an open belt in the Nevada desert.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that he also assumed that Israel was given access to the results of this test.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reed was also questioned whether the Chinese nuclear spread program is continuing?</seg>
    <seg id="15">On this, Thomas Reed said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and design to a nuclear facility in Iran's city Isfahan since 1990.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Additionally, China provided Iran a nuclear enrichment plant.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen thorough North Korea.</seg>

   </hl>
    <seg id="2">On Tuesday the organization of journalists RIUJ held protests in front of the Islamabad Press Club against media owners and the government about the news channel and newspapers removing many of their employees.</seg>
    <seg id="3">Speaking to the protesters, senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, Federal Union of Journalists, C.R. Shamsi said that the politicians used to protest with us until yesterday on the streets, today they have become rulers and are sitting in the parliament. Fearing a certain lobby of the media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of the journalists.</seg>
    <seg id="4">He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.</seg>
    <seg id="5">An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.</seg>
    <seg id="6">He said that there should be firm steps taken against the TV and newspaper owners, and the journalists should put a protest camp in front of the parliament to get their rights.</seg>
    <seg id="7">C.R. Shamsi criticized the governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, saying that employees were removed from his Urdu Newspaper "Aaj Kal" staff without prior notice.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Wheras Junah daily, Khabrein daily, Channel 5, Burns Plus TV and Aaj TV have removed dozens of workers.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Speaking to the protestors, the General Secretary of PUFJ said that today, throughout the country, journalist organizations are observing a black day against the removal of journalists and newspaper workers, whereas journalists will go to the parliamentary session wearing black bands on their arms to get back their rights.</seg>
    <seg id="10">According to Mazhar Abbas, in 50% of the Pakistani newspapers and TV channels the workers and journalists were being exploited, where they work without any agreement.</seg>

     <seg id="1">Why reduce exercise with the age?</seg>
     <seg id="2">new research</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="3">exercise at any age is good for health.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Exercise energizes your heart, reduces your cholesterol level, helps in keeping your weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer or dementia.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.</seg>
    <seg id="6">experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active, however, age can affect it.</seg>
    <seg id="7">According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Patricia P. Leka of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says that an increase in age is a big reason for man's decrease in exercise and physical activity.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She headed research regarding heart disease and a man's ability to do exercise in older age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">A team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="12">They studied how the heart contracts and relaxes as it pumps blood.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is responsible for pumping blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They came to know that as age increases, problems increase in the relaxation action of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says with an increase in age, problems occur in the relaxation of heart and this effects the ability to exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that they were surprised to see that it has an effect, as it confirmed that poor exercising ability is closely related to the heart's relaxation phase.</seg>
    <seg id="18">Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.</seg>
    <seg id="19">If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart, they can achieve the benefits of excercise, despite the increase in age.</seg>
    <seg id="20">A detailed report of this has been published in the American Medical Association's magazine.</seg>

     <seg id="2">In our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor, we used to pray to Allah: Please save us from this hard labor.</seg>
     <seg id="3">To avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what we should do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor.</seg>
     <seg id="4">The editor wrote in reply that we should select certain subjects and become doctors or engineers.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Right from beginning my trend was toward engineering and I had selected technical drawing instead of biology as well.</seg>
     <seg id="6">But at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor.</seg>
     <seg id="7">I studied biology for hardly a month and then when nothing worked out, I took math as an alternate subject.</seg>
     <seg id="8">Fear of labor made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.</seg>
     <seg id="9">I remembered that when I along with my two sons were trying to remove the carpets from our old house.</seg>
     <seg id="10">It had been not even half an hour that we were working when the small son said, "Daddy, it seems that I am not born for this job."</seg>

     <seg id="13">Any we three managed to complete the work within three hours and returned home.</seg>
