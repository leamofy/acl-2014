    <seg id="4">This makes your heart stronger, decreases cholesterol levels, helps in reducing weight, helps stop diabetes and decreases the chances of Alzheimer's. </seg>
    <seg id="5">Unfortunately, a lot of people tend to exercise less with age. </seg>
    <seg id="6">Experts say that exercise keeps our minds and bodies alert, and affects the real age of a person. </seg>
    <seg id="7">According to the American Medical Association, not getting enough exercise can lead to numerous health issues. </seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Patricia Paylekka of the Mew Clinic of Minnesota reports that with the increase in age, exercise is a major factor in determining proper body functioning. </seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr Patricia teaches medicine at the Mew Clinic. </seg>
    <seg id="10">She has done extensive research on older age and the ability to exercise with the increase of age. </seg>
    <seg id="11">A team of doctors have used high frequency rays to determine the functioning of the heart. </seg>
    <seg id="12">The ability of the heart to pump blood, and it's ability to shrink and relax was researched. </seg>
    <seg id="13">Experts have concentrated mainly on the left side of the heart, which is mainly responsible for the pumping of blood. </seg>
    <seg id="14">They discovered that with increase in age, the problems in the rate of heart, relaxation also increase. </seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says that with increase in age, the problems in the heart relaxation rates increases and thus effects the ability to exercise with growing age. </seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Carwin Cain was also part of this research. </seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that it's surprising to see the permanent effects of improper exercise on the heart. </seg>
    <seg id="18">In some instances, blood pressure is a factor in both heart anomalies and diseases. </seg>
