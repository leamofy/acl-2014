   </hl>
    <seg id="2">The meeting of the committee took place in the parliament house under the chairmanship of the committee chairman Mushahid Husain Syed, in which they proposed to the government to send a delegation, with representatives of all political parties apart from the humanitarian aid to Palestine.</seg>
    <seg id="3">Speaking to representatives of the press after the meeting, Mushahid Husain Syed said that the committee welcomed the proposal given by France, in which it was stated that Israel calls for an immediate ceasefire and allows humanitarian work among the affected people of Gaza.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Calling the Israeli attacks on Palestine a crime against humanity, he said that all countries should criticize these attacks.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Mushahid Husain made the double standards of the countries of the world a target of his attack, and asked why are those who speak against terrorism, quiet about the Israeli attacks on Palestine?</seg>
    <seg id="6">The chairman of the standing Committee of External Affairs in the Senate also targeted the leaders of Muslim nation who were taking a quiet stance on the matter of Palestine.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He said that the committee expressed hope that the newly elected American President Barack Obama would speak to the Muslim nation within the first 100 days of his government, in order to bridge the gulf forming between American and the Muslim nation.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Mushahid Husain Syed said that the gap formed between the Muslim nation and the West should be filled by taking not only sudden steps but also by solving long standing issues like that of Kashmir and Palestine.</seg>
    <seg id="9">The minister of foreign affairs, Malik Imad, told the committee that he was going to Saudi Arabia to attend the meeting of the foreign ministers of the governments of Islamic countries.</seg>

     <seg id="1">Abstain From Dieting To Avoid Flu</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">This finding by American scientists resulted from experimentation on rats.</seg>
    <seg id="3">It was demonstrated in these experiments that rats on low-calorie diets had lessened ability to resist the flu virus.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Research has proven wrong the old belief that it is good to fast when one has a fever.</seg>
    <seg id="5">According to the scientists, one should eat a lot when one has a fever.</seg>
    <seg id="6">The researchers, who work at Michigan State University, say that rats who were dieting had a lessened ability to resist infection and had an increased mortality rate, whereas rats on a normal dietary regimen had better resistance against the flu virus.</seg>
    <seg id="7">In many modern countries it has for sometime been fashionable to think that, by free education for all-whether rich or poor, clever or stupid-, one can solve all the problems of the society.</seg>
    <seg id="8">But we can already see that free education for all is not enough. We find in such countries a far larger number of people with University degrees than there are jobs for them to fill.</seg>
 </doc>
 <doc docid="BBC_URD_20090103.0021" genre="nw">
   <hl>
     <seg id="1">This plan of education was implemented on 1990.</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Because of their degrees, they refuse to do what they think low work and in fact work with the hands is thought to be dirty and shameful in such countries.</seg>
    <seg id="3">The work of a completely uneducated farmer is far more important than that of a professor: we can live without education, but we die if we have no food. If no one cleaned our streets and took the rubbish away from our houses, we should get terrible diseases in our towns.</seg>
    <seg id="4">In fact, when we say that all of us must be educated to fit us for life, it means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Education is not an end but a means to an end. In other words we do not educate children only for the purpose of educating them.</seg>
    <seg id="6">When men become organized into very large groups, a civilization develops.</seg>
    <seg id="7">It is possible to get freedom from hunger, thirst, cold, heat and many diseases, so that each person can live a happier life than he could.</seg>
    <seg id="8">It means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited to his brain and ability, and secondly, that we can realize that all jobs are necessary to society and that it is very bad to be ashamed of ones work or to scorn someone elses.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that on May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with a lot of care and that Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reed was asked a question on whether China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan, he replied that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that there is evidence that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan has used the Chinese model. Later the documents received from Libya also confirm this.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Another question that is it common is on nuclear experiments. He said that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that we also predicted that Israel has access to the results of this experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reeds was also asked if China is continuing nuclear proliferation.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw materials, instructions and designs to a nuclear facility of Iran in its city Asfahan.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He said that China had been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Rome, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen via North Korea.</seg>

   </hl>
    <seg id="2">On Tuesday the organization of journalists RIUJ held protests in front of the Islamabad Press Club against media owners and the government about the news channel and newspapers removing many of their employees.</seg>
    <seg id="3">Speaking to the protesters, senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, Federal Union of Journalists, C.R. Shamsi said that the politicians used to protest with us until yesterday on the streets, today they have become rulers and are sitting in the parliament. Fearing a certain lobby of the media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of the journalists.</seg>
    <seg id="4">He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.</seg>
    <seg id="5">An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.</seg>
    <seg id="6">He said that there should be firm steps taken against the TV and newspaper owners, and the journalists should put a protest camp in front of the parliament to get their rights.</seg>
    <seg id="7">C.R. Shamsi criticized the governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, saying that employees were removed from his Urdu Newspaper "Aaj Kal" staff without prior notice.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Wheras Junah daily, Khabrein daily, Channel 5, Burns Plus TV and Aaj TV have removed dozens of workers.</seg>

   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Looking at it from a governmental point of view, the efforts by the European Union to end the wars of the Middle East have been decisive.</seg>
    <seg id="3">The Shoarzan Berg Group or Sarkozy's efforts are symbolic to the seriousness of the matter, according to Brussels' official position.</seg>
    <seg id="4">The European Commission's Spokeperson Amadeu Altafa said that every effort is commendable and that can help a unified message from the European Union to reach the warring sides.</seg>
    <seg id="5">In light of the governments statement, everything thus far seems to be fine.</seg>
    <seg id="6">However, in reality, the European Union is presenting a view of conflict amongst each other, an idea that is very sad.</seg>
    <seg id="7">European Union's President Check Repuplic's role is already weak.</seg>
    <seg id="8">In addition, the internal turmoil has nullified the effect.</seg>
    <seg id="9">On the other side, French President Sarkozy's role seems to indicate that he is still working as the president of the European Union.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Despite the fact that France's 6-month presidential term has ended.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play a leader's role, a job he can do well, but he lacks the authorization to do it.</seg>
    <seg id="12">The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, is faced with a strange situation.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of the Czech Republic, Schwarzenberg.</seg>
    <seg id="14">The problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the Middle East war.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense, whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. Moreover, Germany has sent its special ambassador to the Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Its proof is the Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.</seg>
    <seg id="17">This is a golden chance for the European Union to do something since America, due to the policies of George W. Bush, has already failed in the Middle East.</seg>

   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany, left a huge business group behind him.</seg>
    <seg id="3">But, a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.</seg>
    <seg id="4">When he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines. Then he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.</seg>
    <seg id="5">The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700,000 to one billion euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle faced a lot of pressure.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had gotten to this position by going from being a small producer to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic powet.</seg>
    <seg id="8">After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quickly, putting it on a new track.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion euros a year. After the superb success of Ratiopharm, the Merkel group started buying many other institutions, which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement and car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is nearly 100,000; and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical manufacturer Ratiopharm, always had special importance.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine."</seg>
    <seg id="13">Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.</seg>
    <seg id="14">After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks sanctioned 400 million euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it can improve its financial conditions in the long term.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Therefore, after Adolf Merkeley's demise the Merkeley Group, which once existed, came to an end.</seg>

     <seg id="1">Why reduce exercise with the age?</seg>
     <seg id="2">new research</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="3">exercise at any age is good for health.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Exercise energizes your heart, reduces your cholesterol level, helps in keeping your weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer or dementia.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.</seg>
    <seg id="6">experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active, however, age can affect it.</seg>
    <seg id="7">According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Patricia Palecca of the Mayo Clinicin  Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to exercise and lack of bodily activity.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She led a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the workings of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="12">The pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.</seg>
    <seg id="13">The experts focused on the left part of the heart, which is the main part for pumping blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They learned that as people grow old, there is an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says that as age increases, the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear, and this affects the ability to exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Garwin  Cain was also a part of this study.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that they were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this. And this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="18">Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.</seg>
    <seg id="19">If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart, they can achieve the benefits of excercise, despite the increase in age.</seg>
    <seg id="20">A detailed report of this has been published in the American Medical Association's magazine.</seg>

    <seg id="9">He said that there are around 700 to 800 fighters present in Indian Kashmir, of whom almost 50% are foreigners.</seg>

     <seg id="2">In our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor, we used to pray to Allah: Please save us from this hard labor.</seg>
     <seg id="3">To avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what we should do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor.</seg>
     <seg id="4">The editor wrote in reply that we should select certain subjects and become doctors or engineers.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Right from beginning my trend was toward engineering and I had selected technical drawing instead of biology as well.</seg>

     <seg id="7">I studied biology for hardly a month and then when nothing worked out, I took math as an alternate subject.</seg>
     <seg id="8">Fear of labor made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.</seg>
     <seg id="9">I remembered that when I along with my two sons were trying to remove the carpets from our old house.</seg>
     <seg id="10">The little boy had only been working half an hour when he said,"Daddy, this is not what I was born to do!"</seg>
