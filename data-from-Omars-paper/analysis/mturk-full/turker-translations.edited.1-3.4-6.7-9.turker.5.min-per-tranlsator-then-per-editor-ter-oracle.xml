     <seg id="1">'First Nuclear Experiment was conducted in 1990'</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer, had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.</seg>
    <seg id="3">This book was titled "Nuclear Express: Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation," and both writers have claimed that whichever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or had the support of another nuclear power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990 during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reid said that, for many reasons, he believes that China had tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">The reasons include the design of the bomb and some information gained during talks with the Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He further added that this was the reason that in 1998 in a span of only two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments in response to Indian nuclear experiments.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reid reminds us that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiments.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He added that the atom bomb that was tested on May 19th 1998 by Pakistan was made very carefully, and that Pakistani scientists had complete faith in it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reid was asked whether China had provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that there was proof that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and that the documents received from Libya will verify this fact.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Upon further questioning as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that we also predicted that Israel has access to the results of this experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reid was also asked about China's nuclear distribution program which is ongoing.</seg>
    <seg id="15">In answer, Thomas Reid said that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Esfahan, Iran since 1991.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen through North Korea.</seg>

    <seg id="5">An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months.

    <seg id="9">He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm,the  Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.</seg>

     <seg id="13">Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf. Because with being the president, he is also the chairman of the People's Party.</seg>
     <seg id="14">As long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.</seg>

     <seg id="2">In our childhood, when we used to see our uncles doing labor work, we used to pray to Allah to save us from this hard work.</seg>
     <seg id="3">To avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what we should do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor.</seg>
     <seg id="4">The editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and study Science and Math subjects.</seg>
     <seg id="5">We were inclined towards engineering and in matriculation we studied Technical drawing instead of Biology.</seg>
     <seg id="6">But at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.</seg>
     <seg id="7">We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics. </seg>
     <seg id="8">Fear of labor made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.</seg>
     <seg id="9">I remembered this when I was trying to lift the carpet with my two young sons at our old house.</seg>
     <seg id="10">It was not half an hour since we started working, and the younger son said, "Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job."</seg>
     <seg id="11">We said that if that is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor. </seg>
     <seg id="12">The son said, "I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work."</seg>
     <seg id="13">Anyway, the three of us finished that work in three hours and returned.</seg>
     <seg id="14">My purpose of saying this is that if a person has set a goal, whatever be the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving his goal.</seg>
