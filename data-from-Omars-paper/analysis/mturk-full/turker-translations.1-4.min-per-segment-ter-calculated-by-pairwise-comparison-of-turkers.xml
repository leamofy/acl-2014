    <seg id="7">The role of Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak</seg>
    <seg id="8">plus internal affairs has made her helpless.</seg>
    <seg id="9">On the other hand the course of action of French President Sarkozy depicts that France is still the President of European Union.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Whereas France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it.</seg>
    <seg id="12">The most ridiculous situation faces the foreign minister of France, Bernard Kouchner.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He is in the delegation which is led by Schwarzenberg the Foreign Minister of Czech Republic.</seg>
