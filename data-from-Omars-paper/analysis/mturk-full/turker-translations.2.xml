   </hl>
    <seg id="2">This research from the American Scientists have come up after the experiments on rats.</seg>
    <seg id="3">in has been proven from experiments that rats put on diet with less calories had less ability to resist the Flu virus.</seg>
    <seg id="4">research has proven this old myth wrong that its better to fast during fever.</seg>
    <seg id="5">according to the scientists one should eat a lot during fever.</seg>
    <seg id="6">the researchers from the Michigan State University say that the rats on dieting had less power to resist the infection and their chances of dying had increased whereas rats on normal diet had better resistance against the Flu virus.</seg>
    <seg id="7">In many modern countries it has for sometime being fashionable to think that, by free education for all-whether rich or poor, clever or stupid- one can solve all the problems of the society.</seg>
    <seg id="8">But we can already see that free education for all is not enough; we find in such countries a far larger number of people with University degrees than there are jobs for them to fill.</seg>
 </doc>
 <doc docid="BBC_URD_20090103.0021" genre="nw">
   <hl>
     <seg id="1">This plan of education was implemented on 1990.</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Because of their degrees, they refuse to do what they think low work and in fact work with the hands is thought to be dirty and shameful in such countries.</seg>
    <seg id="3">The work of a completely uneducated farmer is far more important than that of a professor: we can live without education, but we die if we have no food. If no one cleaned our streets and took the rubbish away from our houses, we should get terrible diseases in our towns.</seg>
    <seg id="4">In fact, when we say that all of us must be educated to fit us for life, it means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Education is not an end but a means to an end. In other words we do not educate children only for the purpose of educating them.</seg>
    <seg id="6">When men become organized in to very large groups and civilization and develops.</seg>
    <seg id="7">It is possible to get freedom from hunger, thirsty, cold, heat and many diseases, so that each person can live a happier life than he could.</seg>
    <seg id="8">It means that we must be educated in such a way that, firstly, each of us can do whatever job is suited to his brain and ability, and secondly, that we can realize that all jobs are necessary to society and that is very bad to be ashamed of ones work or to scorn someone else'.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that in May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with a lot of care and Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reed was asked this question that China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan so he said in his answer that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that its evidence is also present that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan has used the Chinese model. Later the documents received from Libya also confirm this.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Another question that is it common to do nuclear experiments mutually. Then he said that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that we also predict that Israel also has access to the results of this experiment.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reeds was also asked if China is continuing nuclear proliferation?</seg>
    <seg id="15">On this Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and the design to a nuclear facility of Iran in its city Asfahan.</seg>

    <seg id="4">European Commission's Spokemen Amadeu Altafa said every effort is commendable  that can help a unified message from the European Union to reach the warring sides.</seg>
    <seg id="5">In light of the governments statement all seems to be fine.</seg>
    <seg id="6">But in reality the European Union is presenting a view of conflict amongst each other on this idea which is very sad.</seg>

    <seg id="10">Despite France has expired its 6 months Presidential term</seg>
    <seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play a leaders role and he can also do it but he lacks the authorization to do it.</seg>

    <seg id="13">he is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of Czech republic Schwarzenberg.</seg>
    <seg id="14">the problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the Middle East war.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. moreover Germany has sent its special ambassador to Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance, it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.</seg>
    <seg id="16">its proof is the Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.</seg>

    <seg id="2">Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany left a huge business group behind him.</seg>
    <seg id="3">but a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.</seg>
    <seg id="4">when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.</seg>
    <seg id="5">The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 to one Billion Euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle went into deep pressure.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had got to this position from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic powet.</seg>
    <seg id="8">After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quick, putting it on new lines.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm, Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm always had special importance.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.</seg>
    <seg id="14">After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have sanctioned 400 million Euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Therefore, after Adolf Merkeley's demise the Merkeley Group, which once existed, came to an end.</seg>

     <seg id="2">new research</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="3">exercise at any age is good for health.</seg>
    <seg id="4">it energizes your heart, reduces the cholesterol level, helps in keeping the weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer or dementia.</seg>
    <seg id="5">unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.</seg>
    <seg id="6">experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.</seg>
    <seg id="7">According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="12">In which the pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.</seg>
    <seg id="13">The experts focussed on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They learnt that as people grew old, there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says that as age increases, the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear, and this affects the ability to exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Garwin  Cain was also a part of this study.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this. And this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="18">Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.</seg>
    <seg id="19">If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart, they can achieve the benefits of excercise, despite the increase in age.</seg>
    <seg id="20">A detailed report of this has been published in the magazine of the American Medical Association.</seg>

     <seg id="1">There used to be one Muslim League (n), but they also made the rough version of the 18th amendment and handed it over to the Peoples Party.</seg>
     <seg id="2">Before that, MQM and Muslim League (q) had already handed in rough versions of the 18th amendment to the national assembly and senate.</seg>
     <seg id="3">It still seems that the copies of the 18th amendment is a political trickery, and no one is sincere about accepting that amendment.</seg>
     <seg id="4">This is why no fuss was made in the assembly or on the floor of senate over this amendment, and the parliament was not forced into accepting the amendment.</seg>
     <seg id="5">It looks as if the parties just wanted to get the thing off their backs by submitting the rough versions, so that tomorrow, they may say that we had submitted our versions of the amendment, but the government speaker did not take action.</seg>
     <seg id="6">MQM coalition partner of government, Muslim League N an underhand ally of government and Muslim league Q the party to approve the seventeenth amendment then how is it possible that these parties can be sincere to approve the disapprove amendment.</seg>
     <seg id="7">its just like writing your name amongst shaheeds by just putting color on yourself.</seg>
     <seg id="8">Peoples Party anyway is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment.</seg>
     <seg id="9">How would one think of getting his own hands cut.</seg>
     <seg id="10">as long as Zardari is the president, seventeenth amendment is not going to be cancelled.</seg>
     <seg id="11">this is an opinion of a majority in our survey and so is the truth.</seg>
     <seg id="12">if the seventeenth amendment was to be cancelled then Zardari would never had become the president.</seg>
     <seg id="13">Now he is even more powerful that president Musharaf as along with being the president he is also the chairman of the Peoples party.</seg>
     <seg id="14">as long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.</seg>
     <seg id="15">in order to cancel the seventeenth amendment, the political parties will first have to dismiss president Zardari from the presidency.</seg>
     <seg id="16">neither MQM wants this nor other parties.</seg>

     <seg id="1">most of the elders from our family belonged to the labor community.</seg>
     <seg id="2">in our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor work, we used to pray to Allah: that please save us from this hard labor work.</seg>
     <seg id="3">to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what should we do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor work.</seg>
     <seg id="4">the editor wrote in reply that we should select certain subjects and become doctors or engineers.</seg>
     <seg id="5">right from beginning my trend was towards engineering and I had selected technical drawing instead of Biology in metric as well.</seg>
     <seg id="6">but at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.</seg>
     <seg id="7">I studied Biology for hardly a month and then when nothing worked out, I took maths as an alternate subject.</seg>
     <seg id="8">means that the fear from labor work made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.</seg>
     <seg id="9">I remembered that when I along with my two sons were trying to remove the carpets from our old house.</seg>
     <seg id="10">It was only half an hour since he started working that the little boy said " Daddy, I am not born to do this"</seg>
     <seg id="11">I said that if this is true then study a lot like us and get rid of the physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="12">The son said, "I am studying and I will get through it also but it is the work that I can not do"</seg>
     <seg id="13">Whatsoever we did that work in three hours  and came back home.</seg>
     <seg id="14">The point of saying is that if a person picks his destiny, whatever is the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving that destiny.</seg>

     <seg id="1">It is said that do not say bad about the dead. But what shall we do, we see only bad things in Benazir even on her first death anniversary.</seg>
     <seg id="2">Benazir, for her selfish purpose, crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs after giving the list of their names who were fighting for freedom on one hand and on the other gave India the chance to keep its full attention on Kashmir after them helping to suppress Punjab Movement.</seg>
     <seg id="3">Tug of war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history, which has pushed the country back many years.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Benazir continued to give negative comments on Kashmir and the nuclear program after being exiled.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Baenazir went against the pact made with Nawaz Shareef in London by making a deal with General Musharaf</seg>
     <seg id="6">During the time of Baenazir's leadership she gave an open hand policy to her family members to earn money, and due to this he got to be known as Mr 10 Percent.</seg>
     <seg id="7">In the time of Baenazir her brother got murdered, and his murderers are still at large.</seg>
     <seg id="8">Besides being a woman Baebnazir did not fight for the rights of women.</seg>
     <seg id="9">The way in which Baenazir did politics on her fathers dead body, in the same way her followers are doing politics on the dead bodies of her family.</seg>
     <seg id="10">Baenazir got to be a leader twice and in that time punishing her fathers murders at one side she didn't even file charges against them.</seg>

     <seg id="2">and that he would soon be brought to account for removal from Governorship by the state congress, an American white friend of mine, who had deep insight into the situation in Pakistan, he told us, showing off, look this is called democracy.</seg>

     <seg id="4">and there is your country Pakistan whose president has been elected after dropping of corruption charges.</seg>

     <seg id="6">tell me when it happened in America?</seg>

     <seg id="1">in this picture, president Zardari is smiling despite of being surrounded by the Americans from all four sides.</seg>
     <seg id="2">it looks from his smile</seg>
     <seg id="3">He is thinking that America is supporting his government but he is forgetting that a year ago they were with Pervez Musharaf.</seg>
     <seg id="4">This picture was passed on, as if it was of some family.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Previously, such a photo was never printed in newspapers before, i.e. one president with three American agents.</seg>
     <seg id="6">It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.</seg>
     <seg id="7">It is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.</seg>
     <seg id="8">If it was a smart ruler, at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo, and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting.</seg>
     <seg id="9">If the rules of democracy are implemented on this photo, President Zardari is in minority.</seg>
