   </hl>
    <seg id="2">American scientists found this to be true from experimenting on mice.</seg>
    <seg id="3">Results proved that mice on a lower calorie diet had comparatively less ability to fight the flu virus.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Research disproved the old axiom, "It is better to fast during a fever".</seg>
    <seg id="5">According to scientists, one should eat during a fever.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Researchers at The Michigan State University said that mice, who were fed a lower calorie diet had less ability to fight flu symptoms than their counterparts who were eating a normal diet.  Studies also showed that their chances of death from the flu virus also increased.  Mice eating a normal diet had the strength to fight off the virus and live a longer life.</seg>
    <seg id="7">According to Professor Elizabeth Gardner, people who diet will not be affected with the flu sooner but they will require more time to recover from it.</seg>
    <seg id="8">She added that people who have received the flu vaccine should avoid dieting during the winter months.</seg>

     <seg id="1">'First Nuclear Experiment - 1990'</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">The books is authored by Americans Thomas Reed, a former weapon designer at the Lever National Laboratory, and Danny Stillman, the former director of technical intelligence at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</seg>
    <seg id="3">The book is titled 'Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation.' The authors claim that the first country to make a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets or had the support of another country.</seg>
    <seg id="4">in an interview with US news, Thomas Reed said that in 1990, during the rule of Benazir Bhutto, China texted Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reid said that, for many reasons, he believes that China had tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.</seg>
    <seg id="6">These reasons include the design of the bomb and information gleaned from talks with the Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He further added that China's assistance allowed Pakistan to, in only two weeks and three days, carry out nuclear testing in response to that of India in 1998.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reed recalled that, in 1961, Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear test. Although the U.S. had possessed the bomb for decades, it was 17 days before it conducted its own nuclear test in response.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He further said that the test of the nuclear weapon, which Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998, was made with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reeds was questioned as to whether China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he merely replied that India was a common enemy of both Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said there is proof that Doctor Abdul Qadeer Khan used Chinese design, and that documents acquired from Libia will confirm this statement.</seg>
    <seg id="12">He said that in 1990, the United States conducted nuclear tests in Nevada, and shared the results with Great Britain.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said that Israel was given access to the results of this test.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Thomas Reed was also questioned as to whether China is continuing with its nuclear testing program.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Thomas Reed said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions, and design to a nuclear facility in Isfahan, Iran, since 1990.</seg>
    <seg id="16">China also provided Iran a nuclear enrichment plant.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen through North Korea.</seg>

    <seg id="2">According to a new research, three cups of tea a day,</seg>
    <seg id="3">if taken, can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age, by more than a third.</seg>
    <seg id="4">In a research carried out by the Moffitt Cancer Institute, in the American state of Florida, it was revealed that the risk of occurrence of breast cancer tumors, in such women below the age of 50 years</seg>

    <seg id="7">Experts believe that the reason for this is that tea has such ingredients in it, which are more effective against specific tumors which generally occur in women below the age of 50.</seg>

    <seg id="12">Almost every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type of it.</seg>

    <seg id="3">Exercise is good at every age to remain healthy.</seg>
    <seg id="4">It makes your heart stronger, reduces cholesterol levels, helps control weight, helps in limiting diabetes and slows the Alzheimer's process.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Unfortunately, many people with increasing age have a reduced ability to exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Experts says with exercise our body and brain remains alert, yet aging can affect it.</seg>
    <seg id="7">According to American Medical Association, if exercise is excluded from daily life there can be many health problems that can develop in the future.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Patricia P. Leka of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says that an increase in age is a big reason for man's decrease in exercise and physical activity.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She headed research regarding heart disease and a man's ability to do exercise in older age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">A team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="12">They studied how the heart contracts and relaxes as it pumps blood.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is responsible for pumping blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They came to know that as age increases, problems increase in the relaxation action of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says with an increase in age, problems occur in the relaxation of heart and this effects the ability to exercise.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that they were surprised to see that it has an effect, as it confirmed that poor exercising ability is closely related to the heart's relaxation phase.</seg>
    <seg id="18">Some times blood pressure can cause disorders in the heart such as its functions and heart diseases.</seg>
    <seg id="19">If the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard, then they can take advantage of the benefits of exercise even with age.</seg>
    <seg id="20">A detailed report in this matter is published in a magazine of the American Medical Association.</seg>

    <seg id="8">When asked about the presence of terrorist factions, he said that the Indian army would face such groups who attempt to disturb the peace and are bent upon weakening India.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He said that in Kashmir, at least 700 to 800 militants are known to be present, of which approximately half are foreigners.</seg>

     <seg id="1">But there is something to be thought of-does noise affect our lives in some harmful ways?</seg>
     <seg id="2">already there is evidence that it does so in several ways. It has been recognized for a long time.</seg>
     <seg id="3">Now that exposure to noise high intensity leads to loss of hearing. There have been cases of boiler-makers, for example, who suffer from occupational deafness.</seg>
     <seg id="4">More recently it has also been found that people who are continuously exposed to other loud noises require protection of the ear.</seg>
     <seg id="5">If we live in industrial areas which are growing with every passing year, there are deafening noise produced by the speakers in house or shops, radio sets in the neighborhood, school children at play or at chorus practice of arithmetical tables, and so on.</seg>
     <seg id="6">MQM is a coalition with government, Muslim League(N) is secret partnership with government and Muslim League(Q) is the party that passed 17Th amendment, then how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17Th Amendment</seg>
     <seg id="7">This is the way to get ones name entered in the list of martyrs by just getting painted.</seg>
     <seg id="8">The Peoples Party is otherwise not in hurry to end the seventeenth amendment.</seg>
     <seg id="9">How any one can think of getting his own hands cut.</seg>
     <seg id="10">The seventeenth amendment cannot be abolished till Zardari is the President.</seg>
     <seg id="11">This was the opinion of majority in one of our survey and it is also correct.</seg>
     <seg id="12">Zardari would not have opted to be the President, if seventeenth amendment was to be abolished.</seg>
     <seg id="13">Now he is more powerful than President Musharraf, since along with President he is also  the chairman of Peoples Party.</seg>
     <seg id="14">The seventeenth amendment is there till he is the president.</seg>
     <seg id="15">Political Parties will have to remove President Zardari first, in order to abolish  the seventeenth amendment.</seg>
     <seg id="16">This is not the will of MQM or the other parties.</seg>

     <seg id="1">Most people in our family are of the laborer type.</seg>
     <seg id="2">During our childhood, when we used to see our uncles toil, we used to wish in our hearts that Allah would save us from labor that is hard on the body.</seg>
     <seg id="3">To save ourselves from this, we wrote a letter to the editor of the Amroz daily, asking him what we can do after metric to save ourselves from having to toil.</seg>
     <seg id="4">The editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and study Science and Math subjects.</seg>
     <seg id="5">My focus was always on engineering, and after metric, instead of Biology, I took Technical Drawing.</seg>
     <seg id="6">Upon entering the FSC, my elder brother forced me to study medicine and become a doctor.</seg>
     <seg id="7">I studied Biology for a month with great difficulty, but I could not understand the subject, so I took math as a subject instead.</seg>
     <seg id="8">So the scare of having to work made me an engineer, and today I am in a better condition compared to many of my relatives the same age, for which I am always thanking Allah.</seg>
     <seg id="9">I remembered this when I was trying to lift the carpet with my two young sons at our old house.</seg>
     <seg id="10">It was not half an hour since we started working, and the younger son said, "Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job."</seg>
     <seg id="11">We said, "If that is true, then study a lot like us, and free yourself from bodily pain."</seg>
     <seg id="12">The son said, "I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work."</seg>
     <seg id="13">The three of us finished that work in three hours and returned.</seg>
     <seg id="14">My purpose of saying this is that if a person has set a goal, whatever be the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving his goal.</seg>
     <seg id="15">But if you do not even know what you have to do, then Allah alone is your protector.</seg>

     <seg id="1">They say that you should not speak bad about the dead, but what can I do, even after one year of Benazir's death, I can only see faults in her.</seg>
     <seg id="2">For personal interests, Benazir handed over the list of Sikhs who were fighting for independence to India, at the same time crushing the Sikhs independence movement and also allowing India to transfer its complete attention to Pakistan, having taken care of the Punjab movement.</seg>
     <seg id="3">The Russia wars in the regimes of Benazir and Nawaz Sherif have become a part of history, which pushed the country many years back.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Benazir continued to speak ill about Kashmir and the atomic program throughout exile.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Benazir Bhutto struck a deal with Musharraf, this contradicts her London Treaty with Nawaz Sharif.</seg>
     <seg id="6">Benazir allowed her husband to openly earn money during her term in office, this is why he came to be known as Mr. Ten Percent.</seg>
     <seg id="7">In Benazir's term, her brother was killed and his killer has  yet to be punished for his crime.</seg>
     <seg id="8">Despite being a woman, Benazir did not fight for women's rights.</seg>
     <seg id="9">In a way similar to how Benazir did treated her father's corpse, her husband is now treating her corpse in the same manner.</seg>
     <seg id="10">Benazir came to power twice, but did not use resources at hand to bring those guilty for the political killing of her father to justice. She could not even file a case against them.</seg>

     <seg id="2">From his smile, I can tell</seg>
     <seg id="3">The America is with his government, but he is forgetting that last year the same people were with Parvez Musharaf.</seg>
     <seg id="4">This picture was passed on, as if it was from some family.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Previously, such a photo was never printed in newspapers before, i.e. one president with three American agents.</seg>
     <seg id="6">It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased. Now more than one agent was needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.</seg>
     <seg id="7">It is also possible that this was done because of the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.</seg>
     <seg id="8">If he was a smart ruler, at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo, and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting.</seg>

     <seg id="2">According to the government tactics so far, along with force, discussions have been ongoing.</seg>
     <seg id="3">But the use of force is not giving any benefit other than increasing the force of the Taliban, and increasing the public favor for them.</seg>

     <seg id="2">Whatever our expectations were, after he joined the 'War On Terror', he began to consider himself irremovable.</seg>
     <seg id="3">Then, whatever we expected of him was no more.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Just as Bush's rule began to come to an end, he started to worry about the end of his own rule, and he struck a deal with thieves in the dark.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Even then, General Musharraf could have commanded the army, but the present government does not even know what is happening.</seg>
     <seg id="6">Whether in Bajod or Swat, the army cannot control terror, and instead they bomb the 'enemy', i.e. the public. Apart from loss of life and money, if they are making the 'enemy' psychologically ill, then we are the enemies, aren't we?</seg>

     <seg id="1">Terrorism struck the Swat area in the Frontier Province and are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area.</seg>
     <seg id="2">On one side, the government's writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side, the effect of the Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everyday in Swat.</seg>
     <seg id="3">On the third side, the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.</seg>
     <seg id="4">The security forces claim the killing of many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but, in spite of these killings, the Taliban has not only gained strength but according to estimates, they have established their control over eighty-percent of Swat.</seg>
     <seg id="5">The result is that on the one hand, the government is not ready to accept its' defeat and on the other hand, the Taliban has established their hold.</seg>
     <seg id="6">In the end, who got the worst deal?: the poor citizens.</seg>
     <seg id="7">It is said that in Swat somebody asked, "what type of people are the Taliban?" The answer was, "very good people because they are the custodians of religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country."</seg>
     <seg id="8">Then the question was asked: how about the Army.  The answer was that the Army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.</seg>
