The role of European Union for the peace in Middle East
Officially European Union plays a decisive role in the mediatory efforts taken for stopping the war in Middle East.
According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of Sarkozy are helping hands in this process.
European Union spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said every single step which may help in delivering the conjoint message of European Union to fighting parties is appreciable.
Officially everything seems fine.
But in fact European Union is portraying a picture of internal tension, stress and strain.
The role of Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak
plus internal affairs has made her helpless.
On the other hand the course of action of French President Sarkozy depicts that France is still the President of European Union.
Although 6 months Presidency tenure of France is over.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role which he is capable of, but he isn't the authority.
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner is facing the funniest side.
He is in the delegation which is led by Schwarzenberg the Foreign Minister of Czech Republic.
In addition to that, the two foreign ministers are giving different statements on the war in Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend herself, while according to Kouchner war is not the defense. Germany has also sent a special ambassador to Middle East. As long as European Union does not show unanimous stand, she can not be successful on diplomatic front.
The prove is the no lift conduct of Israel to mediatory efforts of European Union.
This is the best time for European Union to prove herself, as America has failed in Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.
Financial crisis: German millionaire industrialist's suicide
Adolf Marclay, resident of Swabia in south Germany has left behind a huge industrialist group.
But he was not known to German public a while back.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks for weeks regarding his debts towards industrial groups, he became the hot news and could see the dark future for Marckay group.
Marclay Group had to bear the loss of hundreds of million euros after it bought the shares of one of known industry Folks Wigan.
then the financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed 100 Million and 1 billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on Marclay.
Recently the same banks accepted to provide loan to Marclay group on urgent basis but Adolf Marclay who started as a small industrialist to reach a place where his industrial group's annual income reached 30 billion euros, couldn't bear the the loss in his financial strength.
After the death of his father when Adolf Marclay took the responsibility of the business he used modern methods and made the business more successful.
He named his company Ratiopharm which is now Germany's most successful and biggest pharmaceutical company.
Till recent times this phamasutical company had a budget of around 5 to 6 billion euros and even now it is earning around 8 billion euros annually. After the great success of Rasue farm the Marclay Group bought many big industries like Hi-Del Barag Cement a manufacture of construction equipment. Kassbohrer and other good car maker
Marclay Group has a employee number of around 100 thousand around the world and among its industries, Rasue Farm has always been given special importance.
Adolf Marclay has said this many times in his life. ""We have been in pharma business since four generations"".
Now the industry is handled by the children and i hope that it continues to work for few hundred years by our family.
After the suicide of Adolf Marclay,the banks have given approval of temporary loan of 400 million euro for his group VEM but on this condition that VEM have to be sold to  Rasio Farm so that the financial position of this group is improved on long term basis.

9 percent has reduced to .21
4 percent.
According to Joachim Herrmann the Interior Minister of Bavaria it is only an apparent positive change.
He said: It must be considered that foreigners having the German citizenship are increasing.
So it must be added in the statistics that though the criminal is a German citizen but his background is foreigner.
Herrmann said that from 2010 his state will keep this fact in mind while collecting the data of criminals.
Other than Bavaria, Hemberg is also working on same pattern.
Senator Christoph Ahlhaus of Interior ministry from CDU said:"" When the scientific research is conducted one can not draw results of his own rather they depend on the data which is calculated after research.
Ahlhaus presented an analysis report of provincial office of crime management prepared in 2006, according to which in the Bergdorf area of Hemberg the percentage of foreigners in the crimes committed there was calculated.
Results indicate that here foreigners
crime rate is less then the crimes committed in the whole province.

7 percent.
Other political parties of Germany like SPD, clean atmospherics party Greens, and leftist party Linkspartei are against the of gathering information whether the background of a German citizen is foreign while collecting the data about crimes.

Tea: An effective treatment of Lung Cancer.
New research shows that drinking three cups of tea day
greatly reduces the risk of the lung cancer  in women under the age of 50.
This research from the Moffet Cancer Centre in Florida says that the chances of contracting lung cancer in women under the age of 50
who drink tea three times a day, are reduced by 37%
The research also said that having more than three cups of tea daily in women over the age of 50 has on special benefits.
Experts believe that the reason behind this is that tea has some elements that are effective against the formation of cancer cells in women mainly under the age of 50.
More than 5000 women who had lung cancer were treated in the Moffet Cancer Center, in Tampa, Florida.
They were aged between 29 to 74.
Researchers compared their medical records and lifestyles to women who were free of lung cancer.
Experts also discovered that tea was mainly effective on a certain type of cancer, called lopler, and was reduced by 66 %.
Every 10th patient of lung cancer falls under this type of cancer.
This type of cancer is especially dangerous because it is deeper than most, and is usually only discoverable when it has spread significantly.
Experts say that younger females can greatly reduce the risk of lung cancer by regularly drinking three cups of tea every day.
They say that incorporating tea in the daily life can greatly reduce the risk of any cancer.
In Britain, more than 40,000 women are diagnosed with lung cancer every year.

Why is there decrease in exercise with increase in age?
New Research.
Exercise is good for health in any age.
This makes your heart stronger, decreases cholesterol levels, helps in reducing weight, helps stop diabetes and decreases the chances of Alzheimer's.
Unfortunately, a lot of people tend to exercise less with age.
Experts say that exercises keeps our mind and body alert, and affects the real age of a person.
According to the American Medical Association, not getting enough exercise can lead to numerous health issues.
Dr. Patricia Paylekka of the Mew Clinic of Minnesota reports that with increase in age, exercise is a major factor in determining proper body functioning.
Dr Patricia teaches Medicine in Mew Clinic.
She has done extensive research on older age and the ability to exercise with increasing age.
A team of doctors used High Frequency rays to determine the functioning of the heart.
In which, the ability of the heart to pump blood, and it's ability to shrink and relax was researched.
Experts have concentrated mainly on the left side of the heart which is mainly responsible for the pumping of blood.
They discovered that with increase in age, the problems in the rate of heart relaxation also increase.
Dr. Patricia says that with increase in age, the problems in the heart relaxation rates increases and thus effects the ability to exercise with growing age.
Dr. Carwin Cain was also part of this research.
He says that it's surprising to see the permanent effects of improper exercise on the heart.
In some instances, blood pressure is a factor in heart anomalies and heart diseases.
If doctors and patients can work together when it comes to heart diseases, then they can enjoy the benefits of exercise even with older age.
There has been a detailed report about this in the American Medical Association Publication.

May God bring people's dialogue pleasantness and bring Barack as blessing to world
Well there is no hope but see what Pakistan-America relationship brings to us in the result of this change
Thats the Wish of martin the king human right activist, who wnated to make the world a peaceful place
Obama's (whose name has Hussein also), oath as a President of America on one hand is historical while on the other hand is a hard test too
not only for him but for all those people who has supported him heartily.
This will also be a test for white people majority as it is not easy for them to accept heartily the presidency of black on them.
Here in Southern Asia specially Muslims who have developed expectation from him must remember that he has been elected as President of America and Obama must remember that President of America is Practically the president of the whole world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have to have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, so this will be a win for people who love him.
What will be its effect on South Asia and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan.

Dear, whether it is Obama or some one else, the decision of the policy of the entire world is done by Jews lobby of  billionaires, influencing, powerful and effective people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts,the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is in front of everyone.
Even after the creation on Pakistan the governance of Swat was in the hands of its King who even had his own army and law.
With a help of an agreement they transferred the administration of Swat to the Pakistan government.
But it's disheartening to know that our government treated Swat like how a step mother would treat anothers child.
After the end of the governance of the King there were no more schools founded in Swat.
And neither was the areas development given any notice.
Currently the number of girls acquiring education is far less than in previous years.
Targeting of educational institutes is continued by local Talibans in NWFP Province of Pakistan.
Most schools are destroyed in Swat majority of those are of girls.
Not only this Taliban has announced a ban on girls education.
Thousands of students (boys and girls) are unable to get education.
What do you think Talibans wants to achieve by stopping women education.
Why the government has failed to stop these illegal actions?
In your opinion what government should do.
Question must be this that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
Because Swat people has understand the game that army is there to serve Taliban not to kill them otherwise how five schools can be destroyed in a single night during curfew, how people can be butchered and hanged in the square.
When government writ is unable to implement in Swat in these circumstances how the government will succeed in eliminating these illegal activities.
Now the question is when government has every thing like armed force, latest weapons, latest technology and spy system then why these Taliban can;t be controlled?
The only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught.
The essence is that these Taliban are paving the path for 'International Imperialism' by their bad deeds.
fifteen years before the war was continued in Afghanistan.
ISI is controlling Taliban when at that time opponent was north coalition who was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly situation changed, actions of Taliban began to appear.
And ISI was also offered Dollars from America so past friends became enemies.
Now situation is this that war continues but helping in Pakistan are still those Iran, India and Russia.
Unless this feeling does not emerge in Human that what is right and wrong till then Human will keep doing mistakes.
As an example a thief when goes to steal if he at that time gets this thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse, there is also punishment in it and he fears from God then that Human will not steal.
Same like this that unless Israel do not gets this apprehension that i am doing wrong and draining blood of innocents and i will get punishment for this, he will keep playing Holi with the blood innocents of Gaza till then.
Greetings!
The question is whether war, armed movements and   terrorism are the answer to our problems?
If not then what is that chemical prescription that   will take us to the solution of these problems?
This extremist path of war does not solve our problems  but increases them.
In their movements, Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq should  take the path that Nelson Mandela took in South Africa  as a model.
That means political and inner struggle are more   important than armed struggle.
From the participation of Kashmiris in elections it   can seen that they have accepted this point-of-view.
The Israeli  attacks on Gaza still continue in the third week and the death toll have reached to one thousand.
In spite of international diplomatic efforts ,yet it did not reach to cease-fire.
According to an estimate,since the attacks started on 27 December to uptill now,90 thousand Palestinian left their homes and have been migrated to the safe areas.
On the other hand relief organizations said by accusing Israel of dereliction of duty toward the protection of Palestinian children ,that the one entire generation of Palestinian children has become victim of serious psychological and emotional difficulties.
what do you say?
What should be done?

Talibans should be given chances.
Basit,Peshawar
Be aware if taliban started the real jehad then who will slaughter the innocent people?
Who will put girl's school on torch?
And who will hang people at poles by nominating as American spy having no ransom from them after kidnapping.
No nation or religion has dammaged Islam so far then these talibans.
Persian era.
Kohat Pakistan
If the whole Islamic world just threat Israel for launch of attack you will see that in how much pain father of Israel America will be in
and not only talks about real ceasefire rather ceasefire will be accomplished.
But what to do our Muslim leaders lack the courage greatly.
Some one ask Ahmadinejad to take the initiative because your bravery is very popular in BBC Forum.
The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights does not rest with the Arabs or the Muslims of the world alone but is the obligation of the entire world community to raise their voice against tyranny.
This dreadful incident is the worst amongst the crimes committed by Bush.
Just like in Pakistan and India at the end of the financial year on 30th of June, the governmental institutions are pillaged; the American establishment before the expiry of its term gave a green signal to Israel to do whatever she wants.
On the one hand, America says that a ceasefire will be attempted.
On the other hand, the United Nations is accepting petitions and more petitions, but in reality it's nothing. This means only one thing, that even the United Nations is in on the conspiracy against muslims.
All Muslim nations should disregard the United Nations, and unite under their own weight.
We have a lot of examples in front of us. Where America and United Nations are only passing petitions, the Muslims are bearing the brunt of it.
What is the use of this probaganda when BBC is not going to publish it.
Now where are all the journalism principles. When it comes to muslims blood BBC seems to take its eyes off the reality.
By the way self proclaimed leader of rights.
Pubslishing something from their own sounds far, they even din't publish the discussions.
On be half of the muslims
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, and the likes of you stay among Muslims, call yourselves Muslims and cause Muslims..
[syja786]
For a long time on BBC forums, sometimes suicide bombing and other times terrorism in India was used to target a certain sect.
The favorite word of these Anti-Islamic discussions was Extremism.
You can get a very good idea, about who an extremist is, from the above discussion in which, writing against Iran was almost considered blasphemy.
When will our muslims understand that Anti Christ can not be fought with swords.
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what shall one do other than crying?
But the basic fault is of this turmoil and massacre which by naming Jihad, we try to blacken the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of Palestinians accepted the existence of Israel then why did Hammas need to fire those rockets on Israel and made suicide attacks?
Attitude of the both the sides is against humanity.
The role of UN and the USA was again seen as favoring towards the injustice of Israel.
May Allah give muslim nation the understanding of becoming  united. Ameen!
and the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism, after all they are doing the real work.
otherwise, is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are.
so in this situation, in common terms it is called DADAGEERI which means do what ever you can.
That it even hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry.
Although medicines for the wounded, shrouds and compensation money for the dead are being provided by the Arab Rulers but it is being asked.
What should be done about Israeli attacks?
The problem is that the heads of state of all the muslim countries including Saudi Arabia are in a deep slumber. Neither do they have an army nor any defensive strategy. All they think of is that by giving aid, they have fulfilled their obligation.
They should immediately take practical steps against Israeli aggression.
Like placing an embargo on the oil to European countries and America but alas they ......
Greetings to all brothers and sisters!
In my opinion, telling Hamas to quit in the name of peace now, would be an injustice to thousands of widows and orphans.
If the Israelites and their supporters are at a rise, then soon Moses shall be born, as this is the law of nature. America and Israel work as gunpowder amongst suicide bombers in Muslims.
The power drunk elephants do not understand this.
Abu Abdulla: Pakistan.
Hamas and Israel should reconcile so that this bloodshed comes to an end.
Muhammad Sarfraz, Paris, France
Absolutely true.
Let’s suppose that Hamas is really the righteous one and they have waged Jihad against the tyranny to become successful in the divine court, even then they should at least realize that if good brings harm to the people then it is of no use
Those who claim to love God, his Messenger, and their religion; it becomes an integral part of their faith to love humanity.
So after muslims, all believers who are living on this earth should be wiped out according to the command of Allah?
Najeeb-ur-Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI$T@N]
No, not to be wiped out but the command is to convey to them the message of Islam.
But Jihad should be waged against those who conspire against the religion.
They will be fought against until they abandon their nefarious plans but this doesn’t mean that a suicide bomber, wearing a jacket, should blast himself in a gathering.
Brothers, the fate of the murderer of innocent children is annihilation.
But my request to my friends is that Israelis, who had no refuge until yesterday, are now so powerful today that they don't pay heed to what the world says because the Jews are one.
They are not divided into Shiites and Sunnis but they are all Jews and have made progress in every field of life, built everything.
On the contrary, what is the condition of the 55 Islamic states?
They are lagging behind in every field and now they are so helpless that they are at the mercy of their enemy and are just waiting for their death.
Point required is that all Muslim countries should get together and should make a plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better course of action than accepting Israel. Learn new technology and ways of success from them and let the world live in peace.
Muslims have great land and resources.
The need is correct usage.
First of all, the most tragic part is that Hammas and Alfatah could not be united.
The only reason to destroy great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin was to weaken the only nation fighting for Aqsa Mosque. And it was impossible until Yasir and Yasin were removed from the way.
The world is watching that how Palestine was falling down every second after the death of these two leaders.
And  how this lobby of jews strengthened their target by every moment.
In 1974 a Pakistani Prime Minister was of such an International trust that first time in history he united all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance.
Today on his 81st birthday is it hard enough for the nation to promise for unity with each other
but by eliminating the differences between other Muslims will accomplish its (establishment of Islamic Common Wealth) incomplete mission.
This is the Jin which has grabbed the Palestine by half a century.
This Jin has many mouths.
Many times this Jin converts the attention and pressure of the World by calling bad names to himeself from his own or from any other mouth.
And other mouth of this Jin is eating humen beings in Iraq,Afghanistan,Iran and in Pakistan.
And this Jin is the most anoid with Islam than any other,because it knows that whenever it had turned out,it would have been only and only by Islam, Muslims, and complete faith of Muslims and by practical Islam.The history tells that Islam has taken many people like Abu- Jehal on the right path.
bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since 27th of December.
more that 3 hundred Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
after the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
however the Israeli authorities say that they will continue operation in Gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
in your opinion, is this claim of Israel true that it's doing all this for defending the sovereignty of Israel?
is the world community playing its role in such situation?
does this aggression has an indirect relation with the coming elections in Israel?
can any improvement be expected in the situation in Middle East after the succession of the newly elected American president Barak Obama.

Though BBC news are often true but the real thing is the delivery.
What to highlight and which news is given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
Now In this regard our Pakistani print and electronic media, specially few Urdu newspapers and columnists etc. are not behind in the trade who in the coverage or writing of increasing terrorism exaggerate to hell.
At one side the United Nations, which apparently talks about human rights and peace, Muslims are wronged and tortured to their limits , but the United Nations only condemn Hammas attacks. For how long will they continue to have this two faced policies
Why are the Muslims tortured that much, if the American people stop favouring Jews then as God said that they would live worst lives, so Americans, u stop favouring them and then see their fate
All these world renowned leaders and people who murder innocents in the name of peace should realize that peace in the world can only be achieved by justice, and not through injustice or wiping entire races.
If killing a particular race off completely is the answer, then Hitler's plan would not have seen any jews survive, and definitely not seen their rise.
Says a poet
Injustice is injustice. If it breeds, it dies.
Blood is blood. If it bleeds, it dries.
How can anyone define terrorism?
Isn't all this terrorism too? Why does only ones pain seem painful?
Aren't other people human too? So why is only Muslim blood so important? Wasn't all the innocent people's blood red too?
So why are there no disapproval messages now?
I watched the Mumbai attacks investigations like the fire was in my own home. I cannot watch this human suffering. Can't everyone else see this suffering? I wish Muslims all over could come together and think about this.
Dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood, how shall we condemn, I can not find words!
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims that on one side people are being killed in India so the rest of the world comes over Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations otherwise we will do it ourselves!
And on the other side, Israel is killing generations of muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent. This is unbearable!
There is delay but not NEVER in the house of God and only then will this darkness shed. Then
The threat to Israeli sovereignty is a joke as long as it has America's backing.
As far as elections are concerned, it is not surprising that the people who are in power do such things to win the heart and mind of people especially in a state like Israel. And speaking of Barak Obama, history shows that no American president has wavered from the policy and will not do so in future. A tyrant is a tyrant whether he is white or black.
It appears from the conversation of forum that everyone is grieved over Benazir death but as politician her mistakes are not forgotten.
It is debatable that Benazir died for democracy or for power.
If she sacrificed for democracy then why she left democracy in the dictatorship of Musharraf for 10 years till she got a deal and American clearance?
Benazir did not return Pakistan when dictatorship affected people needed her she returned Pakistan when she has the assurances of free from cases and of power.
No one is going to say anything about the way that this historical figure is being falsely accused.
Sana Khan.
Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them.
One more writer.
Sir/Madam, maybe if you read not only the history of Pakistan, but of it's neighboring four countries, or of seven other countries, then you might understand the meaning of Mr. Psycho.
Tariq Abbas
One whose nature is wrong cannot be taught.
For reflection in water is not always clear.
Britain never let them become one, and invented the hindu-muslim friction which was taken ahead by sir Syed.
Psycho.
So relentless is our nation, that they are blind when writing poetry for their parties, but no one says anything when our historical figures are battered and falsely accused.
We have progressed enough.
Sana Khan.
Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey doesn't become a scholar if you put books on him.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks but Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.
If they talk about war then both the sides will suffer human loss.
India says that Pakistani citizen is caught in Bombay attacks. And he has written and sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. But earlier, when India caught this extremist, said that he is a smart engineer but later they declared him to have studied only four grades. This is what has to be considered.
First of all, merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and  all christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
We want flowers of peace rather in the flame of war.
War is itself a problem.
What solution will the war give?
Today will give Fire and blood.
Tomorrow will give hunger and necessity.
For this wise people
it is better that war keeps postponing.
In your and our garden
it is better that candle keeps lit.
The relations between India and America are now deep rooted and India certainly wishes that if the time comes, America shall betray Pakistan blatantly.
This is also the history of America.
Though in case of an attack by India, America will achieve her goals and the expenditure will all be that of India.
Pakistan should clearly state that they will not take the initiative but if any aggression is waged, then the talk of peace and ceasefire will only take place either after India’s complete destruction or its capture, even if this happens at the cost of their lives.
This is exactly what Islamic history is.
Before this resolution Pakistani people and army has delivered their message.
Indian struggle for having unusual diplomatic and military benefits in compensation of Mumbai attacks are proving her cunning party then affected. Therefore the world has reduced its pressure on Pakistan contrasting to its initial hard reaction.
UN has expressed faith on Pakistani efforts ignoring the unnecessary lamentation of India and Interpol's appreciation of Pakistani efforts is the 'side effect' of unwanted Indian diplomacy.
there are no two opinions over this that it is a heinous act.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past one year?
Every day, how many Taliban die due to the firing of the thousands of mortar and canon shells they fire?
I appeal to the ICI that they stop their guardianship of the Taliban, for Gods sake, and let us live peacefully in paradise like Swat.
And they stop this fixed operation.
The day is not far when in UN resolution of Army intrusion in Pakistan will be approved just like the one against Jamat Aldawa.
Riaz Ahmed Farooqi
First our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in UN,
and suppose if this resolution took time to approve then considering the example of America any country will launch the attack at her own.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
As the bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are immortal even after they die.
But there is a international game being played here in which place public is ruled by frightening through barbarism and ferociousness.
So that license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will clutch the government.
These acts of so called Islamic activists on the name of religion is without limit worthy of condemnation.
These supporters of extremists can see the injustice of America but instead of expressing grieve on those dishonest acts they clearly shun them by giving them name of tribal traditions.
Sometimes by cloaking in tribal traditions, sometimes on the name of Islam, any pious man cannot give reason for such dishonest acts.
In my view, our Army people are associated with theses people.
As such that when these people move from a place then it takes such time that they can be caught, there should be time for that but its a stretch that they get there on time even if they are there, they are long gone.
Are they so merciless that they kidnap fifty seventy men and our Army putting hand on hand looks at them like a spectator.
They are servant of Allah and  so is Army.
It is very clear that there is fishy.
instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and lesson gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell,
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Who burnt the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on the refusal of oath after the Prophet (PBUH) passed away and how took her husband by the rope in his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
without accepting reality neither the motives can be diminished nor correction can be made.
O' BBC please stop this dual-headed policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
please show some modesty, a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office.
For the success of Operation Sherdil and across the border the success of Operation Lion Heart depends on the favor of people.
It is carried out by American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahib is a victim of conspiracy.
In this forum all reviews will be against Taliban, Agencies have been successfully indulged in Taliban and are applying the policies which might change public opinion.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public. They even report something like this 'Bombing on Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000, in Swat went there to do.
That the bodies of the Taliban who helps the army is left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake stop this drama.
These Taliban's have spoilt the name of Muslims
Through out the world if Muslims don't tell them Muslims then why would terrorists are found in their territories.
those who become insensitive and people who don't want to work hard take guns and join these groups
Islam has not spread from guns and swords.
be ashamed
Its need is neither in any religion nor in any customs.
All media including BBC gives thier views about taliban and tribal areas by different resources
But nobody knows what the actual situation is. It is we who know about it because we are tribals.
In short this is a game in which CIA, RAW, MUSAD, and our own ISI is involved.There is nothing like taliban or tribal people, they are the negative elements created by these institutions who are spoiling the name of Islam, Taliban, Religous institutes, Pukhtoon nation and Tribals.
Because of this act, head of the Muslims petulance of shame .
I salute  to M.Q.M leader Iltaf Hussein,A.N.P and to the division of the P.P.P for raising their voices against this cancer,named Taliban.
This cancer is creation of Zia-ul-haq,who is gone but he has also destroyed the Pakistan.
But i am hopefull that the present Government will abolish this Cancer.
After Mumbai attacks India said that few extremist groups are involved in these attacks.
Pakistan denied these blames and said that she will fully cooperate in the investigation.
India said that she has provided Pakistan a list of 20 extremists, who are wanted to India.
Noe Pakistan said that leader of Jaish e Muhammad Maulana Masud Azhar present in this list is not detained and Government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before this President Asif Ali Zardari has denied the impression that Western Secret Agencies and Indian Government have provided Pakistan the proves of Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said about Ajmal Qasab that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
During this Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that Indian relation with her can't get better till the time her soil is used for terrorism.
And in recent updates Indian Cricket team has canceled its tour of Pakistan.
Should these political incidents affect sports?
How do you see the future of Pakistan and India relations?
Pakistan will not be torn apart by America or India.
It will be torn apart by Pakistani themselves.
What can you expect after so much internal segregation and rivalry?
However, Jinnah didn't do well with the Muslims from India, and time has already proven that.
Yasmin: Chicago.
Madam, if Jinnah's work was carried forward, then these internal cancer of segregation and rivalry would not have spread, and the muslims in India wouldn't be in the situation they are in now.
It's our fault that after him, no other leader could stand in his shoes.
But if we can't appreciate our heroes, then....
This sector does have a lot of abilities.
God knows when they will come to their senses and use the blessing of unity to make some progress.
Both countries have priests, Shiv sena, RSS etc. that constantly oppose peace.
And these negative forces do not want the sector to make any progress, hence the countries are kept on their toes.
Can you imagine the status of this place in the world for Pakistan, India and China, with just a little bit of unity?
Pakistan is cursed by God for having robbers and thieves as their appointed leaders.
May God  our country Pakistan always be safed, ameen.
But,please open your eyes to look at  the situation and ground realities around you then  you will come to know that where American  troops have reached .
Besides the country matters do not seems better.The circumstances in NWFP, Baluchistan,and the situation of Karachi in Sindh, are also in front of you .
In this situation the country needs that leader who can make us a united nation.
May God mercy upon us.
I think a last war is the only option.
That's it, enough is enough.
This situation is ""now or never"".
These false acts of cooperation will not solve the problem.
Nor will small terrorist attacks in each others countries.
Afterall, even Europe was founded after the last world war.
And if there had not been a great war, then they would still be fighting back and forth like Pakistan and India.
Almost all of our political parties are agreed on the fact that terrorism and sectarianism should be rooted out of the country.
But our military leadership does not seem sincere in this regard. On one hand they assure America and Europe that they are with them in this war against terror and on the other hand are covertly aiding the Taliban.
We should now ponder and set our direction and choose one path only. Thanks
There is no doubt that the majority of the movement league are from the Tayaba Group, who joined the league after the inception of Pakistan.
However, after that,  this leagues obstructed aid campaigns, and now on India's insistence, United Nations has declared them as the enemy and even the Government of Pakistan is cracking down on them.
In my opinion, if these Jihadi groups quit this religious fanaticism, and try helping instead, then it would be better for all.
The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan are employing professional criminals in the name of Jihad, the mentors of these and the mullahs are the same people who called Pakistan, Paleedistan and what not from time to time.
They are not letting any stone unturned in the destruction of Pakistan.
They do not deserve to be called humans let alone muslims.
Without rooting these miscreants out of Pakistan, the national security will be at risk.
Is there still room for consideration whether these scoundrels should be banned?
There is no place in this world for extremist mullahs whose only purpose is to kill.
Heart is breaking into pieces on this news.
What world is this where it is hard to survive for the one who names an important part of Allah's religion Islam.
Non Muslims can kill Muslim, but if Muslim even tries to take revenge then along with the whole non Muslim world our hypocrite leaders also treat the ones sincere with true and sincere religion like they are treating our great leader Hafiz Saeed now a days.
As a penalty of Mumbai attacks India.
Pakistan relations are affected, and the recent improvement of relations between two countries is enormously shocked.
India has been continually blaming active armed and unarmed groups in Pakistan
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the action against these groups.
Whereas Indian Security agencies has directly blamed Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks
, in this regard Jamat Adawa has also been nominated.
It is not the first time that because of any terrorist attack the relation of these two countries are worsen.
In December 2000 after the attacks on Indian Parliament both countries were at the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashkr e Taiba was banned and was included in terrorists list.
Now Jamat Adawa, to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of Lashkr e Taiba, is demanded to be banned.
What do you think, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against active extremist groups on her soil?
Can by banning Jamat Adawa present India,
Pakistan crisis will vanish and to what extent it is vital to ban armed groups for establishing forever peace between the two countries.
Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly?
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful state.
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salam- Please do it with pleasure but act at your own.
do not do it under American pressure.
if India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
And why it accuses us of every thing?
there are extremist groups and organizations in India as well, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the world?
What India is doing in Kashmir, what is that?
What Israel is doing, what is that?
the truth is; we are the first Nuclear Muslim State and why; this is the main issue.
Pakistan is now in it's last stages.
Kamran Hassan: Abu Dhabi
Your words touch the heart, and the situation seems so.
Now in American publications, the new map of Pakistan is being printed, and all these restrictions are now apparent in the series of events.
The Americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over Pakistan.
In this situation, if we do not stand together and show our unity, then remember, if Bangladesh can be made, then anything can happen.
Terrorist attacks should be condemned to the maximum, whether they are on the Mumbai Hotel or the Marriot Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine.
Similarly, terrorists should be hunted down irrespective of their nationality and whether they are Pakistani, Indian, American or Israeli.
Now the question is that every day terrorist attacks take place in Pakistan, hundreds of people die but the Pakistani officials along with the rest of the world stay silent.
Wasn’t the attack on the Marriot Hotel an act of terrorism?
Then why...?
Appreciation for Interior Advisor Rehman Malik, Masha Allah he has become very brave!
According to BBC on one hand (a committee of) Security Council of UN has banned Jamat Aldawa, on the other hand Mr. Malik says we didn't impose the ban and if it is to be done will be after through research.
Not this, according to BBC Mr.Malik has strongly denied the impression that arrest of terrorists are taking place because of 'someone's instructions'
Highly appreciated!
whether having the ability or not or to say that I don't want.
We, the Pakistanis are fighting whose war.
and why we have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect.
No one has  a right to interfere anyone's national affairs.
The colonial system is apparently not there.
If people expect justice, or demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan, which I think is not acceptable by those calling for unity.
Pakistan is always following European and American purposes.
This goes on without the approval of many of its citizens.
And it invokes hostile sentiments.
If you believe in the United States of America, then why not just give up your place and leave honorably?
Pakistan has the ability to be armed or unarmed.
Security forces raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
Pressure is being increased on Pakistan for taking rapid action against extremist organizations after Mumbai attacks.
India blames Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Secretary Condolisa Rice asked Pakistani leadership to take practical measures for instant and transparent action against the responsible s of Mumbai attacks.
She says that no doubt the extremists responsible for Mumbai attacks used Pakistani soil.
During this Peshawar Government says that unknown armed persons has set another truck stand for supply of goods to Allied Forces deployed in Afghanistan on fire, due to which more then fifty vehicles are destroyed.
It is the second attack on Neto and American supplies during 48 hours in Peshawar.
During this Pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from Karachi to Tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action.
It is revealed that during the reign of General Zia ul Huq because of the invasion of the ex USSR in Afghanistan and its resistance started by the American and Saudi funding resulted in the birth of armed groups of which Pakistan unable to terminated could not get back herself to the era before 1980s.
The question is does Pakistan want to do it?
Is Pakistan capable of doing this?
What do you think?

I have only one question from all humanitarian leaders.
You murder their children and they bring garlands for you?   That's impossible

knowledge of east and west is there any logic, reason or philosophy which allows killing of innocent people including Namazi, laborers and poor service men in the revenge of American attacks
If your answer is no then you need to correct your point of view.
Peoples were armed at that time it was feared that after Afghanistan, Russia will attack Pakistan so people were armed.
Now when there is the danger of American attack via Afghanistan of which current American President clearly expressed in his presidential campaign then why should we disarm these people?
Only for this that after defeating Pakistani Army America or India may not face any public resistance?
Yes, if any of them is involved in sabotage activities then only Pakistan should take action against him.
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
And another question is that were these terrorists not supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As for as Lashkr e Taiba is concerned ongoing terrorism is not linked to it.
It must be recalled that Hafiz Saeed was the first 'Militant Leader' who declared activities of Taliban 'revolt'.
I am quite sure that Taliban agitation is a vital part of American plans so every person or organization must be eliminated who challenges Taliban in any aspect.
Despite the cooperation of the whole nation action against Lashkr due to the pressure of India indicates the nervousness and flatterness of Zardari and Co.
To terminate the expedition started by the American and Saudi funding, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society.
Also protest them that by what ethics American and Saudis are spreaded dangerous arms and so called Jihadi but in fact the virus of  loathsome literature and culture, due to which human butcher houses established in our country.
After the threat of an attack from the Indian side, an announcement from the Pakistan Army that they would pull their troops from the Afghan Border and would commit them towards India and a declaration from Taliban that they would take care of the Afghan Border, staggered the Americans badly and thus put all their weight behind Pakistan against an Indian attack.
This exposed the might of the American Army in the region.
Although India neither made any threat of an attack nor she had the courage to do so.
In addition, attacks of Taliban on the American supply lines proved to be the final nail in the coffin.
Thus, it was proved that without the help of Pakistan Government and Army, America would achieve nothing.
Karachi Business Financial Center of Pakistan is Dubai of underdeveloped areas.
Hundreds of thousand never return empty pocket from here, but since the grip of law has weekend in Western Frontier areas all eyes are on Karachi.
Now they are about to kidnap this city.
First time Pathans are named Pakhtoon, residents of a city are involved in fighting like strangers, although need of the time is unity.
One solution of the problem is that the Urdu speaking people learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu or if everyone learns English, the better.
You will certainly think of the suggestion as absurd, but don’t you think the cause of the conflict is bizarre?
That the cause of clash is language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, during my childhood, I really gave this suggestion on numerous occasions to my friends of all ethnic and religious groups; every time people laughed at it.
At that time, these ethnic and religious sentiments of hatred were not so strong, they were merely boiling inside.
Can't understand what and why it is happening?
Are these the indicators of Dooms day.
By what reason innocents are dieing?
Every one knows the causes those who want to destroy Pakistan are involved and those who commit all this have no religion or country.
Either Karachi or Mumbai it is an inside job.
Every upcoming government gets herself involved in changing the names of places, like now a days airport, roads, buildings all Benazir.
Is this the meaning of Benazir which is happening in Karachi and to the peoples of Pakistan?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awaken sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
Where reaction full of patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties have taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time they have also given American planners one more chance to think.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the worse situation in Karachi and administration is not neutral.
Administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately
, police and rangers don't take action because of political parties pressure.
To unite is only expressed in speeches, political parties should have to quit their interests and work for common people.
Till the end administration is under political pressure such incidents will increase, Allah bless Pakistan.
In my openion,these are the biggest terrorrists.
And there must be some foreign hands behind it but do'nt  know which?
But if these circumstances occured in any city of N.W.F.P,then govt. had to do anything against it using all of it's resources but the govt. seems to be helpless when this is not in N.W.F.P.
Govt. should take an army action here saving a big and important city of the country from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will have to face an enormous financial crisis.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth being scared. On the other hand Pakistan's media's condition is even worse.
The complete truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is this that Urdu speaking people should learn Pashto or Pashto speaking people should learn Urdu or it is even better if everyone learns English.
You will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but don't you think the reason for collision is ridiculous?
that language is the reason of violence?
At last another merciless incident in Karachi that was terrifiying every citizen for long.
The media reports are only 50 percent of last four incidents occured there.One did't left any space according to his chances.
Last three nights were sleepless and are still afraid.
To kill the cobblers and dry fruit sellers who tried to emptify the hotels.
They who cut the ears of innocent people and rob at the super highway,are all ignorent of Allah's approach,to whom they will be a victim of one day.
In your opinion, what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
Placing in front of us the heart struck attacks of Bombay, we certainly do not have to dive to find the reasons for this disturbance in Karachi. But there is one simple and easy reason that this disturbance was the result of spilling of blood subconsciously.
It is evident that if some one will knock kneed with the father, it is not unusual for the son to get out of control.
Liaqat Ali Khan and many devotees also belonged to there,for correcting the misunderstanding of Mr. Psycho I am quoting a verse
We also will follow our ancestors
sacrificed for her existence and will sacrifice to save her.
Faizan Taufiq Siddiqui
It is very sad, the whole country is at stake while we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui for your kind information if Wikipedia.
org is searched for Liaqat Ali Khan, you will know that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family of an area of Punjab Karnal.
Due to his services for Muhajirs, they consider him their leader.
Every action has got a reaction.
Till our own is bearable but.
Ijaz Awan
Before that you gather a crowd of people giving suggestions over the night,I have to tell you that we can find true evidences of real missbehaving in the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalkings and posters.
We have been bearing both kinds of misbehaviour.
By the way,vegabonds even did not tolerated newly existed Pakistan and its founder.But they have never faced any reaction.
In return,creating problems for the same country,Pakistan
Only Muslim League (N) was left, she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to Peoples Party.
Before this MQM and Muslim League (Q) has already submitted the draft of 18th amendment in assembly and senate.
Till now it appears that 18th amendment was a political move and none of the party is sincere in its approval.
This is why nobody has raised voice in the favor of this amendment in senate or assembly and neither forced the House to approve the amendment.
It seems that by submitted the draft of 18th amendment these parties has beaten around the bushes means they can claim that we had submitted the amendment but the ruling party's speaker did not proceed.
MQM an ally of government, Muslim League (N) secret friend and Muslim League (Q) has approved the 17th amendment, then how is it possible that they are sincere in removing 17th amendment.
It is like painting red to be counted amongst martyred.
Peoples Party is not what so ever in a hurry to remove 17th amendment.
Nobody can think of cutting his own hands.
As long Zardari is President 17th amendment will be there.
It was majority's opinion in our one survey and a fact too.
If 17th amendment ought to be removed then Zardari wont become president.
Now he is more powerful then President Pervez as along with the President he is the Chairman of Peoples Party.
Till he is president 17th amendment is there.
For removing 17th amendment political parties has to depart President Zardari from President house first.
Neither MQM wants it nor the other parties.
Most elders of our family belonged to labor class.
And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.
To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.
Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.
From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.
But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.
We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.
It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God
This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.
It was not even 30 minutes for us working that our younger son said “Dad it feels like I am not born for this job.
We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.
Son started saying that I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work .
Three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home.
What it means is that when a man decides the destination no matter what were the motives behind this no one can stop him from getting it.
But if you don’t even know what you have to do then God be with you.
It is said that don't accuse the dead, but can't help it as we see only evils in her on the first anniversary of Benazir.
On one side Benazir crushed independence movement of Sikhs by handing over the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India for her own sake and on the other hand provided India an opportunity to fully concentrate in Kashmir after crushing the movement in Punjab.
The greed of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years.
During her exile Benazir continued to give negative statements on Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir made a deal with Pervez Musharraf while betraying the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif.
During her reign Benazir provided her husband the opportunity of making money and because of this he popularized as Mr. 10 percent.
Benazir brother was killed during her reign whose assassins are still safe.
Though a woman still Benazir avoided to fight for the rights of women.
Just like Benazir politicized her father's dead body similarly his widower husband politicizing her dead body.
Benazir reigned twice but not only she failed to punish her father's political murder but could not file a case against them.
It has been thirty seven years since the separation  of East Pakistan and look at the height of   insensitivity of our people and rulers that neither   did anyone mourn nor grieved over their mistakes on   that day.
It should have happened that we should look upon 16th   December as a black day and should take appropraite   steps so that this type of accident does not happen   again.
On that day, we send humanism messages to the people  of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to us.
Rulers open the file of Mehmood-ul-Rehman Commission  in order to study the reasons for the separation of  East Pakistan.
They are making strategies to bring back the Beharis   (ethnic class) stranded in Bangladesh and send them  gifts to encourage them.
But we have become so indifferent that when someone  dies in our own neighborhood we don't  know about it.
We are not even concerned about our brothers because  we have become too self-centered.
Even after big tragedies we return to our routine  life the next day.
Perhaps, like East and West Germany were united, in   the same way, East and West Pakistan will also be  united once more.
We can still be united if we are prepared to make   sacrifices for each other and come out of the crust   of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be fulfilled in the   near future
Today when it was told in the news that Governor of American State Illinois has been arrested for charges of corruption
and to remove him from governorship provincial Congress is preparing for his rapid accountability, our American friend who has a keen interest in Pakistani affairs exaggeratedly said to me 'see this is democracy'.
No one is beyond the law in America.
and here is your country Pakistan whose president was dropped of the corruption charges before sworn in.
My sense of humor rouse and I said what's strange if a governor has been arrested in America, in our Pakistan prime minister was arrested overnight and once was hanged and second time was exiled.
Tell me, has it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan the country law breaker has been departed from President House with guard of honor, tell me has it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan Chief Justice has been dismissed as despite of public support he is not reinstated yet, has this ever happened in America?
In Pakistan fake degree holder has become the Health Minister, did this happen in America?
By hearing this American laughed like mads and also accepted his defeat.
In the picture, despite being flanked by Americans from all sides, President Zardari is smiling.
From his joy it looks like
He thinks that the Americans are with his government. What he forgets is that these same people were with Musharraf a year before.
This picture has been taken as it was a family gathering
A photo like this was never published in the papers before; one president with three American officials.
It seems the American involvement in Pakistan has increased and more than one official is needed to do the job; or they are not relying on their new puppet the way they relied on the one before him.
This could also have been arranged keeping in mind the stories of President Zardari’s breach of commitments.
If it had been a sensible ruler, at least he would not have been grinning during the photo session and he would have had a subservient and embarrassing look on his face.
If the principle of democracy is applied on this picture then Present Zardari is in minority.
In democracy, majority rules the country and the picture reveals the actual rulers.
The scenic Swat valley is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
The government’s policy so far is to engage in talks besides the use of force.
But the use of force is achieving nothing other than strengthening the Taliban and increase in public sympathies for them.
What is needed of the government is to address the root cause of this menace instead of using force.
With the root causes addressed, Fazalullah and Taliban will die out themselves.
The Shariat Bill by the ANP government will help to address the problem to a great extent.
But the government must address the financial problems in addition to the implementation of Shariat.
from the early steps of General Musharaf, it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians, but the lust of power changed all his plans.
all the hopes were from the participation in the "war of terror", he had started considering himself as immortal.
those steps which were expected, all broke-off.
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, he made a deal with the thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army but never know what's happening to the present government.
Either its Bajor or Swat, the army does not control terror but bombs the "Enemy" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy a mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy.
In Swat, the strongly affected part of Sarhad state, despite the continuity of military action for over one year, the situation is still going from bad to worse.
On one side, the government is only reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly. On the other side, the Taliban's illegal radio FM channel is having much more influence in the region.
On the third side, the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region.
During the action of the security forces, there were claims of destroying the fundamentalists by the bombing of gun ship helicopters and cannon houses, but despite these destructions, the Taliban only became more powerful, and according to an estimation, their control over Swat increased that much percent more.
As a result, on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat, and on the other hand the Taliban is stronger.
Who is stuck in  between? The poor civilians.
It is said in Swat, that someone asked what kind of people are the Taliban were, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of Allah and the religion'.
Then he asked how the army was, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country'.
He then asked who the enemies of the religion and the country were, so he got the answer, 'We civilians'.
I am wondering how the Pakistani Army will fight the Indian Army, when they couldn't control a small faction of the Taliban.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
But still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
After the girls schools, now boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfews are called so that the Taliban can move around easily.
During curfew tonight, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
The question arises as to how they got there despite the curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone explain to the army to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the Army can defeat any enemy.
He says, maximum bloodshed has been done on the base of religion, you tell me in the absence of any religion wont bloodshed occur?
Punjabi, Pathan. white and black, Mehsud and other tribes, are all these created by religion?
Not at all, sir, religion preaches us that there is no white, black, Punjabi or Muhajir, if there is no religion then half of the world would have been destroyed by the war of black and white and remaining half by the war of cast.
Actually religion nourishes human morally and restricts him that he is not here at his own rather is sent by The Creator of Universe and he has to live by God's rules.
As a Muslim I believe that Islam is true religion and a complete code of life.
After moving to London, I used to call my relatives back home every single morning, although they never called us even once. Then I realized they were inconvenienced by our calling as well, so we stopped.
After living in France now for two years, I feel the same way.
I don't know why people always expect us to call them.
Resolution about Iraq passed in a few hours, sending UN peace force to Darfur is not a problem.
Immediate condemning Mumbai battacks and restricting suspected groups can be done in few hours.
And we are negotiating while death is revolving at our heads.
O' world peace claimers!Life is ending here.
If that really awaited for it's ending.
So that no more victim can even imagine to use a weapon of mass destruction like catapult to have his  due rights.
When a father keeps running taking the dead body of his beloved son,even then you don't feel any pain in your heart?
If no,then you are no one to be called a human being.
Instead a blot on the humanity.
At least this was proven that this area was also Israel's country for thousands of years.
What should happen is that both the nations should live together happily and with love but since they are controlled by the west and arab countries, therefore peace can not be formed here with out their consent.
But even Iran wants to fight its proxy war here now.
Even if operations in Israel are stopped for the time being, they will start again after some other incident.
The interests of BBC homeland are affiliated to America and Israel and this is why under the wrapper of 'broadmindedness' it has produced a series of blogs consisted of 'Jewish favor' and is conducting one sided and blind 'propaganda'.
BBC is only carrying the 'formality' and its objective is to have sympathies!
It is requested to Mr. Moderator that he must publish this review so that it may be proved BBC has element of realism to some extent.
Thanks.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How could I not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
This time it is with Dera Ghazi Khan, the country with the heavy rains of the winter season.
According to the weather a poem was created in the present discipline mentioning about the rice rain.
Do you have this heavy rains too?
It has been Bihar in this year.
As the stay has really been.
Never been so like that.
The buttermilk has never been good in the night.
Noise never ever can be the silence.
Do you have this heavy rains too?
Remember any night
It is about the dust buried.
It seems that Israel will never be.
And never burned themselves
The grief was in a gradual.
Do you have this heavy rains too?
All these leaders are going to run away with their briefcases in hand, what do they care about what will happen to the country.
Let the population sell toothpaste or clean the bells of the Mandir with the peels of lemons.
And then our media is also fraudulent like our leaders.
The purpose of it is to get money out of the government, and nothing else.
And as far as the population goes they can remain stupid because talking about them would be an even bigger stupidity.
Yesterday noon strange thing happened.
The whole police was running here and there but was least bothered about illegal parking.
Not this, NYPD traffic was not in the mood of noticing illegally parked vehicles.
What happened was, an airplane of US Air crash landed in the Hudson River.
Till now the only information pulled out was, ""the terrorists"" were of goose breed.
Yesterday it might be the historic cold in New york.
The temperature does not fall to this extent.
My jaw start to ache because of half an hour outside walk.
Just imagine what would have happened with those who jumped of the plane into the river.
A matter of relief as all the people were safe.
The dark side is that the Company's plane crashed in this financial crises.
While watching all this I went to New Jersey by West Side Highway. I Noticed that South Bound is blocked, still what I did?
Yes, I was jammed in it on my way back.
Thanks God,during my an hour trip the road was bit cleared as I get an exit from 56 street.
Otherwise I did not avail the first two exit due to the long lanes of vehicles.

For no reason, we thought that the Taliban group from Sawat was non religious, who were only against women education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
But like majority of the ideas, this was not proven right also. According to this news of CNN, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a Boys school with gunpowder.
Swat, The Taliban has destroyed a boys school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Amen, then Amen.
Masha Allah, up till now, 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom of fixing marriages before birth among Muslims, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See a picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
just a while before this, the wedding of a dog with a girl took place.
look at that groom.
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
Today is the age of computer and computer's interference is growing in every aspect of life.
Lots of people have many reservations about this growing interference of computer like in financial issues.
As you have facilities for using credit cards but by this law enforcement agencies has also firmer grip on your private life.
That just by tracking the record of your credit card you can be exposed.
And in future when use of currency will be minimal its utility will increase.
Similarly in crimes world there is no need to rob the bank, information of credit card are hacked.
Similarly friendship has become computerized
, social networking websites like Orcet, Facebook and MySpace are ranked first in popularity.
But don't you feel that the more closer we are getting of these sites mentally, practically moving further away from people.
Similarly there is the website of match making, where by knowing your choice you are provided with a list of people according to your likings.
Can you spend life with your own cologne (of course not physical)?
I can't do it, that is why a life partner is known as better half.
That he/she may cover my deficiencies.
Perhaps I received a lesser share of wisdom.
From childhood, I thought of everything as being true if it was told by an elder.
In the same way, I was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world.
I was even ridiculed a lot on this
But only that seemed true which was plausible.
I was always perplexed at the need of telling a lie.
Even suffered in this part of my age because of this
So I tried to keep the lies at a minimum.
I refrained from giving false hopes to others particularly with Allah’s name
And only say God willing when it was my wish that the work was to be done
Besides Allah knows what is there in the hearts.
This is a disgusting problem which rears its head due to the ignorance of the religion.
According to both our religion and the law in Pakistan, infants should remain with their mother.
Their father is responsible for their maintenance allowance and he can meet them.
Then when the kids become mature they can decide with whom they want to live.
You have mentioned correctly that the real problem is the relatives who poison the minds.
Our behavior is over taken by feudal thinking
Ever here this way of thinking is working that new co-sharers will be born in father's property and this is where the opposition is shown. Otherwise their father's this behavior is worth praise and pursuance.
With reference to relationships, these forceful affiliation has created evil in our society.
Concept of marriage of a divorced or a widow is ending.
These absurd beliefs and baseless traditions are the reason family breakups.
In our society, if wife of a 50-55 year old man or husband of a woman goes to the next world and he marries again, why is he not respected?
There is a Pakistani uncle living close to us, his wife passed away around 10-12 years ago. Now after all his children got married, he married a widow, for which his kids have turned against him.
In my point of view, it is their religious right, what do you say?
What type of mentality is the 'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place', kind of mentality?
In my opinion the children of this person should think that after having married all the kids, is there anything wrong in his marrying a widow?
This way the widow gets a caretaker and uncle also gets someone who will take care of his home.
Because his children would certainly be busy in their worldly affairs and would not be having time for him.
The reason behind this is ignorence.
In future what if their wives refused to work for the old man?
This is the outcome of the social pressure.
Childeren feel ashamed on the second marriage of their father when people make jokes of such family on this action.
Where as they must face the circumstances and say that what their father did,it was just according to Islam.
This is a curse in our society in which we are sunk since last 40 to 50 years.
Even a wife is agreed on the unethical activities of her husband but does not allow her for second marriage.
If she had the power She wont allow him of this even after her death.
Along with husband spoils her afterlife too and causes an increase in corruption in society.
Nothing happens with singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.
And about your question, when sir instead of bringing his wife home, goes to someone else's wife so the dependents just make a fuss for the show and stay quiet and satisfied. ( yeah, later the relatives of the wife get angry)
In IndopPak we embraced Islam centuries ago but can't get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then Islam.
Second marriage of man as ridiculous, divorce as stigma, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as disgrace and man's marriage with an elder woman as the result of her cunningness is all because of such thinking.
Moreover to copy the western nations we declare veil and worship backward.
It was easy to embrace Islam to get rid of such thinking is very difficult.
Allah bless us all the courage for it.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never that difficult.
Centuries passed in writing this little.
Consider it enough.
Allah Hafiz.
Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes that i found this secret in my life that if leader of any Army is in front line then that Army will never lose.
But here situation is else.
To say that Common people are there to die for us if we die then martyr
if someone from common people dies then murder
May Allah bless and have mercy on you.
When I was coming back to the shop after Isha prayer tonight, one man who was sitting in  car, raised his hand and asked me to come.
I thought may be this man has forgotten his way or may be he wants to ask something. I stopped so his whole family was in his car.
He asked if I can understand Arabic very well or not. I said that there is no problem. You tell me what is the matter.
He started saying, I have come from Riyadh but here some one in Medina picked my pocket if you please help me. I said forget about it.Because  this has happened with me earlier also as I gave this man 20 riyals to pay for gas and go back to Riyadh but he started doing the same thing after moving forward a little.
I got really angry and when I told him and threaten him of a cop, he vanished from there.
So now this is the condition of us Muslims that even when we come to beg money, we come with families riding in cars and daily manage to get at least 2 to 3000.
Although there is an evident saying of the Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the hand above is better than the hand below and the hand above is the giving hand the lower is the taking hand.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims ( Amen)
Wassalam

The wife of famous singer Adnan Sami reached went to police station for blaming him of torturing her
, police has advised her to consult the court.
Saba Galadari wife of Adnan Sami has filed an application against him that Adnan Sami continuously tortures her
and behaves inhumanly,
Now she is fed up of this therefore case must be filed against him
, in place of filing case police asked her to consult the court by saying that this case is not under the jurisdiction of police.
In your opinion the blame of Adnan Sami's wife on him is true?
Is it not an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Do inform us with your opinion in this regard.
Adam Sanghar, Meher
As far as the allegations are concerned, anyone can levy them on any other person.
There is nothing superior to honor.
Whatever is the current state of relations between Adnan Sami and his wife, Adnan Sami left his respectable life and went to India to earn a fortune. The same fame has now importuned him.
It is the outcome of his wrong doings.
Washington
American high officials have stated that President Obama will take a stern attitude towards the Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
The new American strategy towards Afghanistan will focus on war instead of development
The officials said that Hamid Karzai is being viewed as an obstacle in achieving American interests in Afghanistan because of government corruption and drug trafficking is on the rise and the Talibans are gaining strength
The American officials also said that those people in the current administration who are pressurizing Hamid Karzai to do more include, Vice President Joe Biden and American Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrook
They stated that the policy change came after President Bush left office, who used to have video conferencing with Hamid Karzai fortnightly and emphasized the American role in the rebuilding of Afghanistan and its civil institutions.
The Obama administration will work with provincial political leaders instead of the central government.
They said that they will ask Hamid Karzai to intensify the campaign against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing new elections this year and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his administration are going to back him up in the presidential race.
Does this statement reflect a shift in American policy towards Afghanistan?
Is Hamid Karzai’s era coming to an end?
What is your say on this?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and SriLanka, Srilanka defeated Pakistan with 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Srilanka in the first one-day match although Srilanka won in the next two matches.
In this third one-day match, the nation's team performance was very poor. They worn out in only 75 runs in 23 overs against 309 runs made by the national team of Srilanka.And this is how we faced a lesson learning defeat.
the result of the series proves that the National team has no consistency in its performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
which departments of the game should be addressed more by the authorities?
are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
which department you will hold responsible for the defeat, fielding, batting or bowling?
please provide your feedback.
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish  traditions continue. these feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule, who would call them Muslims?
a Sardar should walk himself over these embers. why the present government do not act against them?
when the judicial justice will come in handy.
Sir Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan for playing one day international series.
Visit of a foreign team to Pakistan, in spite of Pak India tension is a good sign.
On reaching Karachi Airport the Sir Lankan team was given a warm welcome.
Two matches will be held between Pakistan and Sir Lanka in Karachi while the third one will be played in Lahore.
Both teams are asserting highly regarding their batting, bowling and fielding.
If Siri Lanka venerates its spinners, Pakistan’s reliance is on its fast bowlers.
Sir Lanka’s captain Mahela Jayawardene says that no one player but the whole Pakistan cricket team is dangerous.
Muralidharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, while Pakistan’s captain says that this competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik has said “we have played Murali Dharan before and will take care of Mendis as well. We have made a secret game plan and will reveal it on the ground”.
Will the Pakistan and Sir Lanka series live up to claims of being interesting and thrilling?
Which side will dominate in the Pakistan and Siri Lanka series?
Who will win the series?
Who will be man of the series?
Inform us of your suggestions.
Gulfam from London has published his own statement, you also give importance to such statements. We wish you also write some truth .and do not change statement like Mukherjee, because it is an order to say truth to the despotic ruler is legitimate. And it is equal to jihad. Mukherjee keeps changing his statements to stay in news.

It is all these people's doing Kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years.
No, no one  asked, now they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism so they have started talking about peace and settlement.
First they generally massacred Muslims now they are perplexedly settling the matters.
In any way Pakistan has to understand their duplicitous policies.
Asad Khan: London
India is making situations so that the Kashmir situation is overlooked.
But Pakistan has always shown India's true face to the world.
Even the British government is now understanding this, that is why India is now ruining Pakistan's reputation by terrorism accusations to distract from the Kashmir situation.
And hesitates to talk with Pakistan about this.
Britains Secretary of State David Miliband said that resolving Kashmir issue will finish off the extremism and the government of Pakistan will be able to tackle the dangers faced at the border efficiently
It should be noted that recently the newly elected American President Obama has also expressed similar thoughts on the Kashmir issue
Britains Secretary of State said in front of media in Mumbai and also wrote that the idea of war against terrorism is wrong.Killing people  for the sake of threats being faced had been the policy of President Bush
David Milliband said that Pakistan should not have any soft corner for the extremist groups
Is India creating uncertainity in the region to avoid the resolution of Kashmir issue by big powers?
Are the Mumbai attacks the part of the plan?
Does India want to avoid the comprehensive talks by on the basis of terrorism?

Usman Aftab.
I think Super powers don't want to destroy Pakistan
rather they are thinking of certain policies to control her they are familiar that Pakistan is an atomic power
want to bring some sort of revolution
Foreign countries believe that by cornering Pakistan few hurdles may generate want to support Pakistan and also wish to achieve their goal
A citizen,USA
Hindus always hit hard and then start speaking sweet.
I think that they get problems often in a while and they start threatning Pakistan.
We are ready from each aspect.Indian army chief should better shut his mouth up else we are capable to cross attacking.
Faheem Siddique
Raas Al Khaima, It is due to America that wrong statements are being given , America is out of its mind but now India is also doing the same, India should try attacking , then it will become crystal clear that who stands where.
Israel is attacking Hammas but nobody has that much integrity to stop them. India also want to follow Israel's foot steps
Prime Minister Syed YOusaf Raza Gillini said that the newly elected vice president Joe Biden had played an important role in steping down of previous president musharraf as army cheif and restoring crippled democracy, thats why the government of pakistan has awarded him with Sitare-e-Imtiaz (honour medal)
No political party shoud get credit of his  giving up of uniform and restoration of the democracy , Parliment is not a mere rubber stamp
All decisions will be taken in the parliment
Prime minister said that the chapter of Doctor Qadeer has been closed
What do you think, the peoples protest against dictatorship has no value at all?

U.S. President George W. Bush in his farewell press conference advised the newly elected President Barak Obama by saying that he has done many mistakes in his presidency and if Barak Obama finds something right,just do it.
As the President I have taken steps according to  the situation and the Constitution and  under the law,  given priority to the American interests on my popularity.
He said that the  US enemy is still  planning to attack the America , and the biggest challenge  for Barak  Obama would have  been to stop the attacks.
He said that not to get the Mass destruction weapons,  was  my largest  disappointment and  the biggest mistake was to admit the completion of the Iraq   mission.
While addressing the American Pesident  in the White House in his last press conference has said that it is my last press conference I thank to journalists and other friends who attended  this Conference .
Do you think that Obama will not repeat those mistakes   which were done by Bush?
Has it been delayed by Bush to acknowledge  the mistake?
Shall Obama  follow the advice of  Bush conciliatory?

America is ambitious on the arrest of Usama and the search of Usama is on.
Will Dick Cheney's wish of arresting Usama be accomplished?

The Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has once again accused Pakistan of provoking for a war.
And Pakistan is using terrorism as a state policy.
while addressing a Chief Ministers conference in new Delhi, Manmohan Singh said that the terrorist elements are backed by neighboring countries specially Pakistan.
and the terrorists of the Mumbai attacks used the pelagic route and were safe from the Indian coast guards.
Indian prime minister said that the November attacks were carried out by Lashkare Taiba.
he added that the terrorists are using modern techniques and the latest communication systems. We'll have to be more rigorous over the line of control where in the intrusion takes place. He said that terrorism will not be spared in any case and this is our policy.
how do you see this allegation from the Indian prime minister?
Is the internal chaos and separation movements of India not the show of India's anxiety?
On whose signals is India has chosen to be in threatening attitude?
Let us know of your opinion
Zubair Khan, Karachi
It is extremely sad that the Israelis are openly killing Palestinians. Over here, Kashmir is in the same situation but the Peace Council does not even turn a ear over it.
All the groups that are in Kashmir and Palestine, should keep the war going for freedom, and unitedly fight any force that opposes them. One day their martyrdom will bear fruit, God willing.
Israeli air attacks are still continued on Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
The important leader of Hamas Nazaar Rayyan and family has been martyred.
The Security Council session ended without any decision.
America has opposed the censure resolution against Israel submitted by Lebia and other Arab countries in the session.
Israeli airplanes bombardment is continued since many days on Palestinian civil population.
The whole world reacted on Mumbai attacks but no country including America and England can see bloodshed caused by Israeli attacks.
Why the major countries of Muslim world are silent?
What will you wish to say on this double standard of the world.

I think the actual point that the majority of our nation in illetrate. They even dont   know where their money is going to. Government  is interested in applying taxes and fullfil their duties. Electricity and Gas shortage will remain same.
Because who are elected by public are very well known
The crisis of electricity and gas has worsen in whole of the Pakistan
, on the other hand gas prices have been raised by average 8, while in few cities unavailability of petrol created immense worry for people.
Intense reactions, riots and torturous demonstration are continued in the industrial and business circles of Pakistan against the crisis of electricity and gas.
Industrialists have threatened a shutdown ultimatum.
In Karachi people are worried due to 8 to 10 hours load shedding.
Industrial sector is almost paralyzed.
Government Institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other.
Increasing the prices of electricity and gas is not a joke with people?
Why the solutions of the problems are not considered?
Is government not seeing the full stop on national development?
What steps you will instantly recommend for managing this crisis?
Let us know your opinion.
Imran Khokar from Madīnah Munawwarah, “I would like to say that rulers are a reflection of society’s morality.
I am surprised that a government claiming to be people’s friendly is unfriendly to the people.
Non-Availability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a menace.
The government does not have any control over the institutions.
The law and order situation is worsening day by day. May Allah have mercy on the country.

During Bush's eight years rule, the historical attacks and destruction of the World Trade Center, attack on Pentagon and then in the name of war against terror, attacking Afghanistan and Iraq and involving forces from other countries into the war and use of American resources in it have become memorable examples of his time.
due to this war America itself faced the worst ever economical and financial crisis in history.

the Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, in an interview with Jeev News said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour, but due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step? Should sports not be separated from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision not harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that the security condition in India is bad, the England cricket team is continuing its tour, so why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this?
Salman Karachi
People who are proud to go to India
And make their films and own Videos  should now open their eyes and see that how Indians respect you
I remember an interview of adnan sami in which he said that I am not a Pakistani, my nationality is British.
Adnan Sami should come back to Pakistan in first chance because he is not to be respested there as well

Indians got a change in their attitude after Mumbai attacks
Jugjeet singh started hating Pakistan and Pakistanis as its reaction.
The point to ponder is that Adnan Sami has sang songs with Aasha Bhonsle.So he is not a bad voiced singer.Adnan Sami should stay in India,no need to come there.
Muhammad Shah AAlam
Regarding Jagjit Singh I would tell that he changes colors like a chameleon .
The one who is taking care of situation gives opinion about it.The people of pakistan open up your eyes and see that you are greatly respected in India.Understand their feelings.
After the Mumbai attack their feeling of hate has increased.Now they are talking against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to foreign news agency the situation has become funny when President Bush along with Prime Minister Noor Almalki in press conference at his office in Baghdad when an Iraqi journalist said to President Bush, ""Dog, this is farewell kiss"".
After this journalist removed his shoe and threw it at Bush, President bush expertly moved his head out of the way and saved himself.
Second shoe hit the American flag.
Security officials dragged him out of there.
On this occasion President Bush said I don't know why he did this, shoe was of size 10, I was not bothered.
Do you think that this action by the journalist depicts the anger of Iraqi people against President Bush.
What will you say about this?

Its true that they were killed but we feel sorry that they killed many innocent people in Karachi,at which they feel proud that Naseer Ullah Baber did a good job
But later,changed at all.
But it's also true that they ignored the seniors of their party and nominated their own son as the representative of People's Party.What sort of democracy is it?
Jimmy Noor,Karachi,This news has proved Quran's statement that a non Muslim will actually help an other non Muslim.
But if the iron axe doesnt contains the handle,it can' cut any thing.
Our leaders own these styles,they are adopting secret ways,that's why our country is suffering with hardships.
May Allah Almighty show the right path to our leaders.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations have included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed as well as two other Pakistani citizens and that of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organisations into the list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaidah and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, practically non-existent organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba Operation Chief, Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organisations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organisations, they will be restricted from traveling and will be under arrest.
They will have to face cases.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India blaming these parties for the Bombay attacks without any proof?
Aren't there any terrorist groups in India?
Are International groups not aware of the tortures being done on the minorities in India?
Please inform us with your suggestions.

Our rulers should understand that the people they are fighting against are our own. Who are taking upon every problem because they love Pakistan
If there would be war then they will fight for Pakistan.
When their love would be felt, just condenming politics will not work. I think between both, there might be going a resulting war.
