Avoid dieting..Prevent flu.
American scientists found this to be true from experimenting on mice.
Results proved that mice on a lower calorie diet had comparatively less ability to fight the flu virus.
Research disproved the old axiom, "It is better to fast during a fever".
According to scientists, one should eat during a fever.
Researchers at The Michigan State University said that mice, who were fed a lower calorie diet had less ability to fight flu symptoms than their counterparts who were eating a normal diet.  Studies also showed that their chances of death from the flu virus also increased.  Mice eating a normal diet had the strength to fight off the virus and live a longer life.
Professor Elizabeth Gardner said that those who are dieting are not only sooner affected by the flu, but also take longer to recover.
She also said that those who have taken flu vaccines should avoid dieting for a few months during the winter.
First Nuclear Test Done in 1990.
Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer, had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.
In this book called 'Nuclear Express,' the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.
Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Thomas Reid said that due to many factors, he is certain that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Among the factors are the design of the bomb and information he gathered from Chinese scientists.
He further added that that was the reason that Pakistan was able to reply to India's Nuclear test with a nuclear test, in just 2 weeks and 3 days.
Thomas Reid reminded us that in 1961, Russia suddenly performed a nuclear test. In response, America took 17 days to preform a test, despite having this bomb for a long time.
He further said that atomic bomb test Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998 was made with extreme care, and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.
When Thomas Reeds was questioned about China providing nuclear technology to Pakistan he replied that India was a common enemy for Pakistan and China.
He said that there is a proof that Doctor Abdul Qadeer Khan used Chinese designs, and the documents which were acquired from Libya confirm this statement.
He further stated that doing combined nuclear tests is common, and that in 1990 the United States conducted a nuclear test for Britain on an open belt in the Nevada desert.
He said that he also assumed that Israel was given access to the results of this test.
Thomas Reed was also questioned whether the Chinese nuclear spread program is continuing?
On this, Thomas Reed said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and design to a nuclear facility in Iran's city Isfahan since 1990.
Additionally, China provided Iran a nuclear enrichment plant.
He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen thorough North Korea.

Speaking to the protesters, senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, Federal Union of Journalists, C.R. Shamsi said that the politicians used to protest with us until yesterday on the streets, today they have become rulers and are sitting in the parliament. Fearing a certain lobby of the media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of the journalists.
He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.
An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.
He said that there should be firm steps taken against the TV and newspaper owners, and the journalists should put a protest camp in front of the parliament to get their rights.

According to Mazhar Abbas, in 50% of the Pakistani newspapers and TV channels the workers and journalists were being exploited, where they work without any agreement.
He said that until now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been removed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is being feared that the owners will remove hundreds more in the present year, making an excuse of the present financial crisis.
Mazhar Abbas said that the journalist movement will continue until removed employees are reinstated, newspaper wages fixed by the Seventh Wage board award are enforced, and the salaries owed by TV channels and newspaper workers is paid.

Administrator for Jamat-ud-Dawa
The headquarter of Jamat-ud-Dawa, Tayyaba Center, is almost 25 kilometers away from Lahore near Mureedkay.
This center has a hospital, a school and also a hostel for students.
The law minister of Punjab, Rana Sanaullah Khan, says that the assignment of a superintendent in the Jamat-ud-Dawa center came into being so that the work of the welfare organizations present there is not disturbed.
According to Khalid Waleed, the son-in-law of Chief of Jamat-ud-Dawa Hafiz Saeed, qualified government official Khaqan Babar is appointed as an administrator to monitor the hospital, schools and other welfare organizations located in the center. Although, according to them, there has also been an increase in the police staff.
The Security Council of the United Nations has placed restrictions on Jamat-ud-Dawa after which Pakistan's federal government did an operation against Jamat-ud-Dawa in the entire country. Many leaders were placed under house arrest, including Ameer Hafiz Saeed. The assignment of an administrator in the Tayyaba center from the government of Punjab was also part of the series of actions by the federal government against Jamat-ud-Dawa.
Khaqan Babar is related to DMG (District Management Group).
Hafiz Khalid Waleed has said that Lahore division commissioner Khusro Parvez Khan came to the Tayyaba Center on Sunday with the police and civil authorities and inspected several parts of the center. Khalid Waleed has disapproved of placement of an administrator from the government in the Jamat-ud-Dawa Center. It is also said that earlier operations of the government have already decreased the number of patients in the hospital and students in the school.

It says in the letter that the one sided decision of the Security Council on banning Jamat-ud-Dawa is unfair. And Jamat-ud-Dawa has no relation with terrorism but it is busy in charitable activities.

Azam Suwati is an independent candidate and was elected a senator and is one of the richest senators.

Bolochistan, Blasted Pipeline
According to police, this is a 18-inch diameter pipeline which connects different wells of Parekoh and meets the Suyi gas pipeline. This was blasted by unidentified men in the early morning.
Apart from this, yesterday, well number 3 near Suyi had been totally destroyed by a blast and a gas pipeline near Dera-allayar was also damaged due to a blast.
Militant organization Baloch republican army's spokeperson, Saryaz Baluch, accepted the responsibility for these blasts on the behalf of his organization.

This month, until now, several gas pipelines have been blasted.  Attacks on trains and on people belonging to the Punjab region have also increased.
Though the Prime Minister of Baluchistan, Nawab Aslam Rayisani, has expressed concern over such activities and ordered the police to exchange information from intelligence agencies, stopping such incidents has not been possible yet.
$819 billion economic revival package approved
No member of the Republican party voted for President Obama's plan.
Members of the Republican Party said that the economic plan is very expensive and will not prove effective.
240 votes were cast in favor of this package in the members assembly whereas 160 were cast against it.
This economic revival plan will be presented next week in the Senate where the ruling Democratic party has very little majority.
Concern is being expressed that great opposition from the Republican Party may make it difficult to obtain Senate approval.
After the approval of economic revival plan, Barack Obama insisted that this important plan should not cause political disagreement.
The president said that this plan, which hoped would be enacted by next month, will prove to make a peaceful atmosphere in the country and enhance the American economy.
According to this plan, the public will be forgiven of loans from $275 billion to $540 billion for roads, bridges, 10,000 schools, unemployment benefits and research for new technology.
BBC writer Richard Luster has said in Washington that Barack Obama intended to introduce a new political culture by eliminating political disagreements, but discussion about this economic package has once again made politicians sore.
Republican Party members, among the representatives of the senate, called the proposed bill a waste of government money, and they said that it will not help in creating new employment opportunities.
They emphasized that the bill passed by their party placed more importance on tax cuts.
They said that more employment opportunities could be formed with less capital through their bill.
They said that compared to constructive plans, more employment opportunities could be formed through tax cuts.
Bitterness between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Israeli president, almost screaming, that the blood of many humans were spilled in Gaza, and it saddened him to see that people could watch and applaud this armed killing from Israel.
Mr. Erdogan said, "I believe that you are using such words to erase your guilty feeling, and out loud, as well. But you killed those people, and I am remembering those children who were killed near the shore."
Simon said that Gaza's calamity is not Israel, but Hamas, who have established a dangerous dictatorship over there.
A BBC journalist from Davos said that he had never seen such a scene in an global economic forum before.
However, Erdogan later stated that he respected the Israeli president and his age, which is why he did not scream at him, but whatever he was saying was very far from the truth.
Turkey is one of the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, but for the last few years there has been tension between them.
The attacks were not planned in Pakistan.
Speaking to Indian news channel NDTV, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said that the report of the Pakistani investigations into the Mumbai blast will be prepared soon.
In the attacks that took place in Mumbai last Novemeber, more than 170 people were killed.
India claims that extremist group Lashkar-e-Taiba is responsible for the attacks.
India also said that Pakistani "state factors" were responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
The Mumbai attacks affected relations between the two countries.
High commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan gave his first statement about the report of the Pakistani investigations, from which it becomes evident as to what is within the report.
Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that as far as the investigation has deteremined, Pakistani land has not been used.
It must be some other place, not England.
These are the two places (Pakistan and Britain) about which I was worried.
India and the international community have created a lot of pressure on Pakistan to take action against the culprits of the Mumbai attacks.
Wajid Shamsul Haq said: We are not trying to cover it up.
We believe in taking action based on facts.
The world will accept our investigations.
We will try to satisfy India over the results of the investigation.
While defending the delay in the investigation in Pakistan, he said that it takes time to collect, understand and check these kind of things.
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Haq said that it took 45 days for India to present its dossier.
A black man elected as the republican leader too.
In the sixth round of elections in the Republican party, Michael Steel has won, receiving 91 votes out of 168.
In the selection for the post of Chairman, the candidate opposing Steele, Katon Dawson, got 77 votes, whereas the ex-Chairman Duncan withdrew from the competition in the second stage.
Newspaper writers say that among the five candidates who stood for the chairmanship of the Republican Party, Michael Steele was considered the most moderate leader.
After winning, Michael Steele said in his speech, "We are going to tell our friends and foes together that they can join with us, but whoever wants to spoil this, they should be ready to be separated from us." Michael Steele is from Maryland, where he was Deputy Governor.
He rose to fame in 2006, when he ran for a Senate seat.
After losing the Senatorial election, he became the chairman of the Political Conservative Committee of the party.
Now, after being selected the chairman of the party, the country-wide projects of the party will be under his supervision.
He fought in the election, promising that he would take the party in a new direction, and that he would use new techniques to join old-fashioned supporters with the party.
The Indian claim of the presence of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaysh-e-Mohammad in Jammu.
There are reports of the presence of militants in the Ponch province of Jammu.
According to government sources, upon receiving secret reports, the police and the army have surrounded the region and have begun searching.
Meanwhile, a fight started in which 4 extremists, 2 tribunes and 1 policeman died.
According to eyewitnesses, the fight continued until troops of Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and Jaish-e-Mohammad arrived. More soldiers have been sent.
Chief Minister Umer Abdullah, appointed by conflate government, met with the Governor and told him about him being selected by his National Conference party.
National Conference's allied party Congress also informed the Governor about their support for Umer Abdullah.
Umer Abdullah will take the oath tomorrow as Chief Minister.
In recent local elections, National Conference gained 28 seats to win. Those parties who supported separation opposed elections and boycotted it.
Congress, who got 17 seats has agreed to make a combined government with National Conference.
Party members greeted Umer Abdullah with a warm welcome on his arrival today in Sri Nagar.
Umer Abdullah said he will play his role in patching up talks between Indian government and separation supporters. However, until the Indian elections and before the new government is elected, this will be difficult.
The European Union's role in Peace in the Middle East
Of the diplomatic efforts going on to stop the war in the Middle East,if looked at from a government perspective, those of the European Union are the most decisive.
According to the state policy of Brussels, the efforts of the Shwarzenburg delegation or those of Sarkozy, are similar to giving a helping hand.
The spokesperson of the European Commission, Amadeu Altafaj, said that every effort which helps advancing the joint message of the European Union to the two parties is welcome.
As far as the state policy is concerned, everyone seems alright.
However, in reality, the European Union is in a sad state of internal differences.
As the President of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is weak.
On top of that, internal fighting has made it all the more helpless.
On the other hand, French President, Sarkozy's demeanor is such that one would think he was the president of the Union.
Though, France has completed it's six month presidency period.
Sarkozy wants to play a presidential role, and he is able to, but he does not have the permission to do so.
The Foreign Minister of France, Bernard Kouchner, faces a most ridiculous situation.
He is part of the delegation, which is being headed by Schwarzenberg, the Foreign Minister of the Czech Republic.
What's worse, both the foreign ministers are giving different statements about the war in the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself whereas according to Kouchner this war does not come under defense policy. On the other side, Germany has also sent its special ambassador to Middle East. European Union will not succeed on a foreign platform until they express agreement based on the same issues.
Its evidence is the reaction of Israel who does not pay an importance to the conciliation efforts of the EU.
The EU has a golden opportunity to get something done, due to American Middle Eastern policy under President George W. Bush.
Economic Setback Leads to Suicide of German Billionaire
Adolf Meerklay, residing in the Sawabia in southern Germany, left behind a great business group.
Previously, most German citizens did not know much about him.
Later when he had to conference, about the loan given to his industrial group, with almost 30 banks for many weeks, he also became topic of the headlines. And he could see a dark future of Meerklay groups.
The Merkle group had to face the loss of a few hundred million euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 million to one billion euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle was under intense pressure.
Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had got to this position from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic power.
After the death of his father, Adolf Merkel took over his family business and developed it quickly, putting on new lines.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 billion and 6 billion euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion euros a year. After the superb success of Ratiopharm, the Merkel Group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel Group around the world is near 100,000, and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical company Ratiopharm, always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years."
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have approved 400 million euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.
After the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain the same.
Crime rate among the immigrants in Germany.
According to the fresh statistics, crime rate among the immigrants from 2004 to 2007 is
Reduced from 9.22%
to 4.21%
According to Joachim Herrmann, the interior minister of Baweria province, this is a positive change.
He said: "It is important to note that the number of foreigners getting German citizenship is increasing."
Therefore it should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German, his background is foreign.
Herrmann said that his province will take this in to account when gathering statistics in 2010.
Besides Baweria, Hamburg is also thinking in the same lines.
A senator for foreign affairs from CDU, Christoph Ahlhaus, has said: "When research is done in a scientific manner, man can not pre-decide its results but it is based on the facts and figures that come out as a result of the research."
Ahlhaus diverted attention to a research report from the anti-crime provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamburg, it was discovered that out of all crimes happening there is a percentage that have the involvement of foreigners.
results showed that the foreigners here have
Tthe crime rate was less as compared to crime all over the province.
By contrast, when a survey was done in 2006 on crimes in youth in Berlin, it was determined that young people having foreign background had a percentage of 44%.
was 7 percent
However, other political parties of Germany for example, SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei,were against this proposal that while collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired which German citizens have foreign backgrounds.
We want quick evacuation of troops from Gaza: Olmert
Ehud Olmert has stressed that for complete evacuation of the army, a future and permanent ceasefire agreement is inevitable.
Hamas and Israel declared ceasefire on Sunday.
Islamic militant group Hamas while announcing a one week cease fire has asked the Israel army to leave the Gaza strip within one week and to end the barricade on the Gaza strip.
On other side, the leader of Hamas Ismail Hannan has said that Israel has been given victory from God in the Gaza war.
He said that in Gaza war, Israel has not been able to achieve its purpose.
Before that, in the city of Sharm Al Sheikh, Egypt, a conference was held of Arab and European countries on Sunday. Israel was asked to evacuate its army from Gaza immediately.
It was decided in the conference that soon an international aid conference will be held for Gaza.
German Chancellor Angela Meerkal also attended the conference.
At least 1300 Palestinians including 10 soldiers and a total of 13 Israelis were killed in the war lasting for three weeks between the militants of Hamas and Israel.
On the other side, Palestinian President Mahmood Abbas has insisted on the formation of national government in the areas of Palestine.
A video message for Germany from Al-Qaeda
In this 30 minute video message, a man wearing a black turban with a covered face and holding a gun is giving a message to the German Government.
This person is showing himself Abu Talha and speaking in the German language.
All titles of this Arabic video message are present.
The logo of Alqaida is on the screen side and the date is 2008 in the video.
In this message it is said to the German government that the large numbers of troops in Afghanistan shows that there will be no attack.
However the saying himself Abu Talha that person did not threat German without channel.
The number of NATO forces in Afghanistan is about 3500.
The German parliment had approved the sending 1000 more to Afghanistan.
This is the first message of Alaqaid to Germany.
A distinguished expert in terrorist matters, Mijail Luder, said about this message that the situation in Kabul is that the self attack outside of a German ambassador's house proves that we should take it seriously.
For the last few years Alqaida has been issuing such messages after attacks were undertaken.
The responsibility of the suicide bomb attack outside the German Embassy in Kabul has been accepted by the armed organization called the Taliban.
Most of the German magazines were associating these attacks with Al Qaeda.
They are targeting Germany.
The fundamentalist Muslims are seeing German Afghan policy as negative and discriminatory.
They are blaming Germany for keeping discriminatory policies not only in Afghanistan but in the Middle East as well.
And because of this they are considering Germany their target forever.
In the meantime, the German Government says that the German intelligence agencies already knew about this video before it came to light.
The German department for the elimination of crimes is busy analyzing this video.
Obama has become the American president.
In this perspective, keeping the American people aside, all the world has developed various expectations for Obama.
Now that Barack Obama is receiving congratulatory messages from around the world after winning the presidency, expectations of him are also becoming clear.
The German Chancellor, Angela Merchel, also expressed hopes for the new American president.
"I believe that the Joint Republic of Germany and the United States of America will be able to get together on the basis of a strong relationship and partnership to solve the problems facing us."
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that Obama seems like a serious and open-hearted person, qualities he felt were positive.
As such, the previous American president's policies were subject to criticism.
However, the previous administration is definitely credited with persuading China to play a more constructive role on the international level. With regards to the new president, China's leader has said that he will have to work for strong military ties between the countries.
Gosuwe Hu, an expert on Chinese politics active in Bokhum, Germany, says:
From this viewpoint, I am certain that Obama and his economic team will, within the coming weeks and months, pressure the Beijing government into pegging the Chinese currency at a stable and market-representing exchange rate.
The previous American administration also increased ties with India.
About where Obama might take those ties, Professor Christopher Raj, expert on American sciences in New Delhi, says that we are now closer to a strategic partnership, but Obama cannot make any changes overnight.
Pope Benedict's message to President Obama stressed the need to create an environment of peace and mutual help in the world.
State Elections In Israel
This is the first important election in this war-torn country since 2005.
More than 14,400 people entered the race for 440 seats in the state elections.
To maintain peace and safety during the elections, 800,000 police and soldiers were posted in Iraq.
All Iraqi borders were sealed one day in advance fearing that a random bomb blast or terrorist attack might occur on this important day, especially Friday.
Also, airports were closed and restrictions were placed on public transportation.
According to reports, due to the restrictions on public transportation, there was no traffic on Baghdad roads and children were spotted playing football there.
During the present Iraqi elections, security arrangements will reveal whether the local security agencies will be able to control the country after the return of American forces in 2011. Political analysts also are using this as a test to see how far the public is willing to go to bring about democratic change.
The state elections are being overseen by the United Nations and nearly 800 international supervisors.
Today, the Day of Aashura was celebrated throughout Iran in remembrance,  and respect and honor was paid to the great sacrifice of the chief of all martyrs, Imam Hussain.
According to Mehr news agency, all small and large cities including the capital city of Tehran witnessed the celebration of this day in the respect of the chief of martyrs, Imam Husain, with great respect and honor. On this occasion, the believers gathered in great numbers in such honorary gatherings and remembered the deaths of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) and his family members.

Retreat of Israeli soldiers from Ajleen province of Gaza, unmatched  by forbearance of Palestinian soldiers.
According to the Urdu service of Mehr news agency, even on the 16th day of the fight between truth and falsehood in Gaza, there was beastly bombing by the Israel on the city population  of Gaza, by the use of air, land and naval attacks. Due to this 880 people have died so far.
Among the martyred are 275 innocent children, who have slept in the lap of death, smiling at the deception of the leaders of Arab countries and of so called human rights organizations.
Today the always ready to die Mujahids of Ajeen province have defeated the Israeli army with the power of faith and martyrdom, and a show of amazing forbearance and steadfastness, tightening the collar of life, around the necks of the Zionist enemies.
If it were not for the deception of Egyptian president, Hasani (not) Mubarak, the brave and loyal Hamas Mujahids would have defeated Israel a long while ago, but apart from the Israeli siege, the Egyptians have also placed Palestinian Muslima under siege, which is the saddest story of Arab history.
Here, the Saudi Arabian and Jordanian governments are giving the Israeli government political and economic support, and are helping Israel by deceiving the helpless Muslims of Gaza.
Barack Obama: America will use a new policy towards Iran.
According to a report from Mehr news agency, the newly elected president of America, Barack Obama told ABC news channel, in an interview with them, that they would take a new approach towards the Iran dilemma.
Barack Obama said that Iran would be a very big challenge for the American government.
He said that there is a dilemma with regard to Palestinian Islamic organizations Hamas and Hizbullah's support of Iran and Iran's nuclear enrichment program.
But he will not retain the policy of present American president George Bush with regards to Iran, but would adopt different policies for Iran.
Barack Obama said that he would make his actual goal completely clear, while stressing the hope for mutual respect and dialogue.
Barack Obama has mentioned in the past that no prerequisites will be set with regard to dialogue with Iran.
During the interview, he expressed hope that his government would make quick policy decisions on Iran.
Regarding the Middle East crisis, Obama said that he would form a special team.
It will start working on establishing peace in the Middle East from the 20th of January.
President George Bush, unable and disliked president Bush accepted his mistakes and crimes in his last press statement.
Mehr News Agency related from Associated Press that the American president George Bush, in the last press conference of his term, accepted many of his mistakes and crimes.
Speaking during the press conference at the White House, President Bush said that though newly elected president Obama has good intentions, the biggest challenge facing him would be preventing possible attacks on America.
He said that the completion of the Iraq mission and social security reforms were his mistakes.
President Bush said that whatever he did, he did it for the sake of protecting America.
Upon being asked various questions about the Israeli inflictions on Gaza, President Bush said that Israel has the right to defend itself. According to him, Hamas does not have the right to defend itself and Hamas should not do anything to Israel, and like America, the whole world should choke the oppressed rather than the oppressor.
The incapable and despicable president of the United States said that Hamas should not be given weapons either, while America is providing Israel the world's most destructive weapons. Israel is using American weapons to massacre Palestinians and Bush also praised the Israel-supporting Arabs, calling them the friends of Israel.
Bush expressed shame at some of the crimes going on in the Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo prisons.
People are opining that cases should be filed against Bush for his war crimes, and that the organizations which manage to do this will have done a great service to humanity.
Iranian President Ahmedinejad expressed sorrow over the silence of the Arab leaders.
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, the Iranian President Mahmood Ahmadinejad criticized the Arab leaders' silence on the Israeli inhumanity and oppression on Gaza, expressing his sorrow.
President Ahmadinejad said, expressing surprise over the Arab countries and their leaders' silence over the beastly acts of Israel, that Israel is subjecting the Palestinian public to a holocaust. They are making the Palestinian children, women and civilians targets of their barbarianism, and the Arab leaders have not even given one statement.
President Ahmede Nejad has called upon all the Arab countries to unite against Israel and to save the oppressed Muslims of Gaza from Israel's harm and tyranny.
Ahmade Nejad: "Saudi King should clarify his stance on the  genocide being done in Gaza by Israel."
According to the report by MAHAR/MEHR news agency, President Ahmede Nejad in his message to the Saudi King Malik Abdullah declared that the King's silence on the human genocide in Gaza and on the murder of innocent women and children is encouraging the enemies of Islam.
President Ahmede Nejad has said in his message: "You should show your true stance on Gaza and declare support for the oppressed so that the enemy's attempts to plant disagreements in the Islamic block will fail."
In his message, President Ahmede Nejad said "You know that for the last 19 days Israel has been bent upon human genocide, murdering innocent children, and subjecting homes, mosques, schools and hospitals to barbaric bombing. The Zonist Regime is brutally murdering the unarmed Muslims in Gaza. In situations like these, silence on the part of leaders like you is only encouraging Israel."
President Ahmede Nejad has told Malik Abdullah that even non- Muslim countries like Venezuela and Bolivia have taken concrete steps against Israel and that he is expected to take better steps.
President Ahmede Nejad told the Palestinians that success will be at their feet in Gaza.
The oppressed will win over the oppressors and that's Allah's promise.
President George Bush: "Terrorism is still a threat to USA."
The US President, while addressing his successor Barak Obama and the nation in his farewell speech, said that the US is safer than it was seven years ago but the threat of terrorism still looms over USA. (MEHER/MAHAR news agency, with reference from the German news agency)
Bush said that because enemy terrorists are waiting patiently to attack America and have a strong determination to do so, America should never be unaware about its security.
The American president ignored the pain and suffering of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza and defended his policies, saying that America is still the biggest supporter of Gaza's independence. However, commentators do not accept the reality of the unpopular president's remarks, as America is neither a supporter of freedom, nor a supporter of human rights, but rather is the most mischievous country in the world. Not only does it support a blood thirsty country like Israel, but it is also directly involved in its crimes.
The Israelis openly kill woman, children and other civilians. Despite this, the American president is congratulating them. This is the American humanity and freedom which the world is seeing in Gaza and other places.
Usama Hamdan: Presence of army in Palestine continues
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, Usamah Hamdan,  the Hamas leader in Lebanon, told French News Agency during an interview that a one-sided ceasefire from the Israeli side is against the comprehensive international efforts for a ceasefire. He said that as long as Israel is present in Gaza, a one-sided ceasefire is meaningless.
Hamadan said that the one sided ceasefire was an unsuccessful effort of Israel to escape defeat. He said that if Israel wants long term peace, it will have to accept Hamas's conditions as well as end this siege.
He made it clear that if Israel tries a one-sided ceasefire with its army remaining in the Gaza belt, there will be resistance.
Addressing a one-way conference from Beirut, Usamah Hamdan called for European nations to break ties with Israel.
The Hamas leader said that the increasing numbers of the martyred and injured will only increase our determination.
He also told the Palestinian public to stay firmly rooted and resist the enemy like a boulder.
Taliban have killed six people in Pakistan's tribal area of north Wazirastan.
Meher reporting agency copied with reference to Reuters that Taliban have killed 2 Afghans and 4 Pakistanis over accusation of espionage in Pakistan's tribal area of north Wazirastan.
According to reports, on Tuesday morning locals found four bodies from Tehsil Chowk in Tehsil Mir Ali, who were shot dead.
Two bodies were found thrown in the market of a bazaar in the capital of Miranshah.
Letters written in Urdu have also been found near the bodies in which it is claimed that the dead were involved in espionage.
Also, two weeks earlier, in Miranshah, capital of north Wazirastan, two Afghanis were killed over accusations of espionage.
Over the last twelve days, fifteen people have been killed over charges of espionage for America.
It should be clear that during last six years more than a hundred people have been killed in south and north Wazirastan on accusations of espionage. Taliban are accused of being involved in these murders.
Barack Obama is expected to undersign the closure orders of the infamous Guantanamo Bay prison.
Mehr Reporting Agency has cited sources that say the American president will sign off on the closure of the infamous Guantanamo Bay prison.
The new American president, Barack Husain Obama, started working on his campaign promises at the surface level.
In this regard, President Obama called for making a plan for recalling the army from Iraq, while the American president will sign an order today to close the notorious Guantanamo Bay prison.
It is expected that President Barack Obama will probably sign the order today by which the Guantanamo prison will be closed within one year.
Apart from this, the White House is expected to revise suspected terrorism investigation methods and ban ill treatment of prisoners during interrogation.
President Barack Obama started to fulfill his election campaign promises from his first day in office, and first of all started by taking steps toward making the actions and workings of the government transparent.
Experts say that the American president has started making efforts to save the declining image of America throughout the world, but that would be difficult, because as long as it will keep supporting the blood thirsty Israeli government, it can not be expected to do anything good. Therefore if America wants to save its image, it will have to stop its support of Israel and have to disassociate itself from Israel's crimes.
Tony Blair stresses the need to include Islamic organization Hamas in the talks.
Mehr news agency quoted from British newspaper The Times that former Prime Minister Tony Blair stressed the need to include Hamas in the talks to bring about peace in the Middle East.
According to the newspaper, Tony Blair said that it is important that a path be found for bringing Hamas into the Middle East peace process. Blair criticized the Bush administration for speaking only to Mahmood Abbas and ignoring Hamas. It should be clear that the western countries have realized the democratic and organizational powers of Hamas and are calling for bringing them into the talks, whereas previously they used to consider it a terrorist organization. A terrorist organization which is trying to defend its country and struggling to save its own house from the clutches of others. Whose house and country have been in the hand of the occupying Israeli government for 60 years.

Despite the military activity going on in Swat during the last one and a half years, about 150 educational institutions were destroyed by the militants by the use of explosives and arson.
Due to the destruction of these educational institutions, thousands of girls and boys were deprived of an education.

Tea: an effective cure for breast cancer
According to a new research, three cups of tea a day,
if taken, can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age, by more than a third.
In a research carried out by the Moffitt Cancer Institute, in the American state of Florida, it was revealed that the risk of occurrence of breast cancer tumors, in such women below the age of 50 years
who drink at least three cups of tea a day, is reduced by up to 37%.
It was also revealed in the research that there was no significant benefit, in these regards, in the woman aged above 50, who drank three or more cups of tea a day.
Experts believe that the reason for this is that tea has such ingredients in it, which are more effective against specific tumors which generally occur in women below the age of 50.
Research was done on 5000 women who had Breast Cancer treatment at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa,Florida.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
Specialists compared their medical records and lifestyles to those women who were free of breast cancer.
Specialists also found that tea had the most effect on one specific kind of breast cancer, Lobes.  It reduced the risk by 66%.
One on every ten breast cancer patients has this kind of cancer.
This type of breast cancer is dangerous because it is deep inside and usually only diagnosed when it has become widespread.
Specialists found that having at least three cups of tea every day can readily reduce the chances of breast cancer in women of younger ages.
They found that incorporating tea as a regular drink in your daily routine helps create immunity against the cancer.
Almost 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in Britain.
According to Gates, the war in Afghanistan is the greatest military challenge facing America

Why reduce exercise with the age?
new research
exercise at any age is good for health.
Exercise energizes your heart, reduces your cholesterol level, helps in keeping your weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer or dementia.
Unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.
experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active, however, age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.
Dr. Patricia P. Leka of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says that an increase in age is a big reason for man's decrease in exercise and physical activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.
She headed research regarding heart disease and a man's ability to do exercise in older age.
A team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of the heart.
They studied how the heart contracts and relaxes as it pumps blood.
Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is responsible for pumping blood.
They came to know that as age increases, problems increase in the relaxation action of the heart.
Dr. Patricia says with an increase in age, problems occur in the relaxation of heart and this effects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research.
He says that they were surprised to see that it has an effect, as it confirmed that poor exercising ability is closely related to the heart's relaxation phase.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.
If the doctor and the patient work together on the faults of the heart, they can achieve the benefits of excercise, despite the increase in age.
A detailed report of this has been published in the American Medical Association's magazine.
There are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief.
The chief of the Indian Army, General Deepak Kapoor has stated that there are no chances of immediate war with Pakistan. However, to serve the country and protect its interests, the Indian Army is always ready.
General Kapoor has made the accusation that despite ascertainments and the international pressure on Pakistan due to the Mumbai attacks, the terrorist's structure is not only the same in Pakistan, but it is also active.
He said this in an interview to journalists in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day trip to the Kashmir valley to inspect the situation of the overall security situation in Kashmir, which is under New Delhi's management, and to check the preparations of the armed forces at the border.
He was asked what his reaction was to the media reports which state that Pakistan refuted the proof presented by India about the Mumbai attacks.
He stated that the matters of peace and war are decided by the political leadership.
Talking about terrorism in the land of Pakistan, he allegedly said that India will fight against the forces that are trying to destroy peace and weaken India.
He said that there are around 700 to 800 fighters present in Indian Kashmir, of whom almost 50% are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that the governmental efforts of encroachment between Pakistan and Kashmir would be increased only when the weather improved, although India has increased security on the boarders.
They have refused the possibility of reducing the number of army soldiers in Indian Kashmir by stating that one can not compromise over the country's security.
May God answer the world's prayers that Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, we shall see if the relationship between America and Pakistan is affected in our favor by this change.
What will Mr. Barrack Obama give to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams?
Obama - whose middle name is Hussein - becoming president of America is historically important in many ways, and is also a great challenge.
Not only for himself but also for those who supported him with all their hearts.
It will also be challenging be for the white majority as it is not easy for them to accept that a colored man is ruling over them.
Here, South Asia, especially Muslims who have expectations from them, should remember that he has been elected as the president of America. And Obama should remember that the American president is actually the president of the entire world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th president of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have to have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, so this will be a victory for people who support him.
What will be its effect on South Asia, and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change affect the relationship between America and Pakistan?
?
Dear, whether it is Obama or someone else, the decision of the policy of the entire world is done by the Jewish lobby of  billionaires, influencing powerful people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts, the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is obvious to everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat, who had a regular Army and law.
He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a  pact.
However, it is matter of sorrow that our government treated Swat like a step-mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the termination of the government of the ruler of Swat.
There was no interest was taken in building and development works.
The girls who are getting education today are much less in number than  those who used to get educated in the previous era.
In the Frontier Province, there is a continuous targeting of educational institutions by the Taliban.
The maximum number of schools have been destroyed in district Swat in which majority are the girls schools.
In addition to this, the Taliban has imposed a ban on girls' education.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.
What do you think are the objectives of the Taliban to end females' education?
Why is the government unable to stop these unlawful acts?
What do you think the government should do?
The question is, what are the benefits for ISI and Pakistani agencies?
Now the people in S.W.A.T. can understand that the military is there to support the Taliban, not to kill them.  How is it possible that in Karfuo five schools were blown up and people were slaughter and hanged at the road?
When there is no government authority left, how can the government stop these unlawful acts?
Next the question arises that with all the advance technology, destructive weapons, and an effective spy system, why is the Taliban still not in control?
The answer is because there is a handle on their secret power.  That is why their weapons never end and they are never arrested.
The conclusion is that the Taliban, with their deeds, are making the work easier for world control.
The war in Afghanistan is going on for the past 15 years.
ISI is controlling the Taliban when at that time its opponent was the North coalition, supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly the situation changed, and the actions of the Taliban began to appear.
And ISI was also offered American dollars, so past friends became enemies.
Now the situation is that this war continues, but still helping in Pakistan are Iran, India and Russia.
Unless the feeling of what is right and wrong does not emerge in humans, then humans will keep making mistakes.
As an example, when a thief when goes to steal, if he at that time gets a thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse, there is also punishment in it and he fears from God, then that person will not steal.
Likewise, unless Israel gets this apprehension that i am doing wrong and draining blood of innocents and I will get punishment for this, he will keep playing holy with the blood innocents of Gaza until then.
Respect!
The question is whether war and terrorism are solutions to the problem?
If not, then what is the specific prescription which will solve the problem?
This war is not right. It is destructive and increase our problems rather than solve it.
Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq should adopt these models in order to get their Independence, much like how Nelson Mandela freed his beloved country.
to fight more for socially and ethically, rather than with arms.
kashmiri's participation in election shows that they have accepted his point.
Israeli attacks have gone on for 3 weeks and the death toll have reached 1000.
world diplomacy efforts have not resulted in cease fire until now.
an according to a survey , after the dec. 27 attacks, 90,000 Palestine left their homes and moved to a safer place.
on the other hand, NGOs has accused Israel for not taking care of Palestinian children and added that these children will have serious phsycological and emotional problems.
What have you to say??
what do you think should to be done?
how is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

The Taliban should be given a chance.
Basit, Peshawar
Please wake up: If the Taliban starts doing the real Jihad, then who will kill the innocent people?
Who will burn down the girls' schools?
Who will kidnap for ransom, or if ransom not paid then accuse people of being American agents and hang them on the towers?
These Taliban have brought such damage to Islam that no other nation or religion has ever brought.

Kohat, Pakistan
If the whole Muslim world just gave a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see how upset will father America will be.
And immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well.
But what can be done? Where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from?
Someone tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step, as he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
The responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on Arab and the Muslim worlds but its the obligation of the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny.
This unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
Just like in Pakistan and India before 30th June or the end of the fiscal year, the government institutions are looted, the American regime just before its end have given a green signal to Israel to do what ever it wants.
On one hand America says that effort will be made for ceasefire.
On the other hand, the United Nations is passing resolution after resolution, but action-wise, has done nothing. There is only one meaning of this, and that is that the even the United Nations is openly in favor of destroying the Muslims.
All Muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the United Nations, and should establish their own global organization.
We have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations are seen, but the harm is only done to the Muslims.
What is the use of these vain efforts if BBC does not want to publish anything?
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically of Muslims, is spilled, the monster of unbiasedness gets onto BBC's back.
It considers itself the standard bearer of truth.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments from Muslims.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments from Muslims.
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, and the likes of you stay among Muslims, and call yourselves Muslims.
[syja786]
Long time since, in the forums of BBC, a specific cult has been targeted, sometimes in suicide attacks, and sometimes in terrorism happening in India.
Extremism is the favorite word for those anti-Islamic comments.
But by viewing the above comment, you can easily diffrentiate who is the actual extremist, in which almost a Fatwa of blasphemy has been pronounced for writing against Iran.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal can't be fought with the help of sword.
After watching Israel's bombings on unarmed people, what would one's tear-filled heart do?
But the actual blame should go to that terrorism and violence, which we state as Jihad and ruin the beautiful name of Islam.
Since the majority of Palestinians have already accepted the existence of Israel, does it make sense for Hamas to fire rockets on Israel or do suicide attacks?
Behavior from both sides lacks humanity.
The character played by America, and United Nations again showed us their support for the cruelties of Israel.
May ALLAH grant us, the Muslims, a way to re-unite. Ameen.
As a matter of fact, think about giving Noble Prize to terrorists. In carrying out this painful terrorist activity, the actual work is being done by them. It is s a campaign against terrorism.
Otherwise, is it possible to carryout terrorist activity on such a massive scale without the assistance of Chiefs and  every one knows who are pulling their strings.
In such a situation it can be termed as high handedness "Do what ever you can".
The strong mans fist, it beats over the head and do not let one cry.
The Arab rulers are giving out medicine for the injured, Funeral clothing's for the dead and money. They are asking
Should the Israelis continue attacks?
The actual problem is that the rulers of Islamic countries including Saudi Arabia are dreaming, undutiful, and unaware. They have neither the army nor defense plans. They just think that by providing aid they have fulfilled their duty.
They should immediately take practical steps against Israel.
like cutting off oil supply to European countries and America, but they feel sorry for them.
Regards to all brothers and sisters.
i think at this hard time advising hammas to stop struggling in the name of peace would be injustified with thousands of widows and millions of orphans, and it would be similar to prove them wrong.
If israel and its followers are at peak of cruelty then soon a revolution to stop all this is going to show up because this is the law of nature. America and isreal's steps are upbringing suicide bombers.
They can can not understand who are blind in trance of power.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Now Hammas and Israel should befriended to stop blood shed.
Muhammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France.
very rightly said.
Assumingly if hammas is 100% right and by fighting against malice it gets higher place in the eyes of God even then atleast they should realize if by good deeds peace of others home is shattered then that act is no longer a good deed.
Those who claim to love God, His Prophet(P.B.U.H) and their religion, to love humanity is part of their belief.
Consequently after Muslim's confiscation of everybody on earth is Allah's order.
Najeeb-ur-Rahman Psycho *Lahore* [Pakian]
No! It is not decreed to annihilate, but it is decreed to invite people to Islam.
But for people who conspire against the religion, it is decreed to do Jihad against them.
One should fight with them until they finish their conspiracies. But this certainly does not mean that they are given permission to wear a jacket that hides bombs and blow up a crowd.
Brothers, a murderer of children faces dire consequences.
But I say to my friends that yesterday Israelis did not have a roof over their heads and today they are so strong that they do not listen to anyone because all Jews are one.
They do not have Shiite nor Sunni, all are just Jews, and so they have succeeded in every field.
Contrary to this, what is the condition of 55 Islamic Countries?
They are lagging in every field, and now the condition is such that they are so helpless that enemies are killing them and they are waiting for their death.
The point is that all Muslim countries should get together and should make a plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
There is no better course of action then accepting Israel progress.  It is best to Learn new technologies and ways to be success and let the world live in peace.
Muslims also have great properties and resources.
They need to learn how to capitalize on their resources..
One of the Muslim people's greatest problems is that the Hammas and Alfatah can not be united.
The only reason to destroy great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin was to weaken the only nation fighting for Aqsa Mosque. And it was impossible until Yasir and Yasin were removed from the way.
The world has seen how Palestine was effected after the death of these two leaders.
Now the jews are able to strengthen their positions in the land with every passing minute.
In 1974, a Pakistani Prime minister had such influence that he was able to assemble all of the Muslim leaders under one roof.  These leaders were so united that for the first time in history they obtained 100% attendance.
Today, on his 81st birthday, The country can not even come together to decide weather it even wants to unite as one!
Will the incomplete mission of forming a joint Islamic nation will be advanced while still removing the differences between the Muslims?
This is a Jinn, which has been inside Palestine for half a century.
That Jinn has many different opinions.
Often this Jinn calls itself bad names from one of its other mouths to divert the attention and reduce the pressure put on it by other governments.
It is another mouth of this Jinn which is causing the unrest in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This Jinn fears Islam the most because it knows that whenever it is removed, only Islam, Mulsims, and the complete religion of Islam in its followers can remove it, as history proves that Islam has brought many Abu Jahls into practice.
The series of bombings of Gaza by Israeli war planes and missile strikes has been going on since the 27th of December.
More than three hundred Israeli citizens have died so far in these attacks.
Now, after the air strikes, Israeli tanks have reached the Gaza border in preparation for a land offensive.
The Security Council of the United Nations, through an agreed  resolution passed in an emergency meeting, have demanded that Israeli and Palestinian authorities stop extremist activities immediately.
However, Israeli officials claim that they will continue their actions in Gaza, until they are convinced that Israel will be safe from rocket attacks.
In your opinion, is the statement by Israel, that this is an Israeli struggle for safety acceptable?
In this situation, is the global brotherhood doing its' job?
Can this inhumane action have a direct relationship with the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can there be any expectation of improvement, in the Middle East, after newly elected president Barack Obama takes office?

Palestine is a holy land for Muslims all over the world, and protecting it is a necessary duty for all of us.
Also, we should remember that it was our first Qiblah.
Israel, America, and India have to disappear one day, having been made only to be destroyed, and Allah will definitely destroy the disbelievers. Sajid Sadiq, Lahore.

"When has the night of loneliness been spent shedding tears, when has a calamity been averted only by supplication." (Nawab Zadah Nasrullah Khan)
BBC searches for such comments and publishes them.
After all it has to keep up the flag and perception of non-alignment.
As such, the news on BBC is usually true, but the main thing is the tone.
Which thing should be highlighted and which piece of news should be given less importance?
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
In this practice, our Pakistani Wire-net media, in particular some columnists and newspapers are not far behind any more, as they are writing with courage against the growing extremism and terrorism and stressing a lot upon "Muawiyah hate".
He said that the United Nations speaks of human rights and peace, but though the Muslims ar being oppressed greatly, you hear them say that until Hamas does not stop its attacks, this unfair policy will continue.
Why there is so much atrocity committed on Muslims. If people like Americans are backing up the Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So, Americans, if you have courage then stop supporting them and see then what their fate is.
So-called writers and murderers in name of peace should understand that peace in the world can only be obtained through justice not through genocide.
If any nations perish through genocide and results of choice can be obtained then after actions of Hitler, existence of Jews and their uprising was impossible.
As poet says.
Atrocity is atrocity, it vanishes when it rises.
Blood is blood, clots when drop.
Now who will tell whom what is terrorism?
Is this comes in terrorism, why? because own pain is only felt.
Other people are not humans or blood of Muslims is so cheap or color of these innocents' blood was not red?
And now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere?
I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.
I can not find the words that are strong enough to condemn the actions that resulted in the dead bodies on the road, and the helpless, injured, and innocent faces soaked in blood.
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims in this situation.  On the one hand, because of the killing in India the rest of the world comes over to Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations that we would normally do on our own.
On the other hand, Israel is killing generations of muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent.  This is unbearable!
There is delay but NEVER in the house of God and only then will this darkness be shed. Then
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Elections are important for securing the people's support, especially in countries like Israel, and rulers should continue to hold them.  However, history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy so Barrack Obama likely won't either.  Regime, whether black or white, is still a regime.
From the debates in the forum it is evident that everyone is sad about Benazir's death, however we can not ignore her political mistakes.
There's room for debate about whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was so dear then why did it take American involvement to end Musharaf's ten year dictatorship?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the public needed her. Unfortunately, she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised.
When each and every historic personality is being accused, there is no one to say anything about this.

Few things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done about them.

Sir, probably you should not only study Pakistan's history but that of 4 friends and 7 other countries. Maybe you would agree with Psycho's point of view.

"Those who don't have a good nature can't be corrected through training."
Living green in the water made the reflection of the wheat plant look like a cypress.
Britain never let them unite and established the Hindu-Muslim conflict which was later on brought up by Sir Syed.

How bloody is our nation and in our party's excitement while writing the Epode they will be blind. But now every historic people is trying to pinpoint an accusation and criticize the judiciary, but on this noone is telling anything.
We have achieved a lot of success.

Few things can be avoided by thinking that nothing can be done. This is the same as if we put books on donkey -- he will not become a professor.
If after the attack on Mumbai there is a problem between Pakistan and India, they still have to continue their regular activities.
If we talk about war then on both sides there will be a loss of human life.
India is saying that the person arrested at the time of the Mumbai attack is a Pakistan citizen and he has written a letter in Urdu and sent it to Pakistan. But India has said after arresting him that he is an engineer, but after that they have proved that he is just a fourth standard pass, a point to be observed.
First of all, to Mr. Bhana and all Western friends of this forum, a happy Christmas.
Colleagues of the forum: Mr psycho, a raza, sister sana, sister shahedah akram and to all Adaab (salaam, greeting)
We want flowers of peace rather than the flame of war.
War is itself a problem.
What solution will the war give?
Today will give fire and blood.
Tomorrow will give hunger and necessity.
For this wise people
It is better that war is postponed.
In our garden it is better that candle stays lit.
In our garden it is better that candle stays lit.
The relationship of India and America has become deep and India knows that when the time comes America will openly deceive Pakistan.
This is the history of America.
In the case of an Indian attack, America's goals will be fulfilled, and the expenses will be India's.
Pakistan should clearly announce that it will not start a conflict, but if a conflict is caused, there will be no talks of peace or truce. The war will not stop until India is completely destroyed or captured, even if it involves our own destruction.
This is Islamic history.
Before the resolution, the message that had to be given by the public and the army was released.
In compensation for the Mumbai attacks, the abnormal diplomatic and military benefits that India tried to gain, made it more a victimizing party, than a victim. That is why, in contrast to the harsh initial global reactions, the world has now reduced their force on Pakistan.
The satisfaction expressed by the United Nations over Pakistani efforts and the praise by the Interpol leader of Pakistani efforts, in disregard of India's commotion, shows the side effect of India's more than necessary diplomacy.
There is no argument about the brutality of these actions.
But the question is, when thousands of Taliban were attacking Pir Samiullah's town, where were the Pakistani Army, and what were they doing?
Should the army not be taken into account, for what they did there in a year?
How many Taliban die each day due to their firing of thousands of mortar and canon shells?
I appeal to the ICI that they stop their guardianship of the Taliban, for God's sake, and let us live peacefully in paradise like Swat,
and that they stop this fixed operation.
The day is not far when a resolution will be passed in the United Nations against army intervention in Pakistan, the same way as it was passed against Jama'athud-Da'wah.
Riyaz Ahmad Farooqi
First of all, our radicalism and our protecting them, is alone, sufficient to provide complete proof and permissibility for action against us. And the very day such a resolution is passed, there is all probability that no voice will be raised in our support, in the United Nations.
And supposing the passing of such a resolution is delayed, some other strength will definitely leave our aid to ourself,, keeping the example of America in front of them.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
The bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah, and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are eternal even after death.
But here an international game is being played. Here ferocity and animosity are created to do the ruling.
So there can be reason created that if we are not here then these vandals and animals can come take over the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so-called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
America sees the torture of these extremists but instead of being sad about these faithless activities, they easily call them "tribal culture".
The reason for these faithless activities, sometimes given in the name of tribal culture and other times in the name of Islam, is not something done by a person with a heart.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so brave that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also men of God and so is our army.
It is clear that something is sinister.
Malaiyat. Ziya-ul-Haqq's dictatorship, instead of presenting the noble and merciful characters of God, an atmosphere of religion-phobia was created by the use of many types of narrations of punishments and incidents apart from the incident of the body hanging. Even the literature and books asking "what will happen when we die?" created fear and terror.
And these people are only using this fear as a tool or a weapon to gain worldly pleasures and honor.
Preachers!
As you have preached against the fire of Hell that you have yourself become the face of fear.
As you have preached against the fire of Hell that you have yourself become the face of fear.
It is surprising when it is said that this cannot be the work of a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our own history, or we ignore it for some reason.
Upon the death of the Prophet, upon refusing to pledge alliegance, who burned the door of the daughter of the Messenger and pulled her husband out with a rope around his neck?
Had they come from somewhere outside?
Was the attack on Medina by the Army of Yazid, and the incident of Karbala the conspiracy of Jews and Pagans?
Without accepting the facts, neither motives can be removed nor can they be corrected.
BBC people, stop this dual policy.
A better super hit title than this is:  The Beating  of Bush with Shoes: Right or Wrong?
This should have been the topic.
Tahir Chowdary, Japan
Be ashamed, the body of a person was taken out of the grave and hanged on a pole because he spoke against the cruelty and you are struck up over the topic of Box Office.
The success of operation Sherdil, and across the border the success of operation Lion Heart depends on the direction of sympathies of common folk.
This step of American and Pakistani intelligence agencies and Pir Sahib is the victim of this conspiracy.
All the comments on this forum would be against the Taliban because intelligence agents have successfully infiltrated in the Taliban ranks and they are carrying out such actions that can change their perception of people.
I only want to ask, when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public? They even report something like this: "Bombing of Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother".
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000 in Swat went there to do.
The bodies of the Taliban who help the army are left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake, stop this drama.
The Talibans have tarnished the Muslim image.
If true Muslims from all over the world don't call these terrorists Muslims, then how are these elements able to live in the lands of true Muslims?
Those who become shameless, can't do hard labor.  They pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or the barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
No religion or family traditions allow this.
Including BBC, all the media present their views in different styles on Taliban or the tribal people.
No one is aware of the ground realities or what the truth is. It is us, the tribal people, who know what the problem is.
In short, it's a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a Talib or a Tribal. Who made these institutions? Warmongers who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions.
This move has shamed all the Muslims.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is the Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that current leadership will end this  cancer.
After the Mumbai attacks, India said that some extremists were behind the attacks.
Pakistan, rejecting the accusations, said that it will help India's investigation in every possible way.
India said that it has given a list to Pakistan of 20 suspected extremists wanted by India.
Now Pakistan has said that included in the list is Jaish-e-Muhammad's Molana Azhar Masood, who is not in custody and about whom the government of Pakistan has no information.
Before that Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari refuted the view that the West's secret agencies and the Indian government has given evidence related to the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari has said that it has not been proven that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that its relations with India are not going to improve until its land is ceased to be used for terrorism.
In latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should sports be effected due to recent political events?
What future to you see for India-Pakistan relations?
Neither America nor India broke Pakistan.
Pakistan was broken by the Pakistanis themselves.
What else could be expected after such regionalism, communalism and vandalism.
Even Jinnah did not do good for the Muslims of India. Time has proved this.
Yasmin, Chicago
If we had kept working on the vision of Jinnah, destroying the cancer of communalism, then regionalism and vandalism would not have spread in Pakistan, and the Muslims of India would not have been treated poorly.
But it is our own fault that we couldnt produce a leader of similar stature.
If we can't respect our leaders then
There are many worthy people in this part of the world.
God knows when some sense will return to the people and when the blessing of Consensus in opinion will help improve this area.
In both countries the Mullahs, Pundits, Taliban, Shiv Sena, the RSS, etc have been established to oppose the progression of peace.
Destructive forces don't want this area to improve, and for this, these countries are manipulated like puppets.
Can you imagine, with the aid of Consensus between Pakistan, India, and China, what position they would have in the world?
It is Gods' punishment that positioned thieves, robbers, and manipulators as leaders of this country.
May God protect Pakistan from any harm, Amen.
But sir, open your eyes and look around. See the current situation and ground realities that reveal the extent to which the American have progressed.
Besides, the situation in the country doesnt seem to be stable (like in the NWFP, Baluchistan and Sindh) and the problems in Karachi are also evident.
In this atmosphere we need a leader capable of uniting the people of this country.
Oh God, please show us some mercy!
I believe we must go to war one last time. That is our only option.
Enough is enough!
It's now or never!
These fraudulent dialogues and pointless meetings are not the solution to the problems!
Neither is committing small scale terrorist acts against each other's territories!
After all, it was only after entering World War II that Europe found a way to sort out its problems.
And if it wasn't for this World War, the nations involved would still be arguing and nagging each other over small things.
Almost all of our political parties are unified to the topic that terrorism and sectarian violence, shall be eradicated from the country.
But our own military leadership does not seem to be sincere on this topic. At one side, Europe and America are assured that the military is sincere in achieving a terror free state. But, on the other hand, they help the Taliban in disguise.
Now we have to think and define our path and select one path to focus on, Thank you.
There is no doubt that the elements of Jamat-ud-dawa include majority of those people who belong to Lashkar-e-Taiba, which is a banned organization, is now established and operating with a new name Jamat-ud-dawa Pakistan.
However, after that, more focus was diverted towards humanitarian activities and now on India's strong request.  The United Nations has also banned it and the government of Pakistan has also implemented a crack down on this organization.
In my opinion if these Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and get focused towards religion and humanitarian assistance, then it is much better.
The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan which have used the name of Jihad to induct and nurture professional killers, criminals and their molana's, are the same people who called Pakistan 'Plaeedistan' meaning un clean land. These are the people who make a bad name for Pakistan.
Now, they are trying their best to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they don't even get close to being called a Muslim.  In fact, they deserve to be called animals or barbarians
Pakistan security will stay at risk until these extremists are eradicated from Pakistan.
Can we still afford to wonder whether we should ban these mutinous people or not?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose work is only to kill.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What kind of world is this where it is hard to live for one who takes the name of one major pillar of Islam,  religion of Allah.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims but when Muslims even try to take revenge, all our hypocrite leaders together with all the non-Muslim world treat people with the true and right pain of religion just like our great leader Hafiz Saeed is being treated today.
India in impunity of Bombay attacks.
Pakistan relations are bitter. The better relationship as a result of last few years between the two countries have been jolted greatly.
India has always held the military and non-military groups in Pakistan responsible.
And putting the relationship back on track is being conditioned by operations against these groups.
Indian security departments have held Lashkher-e-Tayyaba responsible for the Bombay attacks.
In this case, the name of Jamat-ud-Dawa has come to the forefront many times.
This is the first time that relationship between both the countries has worsened due to terrorist activity in India.
In December 2001, after the attacks on the Indian Parliament, these two neighbors were on the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
Now it is about Jamat-ud-Dawa, which Security analysts say that is in reality a new face of Lashker-e-Tayyaba. Restrictions on the party are being requested.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan conduct decisive operations against extreme activists on its land?
By banning Jamat-ud-Dawa, can  the current Pak-India crisis be brought to a close?
And how important is it to close down the armed groups to keep constant peace between both countries?
The Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all, what proof does the Security Council have to decide this so quickly?
Does the Security Council always show urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful country.
Whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours? India. And they want to put the blame for it's inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis, continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Do greet them sir. But at your own expense.
Don't do it under the pressure of America.
If India has any complaints, then it should come up with evidence.
Why don't they do so?
Why do they blame everything on us?
Extremist groups are also present in India, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the world?
How can India explain its actions in Kashmir?
And what of the actions of Israel?
The truth is that we are the first nuclear Islamic state in the world and that is the cause of all the hatred.
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart.
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be part of this conspiracy.
American are not slowly but now very swiftly tightening their grip on Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances, if we as a nation dos not display unity and solidarity, then if Bangladesh can be created, anything can happen.
Terrorism is condemned, whether it is in a hotel in Mumbai or in a Marriott Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine.
Likewise, regardless of the origin of the terrorists, they should be eliminated, whether they are Pakistani or Indian or American or Israeli.
Now the question is that why the whole world, including Pakistani officials, are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack carried out on the Marriott Hotel not a terrorist attack?
Then why?
Praise the worthy Advisor interior,Mister Rehman Malik,by the grace of God, how brave he has become!

Not only this , according to the BBC Mister Malik has also tried to negate this impression with full strength that all these imprisonments are being carried out on whose orders.
Praise the lord!
Having this capability or not, this I don't want to say.
Whose war we Pakistanis are fighting
and why. We have our own priorities which we shall protect with our full strength.
Nobody has an authority to interfere in any other country.
Apparently colonial period does not seem to exist.
If people expect justice, demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan. I do not believe this is acceptable by those calling for unity.
As such, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
And this causes more feelings of opposition.
If they trust America and the United republics, then let them leave the style of new populations, and let them work on those lines, upholding the sovereignty of the state.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
In Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, security forces captured a proved camp of practically non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India's accusation is that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice told the Pakistani leadership that there should be immediate action taken against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack.
It is their claim that without a doubt, the extremists who carried out the Mumbai attacks used Pakistani land.
Meanwhile, officials in Peshawar claim that the lot of trucks which carry supplies to the united forces in Afghanistan was burned by unidentified armed people, because of which more than 50 trucks were destroyed.
This is the second attack in Peshawar on NATO and American supplies in the last 48 hours.
Meanwhile, Pakistan captured an established camp of the almost non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba. Previously, lots of efforts were carried out to try to disarm groups all the way from Karachi to the tribal regions, which included giving compensation to those who returned their weapons and even assuring them that no action would be taken against them.
The situation is telling us that the efforts undertaken in the regime of General Ziyaul Haqq, after the previous Soviet Union's interference in Afghanistan to get rid of the armed groups that formed as a result of the resistance that started through American and Saudi funding, and to bring an environment similar to that before 1980 were not successful.
The question is what does Pakistan want to do?
Does Pakistan have the ability to do so?
What do you say?

I have only one question for the standard bearers of the world.
If you kill their children, will they come to give you garlands? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill innocent people, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in negative, then you really need to fix your viewpoint.
The people were armed when there was the fear that Russia would head towards Pakistan after finishing Afghanistan, and that is why they were supplied with arms.
Now, when there is the fear that America will capture Pakistan, via Afghanistan, as the present American president has clearly mentioned in his presidential mission, why should we disarm them now?
Only such that after defeating the American or Indian army it does not have to face any resistance from the public?
Yes, if any of them are guilty of being involved in any destructive work, Pakistan can take action against them alone.
but this is morn, that government against Lashkaray Taiba  that prove right India that Pakistan involve in that.
Najeeb Ul Rehman Saico, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
If we accept that Laskaray Taiba is involved, it is still wrong to blame the Pakistani government.
And one question is also that this terrorist have a either get support of any Government or Indian government personal?
Is a terrorist only born and made in Pakistan and not made in India and rest of the countries?
as far as Laskaray Taiba has concerned they did not involve to this recent terror.
Remember that Hafiz Saeed was the first person who called Taliban acts as "Fitnah".
It is my firm belief that Taliban acts were a part of American projects so that every that person and group need to clean out from the way who challenge Taliban in any manner.
ven support by a whole nation, take action against Lashkar due to Indian pressure indicate Zardindco frustration and butter up nature.
America said to end this campagin which start from Saudi's funding ask them godly now clean this dirt as well, which make our society polluted.
America and Saudi spread in our country dangerous weapons and so-called "Jihadi", which is in reality hate-inciting and cultural virus enticing literature. Our country has become a human slaughterhouse because of this.
Due to the risk of attack from India, The Pakistani Army's announcement that it would remove forces from the Afghan border and post them at the Indian border, and the Taliban's announcement that it would handle the Afghan border caused America to stumble and pressure India not to attack Pakistan.
This showed the strength of America in the region.
Though India did not warn that they would attack, nor do they have that much courage.
The Taliban attacked and finished most of the remaining American supplies.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and tha Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi is the trade and financial center of Pakistan, and the Dubai of the backward regions.
Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty handed, but ever since the law and order situation in the western border regions was lost, all people diverted their attention here.
Now they want to kidnap this city.
Pathans are now called Pukhtons, made foreigners, and forced to fight, while the need in Pakistan is for unity.
One possible solution to the problem is this that either Urdu speaking learn Peshto or Peshto speaking learn Urdu, or what's better is they all learn English.
You will surely think this as a ridiculous suggestion but do you think that the reason for this conflict is not ridiculous?
The reason of violence is language.
Zaheer Chughtai.
Sir I gave this suggestion through childhood to my friends in which there were people according to classification from every religion and dialect but friends used to laugh on me talks.
At that time the condition of Jinna of hatred of dialectal and religious was not that alive and strong but it was brewing internally.
Do not understand what it is and why is it happening?
Are these the very same signs of the Last day?
For what crime are innocent and guiltless being killed?
The reasons are in front of everyone who wants to divide Pakistan in pieces some are active here. The ones who do this neither have religion nor country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns
Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir mean that is what is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
At the height of the Mumbai attacks, efforts to cause mischief on linguistic and racial lines in Karachi failed, which is proof that those politicians working on racial parole have resigned from their jobs.
The taking of the lives of innocent Pushtu speaking laborers, and the Indian warnings have awakened the sleeping Pakistani feelings from Karachi to Khyber.
The identical country loving reaction of all the political, religious, linguistic and national parties has not only taught India the manners of diplomacy, but it has also given the American policy makers a chance to think again.
The responsible parties for the worsening situation in Karachi are the United and the ANP. The government is taking sides.
The government can control the situation in one hour, but it is purposely allowing it to grow.
The police and rangers are avoiding action because of the pressure on them by the political parties.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
These kinds of incidents will keep taking place until there is pressure on the administration.
I think that these people are the biggest terrorists.
Foreign powers are definitely involved in this, but no one knows who they are.
But alas, that if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there, but since its not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
The government should operate here and save one of this country's largest and most important cities from terrorism
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
Also, BBC Urdu is not writing the truth under pressure-- Pakistani media's condition is already weak.
The whole truth is there on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that either Urdu speakers should learn Pushto or Pushto speaking learn Urdu. The best solution would be if every body could learn English.
You will definitely take this as a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
Was language the reason for violence?
There was another terrorist attack reported from Karachi, the repercussions of which will be felt by every citizen for a long time.
It seems that wherever possible, they did as much damage as possible.  The media is reporting only half of what has happened in the last four days.
I've been awake for four nights and I'm still afraid.
They've evacuated hotels.  Cobblers and peanut sellers have been killed.
Those who destroyed the highway and are cutting of the ears of civilians are not aware of the punishment of Allah, who will come down on them some day.
In your opinion, what are the reasons for this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
If you look at the attacks in Bombay, you don't have to look far to find the reason for this distrubance in Karachi.  But there is one simple reason.  This attack was the result of wanton bloodlust.
It is evident that if some one will knock kneed with the father, it is not unusual for the son to get out of control.
The blood of Liyaqath Ali Khan and many other brave hearts was also from there. I am writing this poem to get rid of Saiko's misunderstanding.
We will also repeat the traditions of the elders.
They gave their lives to build, we will give our lives to save.
Faizan Touseef Siddiqi
It is very sad that we are fighting each other at a time when the whole country is under attack.
I tell Mr. Siddiqi that if he checks Wikipedia.org for Liyaqath Ali Khan, then he will know that he was from a repectable Punjabi family, in the Karnal region of Punjab district.
I tell Mr. Siddiqi that if he checks Wikipedia.org for Liyaqath Ali Khan, then he will know that he was from a repectable Punjabi family, in the Karnal region of Punjab district.
Because of his efforts for immigrants, today the immigrants call him on of their own.
Every action has a reaction.
One can bear one's self, but...
Ejaz Aiwan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are funding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating these kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan, they did not face any actions.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
One Muslim League N was left, even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q have made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment in the National Assembly and the Senate.
Till now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why  no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part that is they will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft, although the government speaker did not take any action.
MQM coalition partner of government, Muslim League N an underhand ally of government and Muslim league Q the party to approve the seventeenth amendment then how is it possible that these parties can be sincere to approve the disapprove amendment.
It's just like writing your name amongst shaheeds by just putting color on yourself.
The Peoples Party, at any rate, is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment.
How would one think of getting his own hands cut?
As long as Zardari is the president, the seventeenth amendment is not going to be repealed.
This is the opinion of a majority in our survey and so is the truth.
If the seventeenth amendment was to be repealed then Zardari would never have become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Musharaf as along with being the president he is also the chairman of the Peoples Party.
As long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.
In order to cancel the seventeenth amendment, the political parties will first have to dismiss President Zardari from the presidency.
Neither MQM nor the other parties want this.
Most of the elders from our family belonged to the labor community.
In our childhood when we used to see our uncles doing labor, we used to pray to Allah: Please save us from this hard labor.
To avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what we should do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor.
The editor wrote in reply that we should select certain subjects and become doctors or engineers.
Right from beginning my trend was toward engineering and I had selected technical drawing instead of biology as well.
But at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor.
I studied biology for hardly a month and then when nothing worked out, I took math as an alternate subject.
Fear of labor made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.
I remembered that when I along with my two sons were trying to remove the carpets from our old house.
It had been not even half an hour that we were working when the small son said, "Daddy, it seems that I am not born for this job."
We said, if so, study well like us and build up your body.
The son started saying, "I am studying already, will be studying more, but this work is not done by me."
Any we three managed to complete the work within three hours and returned home.
The meaning of saying this is that if a man decides on one destiny then whatever comes afterward will not stop him from accomplishing his destiny.
Yes, and if you don't really know what you have to do, then Allah is the only protector for you.
There is a saying that we should never speak ill of the dead, but what to do, when at the first anniversary of Benazir's death, we only see bad in her.
Benazir for her own benefit forwarded to India the Sikhs' army, who were to fight the war of independence. On one side the independent movement of the Sikhs was collapsed and on the other side gave an opportunity for India to concentrate on Kashmir after pushing down the Punjab movement.
It is part of the distraction from the leadership of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif which have pushed the country many years backwards.
During exile, Benazir continued on keeping the series beneficiary information of Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir Bhutto struck a deal with Musharraf, going against her London Treaty with Nawaz Sharif.
Benazir allowed her husband to openly earn money in her era, which is why he came to be known as Mr. Ten Percent.
In Benazir's era, her brother was killed, and his killer has still not been punished.
Despite being a woman, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
In a way similar to how Benazir conducted politics over her father's dead body, her widower is now conducting politics over her dead body.
Benazir came to power twice, but has not been able to bring the people guilty of the political killing of her father to justice, let alone file a case against them.
It has been 37 years since East Pakistan was separated from us, and look at the height of insensitivity on the part of the public and the rulers, that no one ever mourned or expressed sorrow over their mistakes.
We should have been observing December 16 as a day of reflection and making plans to prevent the reoccurrence of such incidents.
We should have been sending greetings to the people of Bangladesh on this day and been trying to bring them closer to ourselves.
The ruler should have opened the Jamudur Rahman commission file and pondered over the causes of separation of West Pakistan, mentioned therein.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Bahari's stuck in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines.
If only East and West Pakistan could be one together just like East and West Germany was united once again.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be granted in the near future.
It was announced today that the governor of Illinois was arrested on corruption charges.
When the state Congress started getting ready to remove him from the position of the governor as soon as possible, then there is this one American companion who has a close watch on the circumstances of Pakistan, boastfully claimed to us that this is what we call democracy.
In America, even the higher level people can not transcend the law.
And there is your country, whose President was made after he had the corruption charges dropped.
We felt our nerve of wit and said, "what if a governor was arrested in America?  In our Pakistan our Prime Minister was once arrested during the night and was hanged.
Tell me if anything like this has happened in America.
Pakistan awarded Guard of Honor and bid farewell from the President's house, who broke the law of the country. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America.
Chief Justice of Pakistan was laid off in such a way that even after the nations support, he has not yet been reinstated. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America.
In Pakistan, a fake degree holder was appointed as Health Minister. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America.
After listening to this, the poor American could not stop laughing and also accepted defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by Americans from all sides.
It seems from his smile
America is with his government. But he is forgetting that last year, the same people were with Parvez Musharaf.
Thus psychotherapy gained popularity.
Whether there is madness in method or method in madness, there is certainly a method in dealing with madness.
That said, mental health care has come a long way from merely addressing dementia to dealing with problems such as stress, depression, anxiety and relationship problems.
She finished her MA in counseling psychology from Columbia University.
The center offers support services for depression, anxiety, stress, learning problems, and personality deficiencies.
Material problems and workplace issues.
It also offers employee assistance programs for corporations.
There are enough opportunities in the fields of counseling and psychotherapy.
Traditionally both roles were played by psychiatrists, who counseled patients.
Research has revealed that there are conditions which can be cured without medication.
The government must, instead of using the power, eliminate the causes of the issue.
by eliminating the causes, Fazlullah and Taliban will automatically disperse.
the Sharia bill proposed by ANP will, to a great extent, become the solution of the problems of Swat.
But besides implementation of the Sharia, the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues.
At the beginning of General Musharaf rise, it looked like the nation had rid itself of the incompetent politicians, but the lust for power changed all his plans.
all the hopes were from the participation in the "War of terror", he had started considering himself immortal.
those steps which were expected, all broke-off.
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, made a deal with the thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army but never know what wass happening to the present government.
Either its Bajor or Swat, the army does not control terror but bombs the ""Enemy"" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy a mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy.
The conditions in the  terrorist stricken area Swat, in the Frontier Province, are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area.
On the one side, the governments rights in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly. On the other side, the effect of Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everday in Swat.
On the third side, the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
The security forces claimed to have killed many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment, but in spite of these killings the Taliban has not only gained strength, but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.
The result is that on the one hand the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other, the Taliban has established its' hold.
And the poor citizens of Swat are stuck in between.
When a citizen of Swat was asked, "what kind of people are theTaliban?" The answer was  "Very good people, because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country."
When asked how is the Army,  the answer was that the Army is very good, since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.
Then it was asked, who are the enemies of religion and country, the answer was "the citizens"
I am astonished, how the Pakistani Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban's.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
But still, the FM channel is spreading poison with vigor.
First the girls' schools and now boys' schools are being destroyed.
Curfews are called so that the Taliban can move around easily.
During curfew tonight, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
The question arises as to how they got there despite the curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone convince the army to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the army can defeat any enemy.
You say that mostly blood is spilled in the world because of religion. Tell me, if there was no religion today, would all this killing not take place?
Are Punjabi, Pathan, White, Black, Mahsood and other tribes the result of religion?
No, sir, no way! Only religion teaches that there is no black and white, there is no Punjabi and no immigrant. If it were not for religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between the white and the black, and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribe-brotherhood hatred.
Actually, only religion trains man's character and restricts him, as he has not come here on his own will, but rather the Creator of all that exists sent him here, and he must live here according to His commands.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France, for two years, I also felt the same way.
I do not know why people only expect us to call.
A resolution about Iraq, passed in a few hours, to send a "peace" force to Darfur is not at all a problem.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where there is a matter of death, we are still holding meetings about that.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
Is it for real that every one is waiting for it to end?
So that no other victim will even think about using a great damage causing weapon like a gun to fight for his rights?
Doesn't your heart ache whenever a father runs holding his son's dead body?
If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
But you are a shame to humanity.
At least it was proven that this area was Israel's country for thousands of years.
What should happen is that both the nations should live together happily and with love. But since they are controlled by either west or arab countries,  peace therefore,  cannot be formed here without their consent.
But even Iran wants to fight its proxy war right now.
Even if operations in Israel are halted for the time being, they will start again after another incident.
The interest of BBC's country is subject to the bestowing of America and Israel. And this is the reason why in the name of ""enlightenment"", they have come with a series of blogs based on ""darkness"" and doing one-way and a blind propaganda.
The BBC is completing a formality. Their goal and intent is only to gather well wishes.
I request the moderator to publish this comment from Fidwi: "So it be known that at least a little bit of affinity towards truth is still remaining in BBC".
Thank You.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to be known. But one thing is for sure, in every age, Dracula  has been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
This 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre is a surprise.
How could any one not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
What kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to any one coming in the next century ?
Well wisher, Sajjad, Alhasnain, Hyderabad, and Deccan
At this time, summer showers are taking place throughout the country, including Derah, Gahzi and Khan.
Here is a poem according to the weather. Enjoy the weather along with this poem.
These rains are with your presence.
If it rains, it's spring.
If it stays, then it's peace.
Sometimes it comes without a reason.
At times it spreads over day and night.
Sometimes very noisy and sometimes very quiet.
These rains are with your presence.
In a memory, at night.
To buried ash.
Sometimes, he put it out.
Sometimes, he lit himself up.
Sometimes, every drop carries sorrow.
These rains are quite like you.
All of these leaders are about to ruin a sensitive case because they do not care if the country survives.
The people should be selling their possessions or wiping the temples clean with lemon peels.
Our leaders and the media are both corrupt.
Its sole purpose is to extract money from the government.
And the people are oblivious of this.
An odd incident took place yesterday at noon.
All together police running here and there but not asking about illegal parking
The NYPD traffic police were also not in a mood to look at illegal parked cars.
it happened like this that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in Hudson river.
Until now it is just known this that ""Terrorists"" relation was with birds race Goose.
Yesterday was maybe New York's historic cold
Temperature normally do not drop to this degree.
My jaw is beginning to hurt after half an hour of strolling outside.
Imagine that what would have happened to those people who jumped from a plane into the river.
Happy news is that the people all stayed safe.
The sad news is that the ship of company sank in this financial crisis.
I went by West Side Highway to New Jersey. While watching all this, I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I still do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, in my one hour trip, the way had opened at least a bit so I was able to get the 56th street exit.
Otherwise, I would have not taken the previous two exits, seeing the lines waiting at them.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women
Shaguftah: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I have slaughtered two chickens and how they are slaughtered, Jahanzeb has already mentioned.
Apart from this, there is no other way.
At this farm, one has to get his own meat done including removing the skin.

We unnecessarily kept thinking of these Taliban of Swat as indelicate, but who were only unhappy over women's education.
They kept expressing their grief by demolishing a women's school and college somewhere every day.
But just like other ideas, this idea also did not come true, according to this report by CNN. Today on the sacred day of Monday this Taliban gang of Swat have blasted a boy's school.
In Swat, the Taliban destroyed the school.
The girls' schools were pulled down first in the cause of famous English school Ladies First and I do not understand why people consider Taliban free of crimes.
It is also known that it is wrong that Taliban are only against the education of girls.
The are totally against education of any kind.
These freedom fighters are gifted, more powerful than the Devil.
which is commanding us and he is helped to abolish it.
Amin after it Amin.
Wonderful, 120 schools have been pulled down so far.
The Muslim tradition of engagement before birth, to marriage with Quran in order to control inheritance and the insistence of many mufties that the girl became adult and sensible at 8 years old. In India, a girl was married to a frog.
See the pictures at the time of marriage.
Some days go, a girl's marriage with a dog become fresh.
I see that now.
Humanity is rare in the 21st century.
It is the age of the computer. The computer a place in every walk of life.
Many people have objections to the interference of computers in financial matters.
Although credit card users' personal lives are under more control of law enforcement agencies.
Now the record of financial matters can easily be tracked by using credit cards.
In the future, when usage of currency decreases, its importance will increase.
In the crime world, the risk is not taken to rob banks. Now credit card information is stolen.
Similarly friends are also made through computers.
Social networking websites like Orket, Facebook and MySpace have the first accepting level.
But has it not occurred to you that as we obey these social networks as we are being away from the people in act.
So, this way you have seen your wanted people and their index in the matchmaking website.
Now can you spend your life with a person like you?
I cannot spend and for this the wife is also called half body.
That she fulfill my void.
I am probably not intelligent.
I considered true all the elder's advice.
And so I had assurance that my father knew the answer to every question in the world.
I was laughed at because of it.
But only that saying seemed true, which is possible.
Mad?  Why not just tell the truth?
Bore did not understand this saying inspite of his age.
So I am trying to tell the truth about this as much as is possible.
Do not misguide someone by lieing and then attaching Allah's name in order to appear honest.
And, Allah willing, say only when there is a prayer to Allah that work is completed.
Allah knows the true intentions of someone.
This is a disgusting problem which is created because of a distance from religion.
According to law of both Pakistan and our religion, minor children should stay with their mother.
Their expenses should be paid by their father and the father should be able to meet with the children.
Then when they become mature, they can live with whom they want.
The actual problems are the relatives who misguide them.
Feudalism has overshadowed our deeds.
Even here is thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in father's property so it is resisted, although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated.
These restrictions regarding relations have created many evils in society.
Concept of remarriage of a divorced women, or a widow is becoming rare.
Due to these unnecessary beliefs and traditions, the family system is facing disarray.
Why is it in our society, if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarries, it is not appreciated?
A Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago,  had all his children married, but when he married a widow, his own children went against him.
In my opinion, this is due to religion, is it not?
What type of mentality is the "'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place" kind of mentality?
I believe that this person's children should have thought what's wrong if he married a widow after he married off all his children?
This widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
As the children would get busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow, if their wives refuse to look after them when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society we are facing for the last 40-50 years.
The feeling of a wife is that her husband can do lots of bad things whatever it may be, but he doesnot has the marry again
If she has the potency, she will try, even after her death.
Along with her husband, she also losing the life after death, and she is one for the evils things in the environment
Saying Islam, Islam from the mouth does not do any thing, we like the thing which are there in rituals
like, demotivation for the girls education, and love marriage, etc.,
now your Question is, if the big brother rather bringing the widow to his home, he might have went to her home itself, then there will no querrals from his children, (they quarrel may be in the widows children)
We embraced Islam even before the separation of Hindustan and Pakistan, but we have not came out of such evil thinking and this ritual are a more important than islam
The second marriage of a man is bad, divorce is known to be bad. The divorced woman is untouchablesion, the marriage of a man with a elder woman is said to be the evil plan of the woman. the above things are of such evil thinkings
and we think that if we wont follow modernism, we considered to a old thinking man
Embracing Islam is easy, but to come out from such evil thinking is somewhat impossible.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Amen
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.
Century passed writing such little writing
Know that little is much.
Allah Hafiz
Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes, "I found this secret in my life that if the leader of any Army is in the front line, then that Army will never lose."
But here the situation is otherwise.
To say that common people are there to die for us, if we die then we are a martyr,
but, if someone from the common people dies then it is murder.
May Allah bless and have mercy on you.
When I was coming back to the shop after Isha prayer tonight, one man who was sitting in a car, raised his hand and asked me to come.
I thought maybe this man has forgotten his way or maybe he wants to ask something. I stopped seeing his whole family was in his car.
He asked if I can understand Arabic very well or not. I said that there is no problem. You tell me what is the matter.
He started saying, I have come from Riyadh but here some one in Medina picked my pocket if you could please help me. I said forget about it. Because this has happened with me earlier also as I gave this man 20 riyals to pay for gas and go back to Riyadh but he started doing the same thing after moving forward a little.
I got really angry and when I told him and threatened him of a cop, he vanished from there.
So now this is the condition of us Muslims that even when we come to beg money, we come with families riding in cars and daily manage to get at least 2 to 3000.
Although there is an evident saying of the Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the hand above is better than the hand below and the hand above is the giving hand the lower is the taking hand.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims ( Amen)

The wife of the famous singer, Adnan Sami, went to a police station in Mumbai. She accused him of torturing her.
The police station advised her to contact a court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Giladari gave a complaint against her husband saying that he continuously tortured her.
He treats her in a non-human manner.
Now it has become difficult for her to bear. This is why she has filed a case against him.
The police, instead of filing a case, told her to contact a court. They said that this matter was not one in which the police could control.
In your opinion, is the accusation of the wife of Adnan Sami proper?
This is not an Indian effort to disgrace Adnan Sami, is it?
Let us know your opinion on this issue.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
As far as allegations are concerned, anyone can post it on someone else.
Nothing comes before prestige.
however may be the relations between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he left his respectful life and went to India to make money and now this fame has caught him badly.
This is a consequence of his own deeds.
Washington...
Top American officials say that president Obama will take a strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
In the new American policy over Afghanistan there is more emphasis on war than development.
Officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in the achievement of American goals Since in his government, there is corruption, drugs business has increased and Taliban are regaining their power.
American officials say that people, who are putting more pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more, include vice president Joe Biden and President Obama's representative for Afhanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke.
He said that this policy appeared after President Bush, who used to video conference with Hamid Karzai every two weeks, left. He used to stress upon the American role in rebuilding Afghanistan and its civilian institutions.
Officials say that the Obama government would rather work with the State leaders than the central government.
The officials say that it will pressurize Karzai to step up the war against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing fresh elections this year and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his group will support Karzai for presidency or not.
This statement of the American officials is not a precursor for a change in the American policy towards Afghanistan...is it?
Is Hamid Karzai's rule coming to an end?
What is your opinion about this?
In a series of three one day matches between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2-1.
Pakistan had defeated Sri Lanka in the first match, but Sri Lanka was victorious in the remaining two matches.
In the third one day match, the national cricket team's performance was very poor. In reply to Sri Lanka's 309 runs, it only managed to hit 75 runs in 23 overs before going all out. As such, it had to face a humiliating loss.
From the results of the series, it becomes evident that the performance of the national cricket team is not consistent.
Despite home field advantage and all claims, the national team suffered defeat. What do you think are the reasons?
Which aspects of the game should experts focus on?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
Which part do you place the responsibility of the loss on, fielding, batting or bowling?
Let us know your opinion.
Malik Babar Husain, Jeddah. It is very sad that even in today's modern age, such ignorant traditions are prevalent. If the landlord or the property owner targets innocent people with his harsh dictatorship, who will call them Muslims?
Let any big shot walk on these burning coals. Why does the government allow them to do that?
When will legal justice come into play?
The Sri Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan, to play the one day international series.
Besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
Upon reaching the Karachi airport, the Sri Lankan team was very warmly welcomed.
Two days between Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be played in Karachi whereas the third day will be played in Lahore.
Both teams have their claims over bowling, batting and fielding.
If the Sri Lankans are proud of their spinners, the Pakistanis trust their fast bowlers.
Sri Lankan Captain Mahela Jayvardena has said that not a single player from the Pakistan team is dangerous, but the whole team is dangerous.
Murli Dharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, whereas the Pakistan captain says that it will be a tough competition.
Shoaib Malik has said that we have played Murli Dharan and we'll see Mendis as well. We have prepared a secret game plan and we shall implement that on the ground.
Will the Pak-Sri Lanka series be really as interesting and exciting as the claims are?
Who will dominate the series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Give your opinion.
Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.
Malik Yusuf, Dubai.
The Kashmiri people have been fighting for independence for the last 60 years.
No, no one asked, and they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism, so they start talking about making up.
First they openly killed the Muslims, now they are trying to set things right.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating such a situation so that the world's attention can be diverted from Kashmir.
But Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now the British Government is also understanding that the Indians are taking cover from their occupation over Kashmir by accusing Pakistan of terrorism.
They hesitate to talk to Pakistan about this issue.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that resolving the issue of Kashmir will bring an end to extremism, and the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
It should be clear that newly-elected American President Obama has also expressed similar views about the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister has written in an article and told the media that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of President Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
Due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Does India want the allegations of terrorism to be its scapegoat to avoid peace talks?
Tell us your opinion.

In my opinion, a lot of the powerful nations do not want to bring harm to Pakistan.
But they are thinking of plans to keep it on their leash as they know that Pakistan is a nuclear power.
They want to fuel a situation for a revolution.
Other nations are thinking that in cornering Pakistan they may face geographical political problems. They also want to aid Pakistan, but along with that they also want to accomplish their ulterior motives.
A citizen, USA
Indians have been known to be snakes in the grass.
In my opinion, they get cramps every now and then, which causes them to give baseless threats.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian army chief should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.
Faheem Siddiqi
This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but we know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is in hot water.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The prime minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani, said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden, played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing him with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the Parliament.
The prime minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers' movement not played any role?
What do you have to say about this statement, in regards to the Prime Minister?
Make us aware of your opinion.
American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference, advised newly elected President, Barack Obama. Former president G.W. Bush said that he had made many mistakes in his presidency and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
'I did, as a president, whatever I felt was appropriate, according to the situation, and the American law and constitution, giving preference to American interest over my own acceptance'.
President Bush said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him, and considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this would be his last press conference, and thanked the journalists and other friends who were present in the press conference.
Do you think Obama will repeat the mistakes that Bush made?
Did Bush delay accepting his mistake?
Will Obama be able to follow Bush's advice?
Give us your opinion.
American Vice President Dick Cheney said, "I want to see Osama Bin Laden alive or dead."
He said that Osama Bin Laden is hiding in some hard to reach area and is of no use to his organization, and if Osama Bin Laden is arrested alive or dead then his organization must be destroyed.
America intends to arrest Osama and the search for Osama is on.
Will Dick Cheney's goal to arrest Osama be accomplished?
Give us your opinion.
After the completion of Quaid Azam Trophy match between PIA and Habib Bank, the all-rounder cricketer Shahid Affridi had a altercation with one fan.
When Shahid Affridi came out of the drawing room after playing the match on the UBL ground, a large number of fans gathered around him.
In one instance, a fan held his hand and asked to take a photo with him, after which Shahid Affridi removed his hand from the fan's and said that he can take the photo tomorrow. After further insistence from the fan, Affridi became angry and slapped him. An altercation then began between Affridi and the fan, though the crowd seemed to dismiss the matter there.
Shahid Affridi later said that he had been in a hurry to attend the prayer.
Anyway, I beg pardon for this drama.
What do you say about Shahid Afridi's actions?
Tell us your opinion.
Manmohan Singh once again accused Pakistan of creating a war-like atmosphere.
Pakistan is using terrorism as a policy of state.
Speaking to a meeting of the cabinet of ministers, Manmohan Singh said that terrorist factions are being supported by neighboring countries, especially Pakistan.
And the terrorists who attacked Mumbai used the seaway and remained safe from the coastal guard.
The Indian Prime Minister said that the Mumbai attacks of November were carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba.
He said that the terrorists were using new techniques and modern communication systems. We will have to step up the forces at the line of control as well, from where there is infiltration. He said that terrorism will not be accepted in any form, and this is our policy.
How do you view this accusation of the Indian prime minister?
Do not the internal chaos and separation movements of India show India's anxiety?
On whose signals has India chosen to have a threatening attitude?

Zubeer Khan, Karachi
This is a very hurtful incident that Israel is publicly massacring the Palestinians; the same situation is here in Kashmir but the Security Council does not even bother with it.
As many organizations who are in Palestine and Kashmir should continue their fight till freedom and by creating unity between themselves keep fighting every kind of aggression, one of these days their Martyr will bring result. By the will of Allah
Israeli air attacks still continue in Gaza, as now several Palestinian Men, Women and children have been murdered.
Important political leader Hamas Nazarian has been martyred with his wife and kids.
Their meeting of the Security Council ended without any decision.
The condemning resolution presented by Libia and other Arab countries against Israel is facing American opposition in the meeting.
Israel's jet planes have been bombarding the residential areas of Palestine for last many days.
Every country around the world began to protest against the Mumbai attacks but can't anyone see this brutality including America and Britain?
Why are the major Muslim countries quiet?
What is your opinion on these double standards of the world?
Saeed, New York.
In my opinion, the basic fact is that most of our people are uneducated and they don't even know where their money is actually going. Government is interested in doing its job properly by applying and collecting taxes. Shortfalls of electricity and gas will continue in the same manner.
Because everyone knows about the character of those who have been elected by our own nation.
Shortages of electricity and gas all over Pakistan has become a critical state.
On the other hand the gas tariff has been raised to 8% whereas in some cities, due to the non-availability of petrol, the difficulties and miseries of the masses are increasing.
Due to the long load shedding of electricity and gas crisis in Pakistan's industrial and business sector, there is a severe reaction. Riots and violent protests are taking place.
The producers have given the ultimatum to close the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is perturbed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
The production life cycle has become practically paralyzed.
The government institutions are blaming each other to explain their stances.
Are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas a joke against the nation?
Why is attention not being paid to solve the problems?
Are the wheels of national development not seeming jammed to the government?
What immediate steps can you suggest to gain control over this crisis?
Let us know your opinions.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that government is carrying slogan of public service is itself hurting them.
The unavailability of electricity, gas, and petrol has become a persecution.
Government has no control over the institutions.
Law and order is deteriorating every day, may Allah bestow his mercy on this country.
The new year has started.
Last year was the year of outbreaks and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered in reference to the terrorism.
The stepping down of President Musharf and the end of the eight years rule of president Bush; throwing of shoes on Bush and formation of democratic government in Pakistan; calamities; earthquake in Baluchistan; global financial slump and monopoly.
The new year is arriving, how do you foresee it?
In your opinion, what will be the result of the political or geographical situation? What will be Obama's strategy?
Is there a hope of a development towards eliminating terrorism?
Is the judicial crisis of Pakistan done?
What shape will the Pakistan-India relationship adopt?
Is there a chance of surgical strike or full scale war?
What expectations do you have for the new year?

The first anniversary of Benazir Bhutto's death is being observed. She was martyred in an election rally at Liaquat Garden Rawalpindi on December 27, 2007.
Today Benazir is not with us. She was a seasoned politician and a personality of international reknown; she had a unique status in the country's politics.
The mystery of her murder has not been solved until today.
Her efforts to establish government and democracy in the country has not been in vain.
Today, a democratic government has been established in Pakistan, and her husband Asif Ali Zardari is president of the state.
What do you think if the role of martyr Benazir Bhutto is in Pakistani politics?
Who can be her behind murdering?
Recently,, she was given the global human rights award. What would you like to say about her democratic and political services?
After ruling over America for eight years, President Bush left the White House, for presidential camp office, Camp David, so that the White House can be decorated and prepared for new President Barack Obama, according to his wishes.
In Bush's eight year presidency, the historic World Trade Center attack, the attack on the Pentagon, the action against Afghanistan and Iraq in the name of a global war against terrorism, in which armies of many countries were pulled into the war, and American resources were completely exhausted, were some of the memorable events of the Bush era.
As a result of this war, America had to face the worst economic and financial crisis in history.
What do you think the world got and what do you think it lost as a result of this war?
Were the policies of President Bush successful?
What are your views of the Bush era?
The Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from touring Pakistan.
The Indian Cricket Team had to play three tests, five one day matches and one twenty on Pakistan Tour.
Vice president of the Indian Cricket Board, Rajeev Shukla, said that the board has asked the government to allow the Pakistan Tour but because of the serious matters between the two countries this tour is not possible.
Is it right to use available political issue of the Indian government as the passport to cancel the cricket tour, the games must not be kept away from politics?
Isn't the decision of the Indian Government about cricket a loss?
Even though the security in India was poor, the English Cricket Team tour was going on, so why don't the Indian team do the Pakistan Tour?
What is your opinion in this regard?
Salman, Karachi.
People feel proud about going to India.
And their films and videos are made there; now their eyes must open to see that how much the Indian people respect you.
I remember one interview of Adnan Samee where he said "I am not a Pakistani, my popularity is British."
Adnan Sami needs to come to Pakistan at the first opportunity because respect was not accorded him even there.
Fareed Ahmad
Karachi
Indian attitudes have changed after the Mumbai attack.
Jagjit reacted with hate toward Pakistan and Pakistani people.
Adnan Sami sung seven songs of Asha Bhosla, now how can he be out of tune?  Adnan Sami should stay in India: no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam
I will only say this on the statement of Jagjit Singh in Karachi: he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements suitable to situation Pakistanis open your eyes that how much you are given worth in India, understand the thinking of Hindu.
After the Mumbai incident, their hateful statements have increased and they are now spitting poison against popular singer Adnan Sami.
According to foreign news agencies, in the farewell trip of American President George Bush, during a press conference with the Prime Minister Nur-al-Maliki, in his office, the situation became hilarious when an Iraqi journalist called Bush saying "Dog, this is a farewell kiss."
After this, the journalist took his shoe off and threw it at Bush. President Bush ducked with expertise and saved himself from getting hit by the shoe.
The second shoe hit the American flag.
Security agents pulled this journalist away from there.
On this occasion, President Bush said that he did not know why he did that, the shoe was a size ten and he was not bothered.
In your opinion, does this action of the journalist show the anger of the Iraqi public against President Bush?
What do you say about this incident?
After the Mumbai terror incidents, the tension in Indo-Pak relations escalated to a grave extent, when Indian Air Force war planes violated Pakistani air space in the Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
Due to the reaction of the Pakistani Air Force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
According to sources, both Indian planes were full of weapons and ammunition.
This is the first of its kind incident in the current tensed situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that it is ready to defend the country.
Information Minister Sherry Rahman says that Indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed, although this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
In your opinion, does India really have an intention of an air strike on Pakistan?
Is this statement of India correct that this violation was a mistake or this was to find out the ability of the Pakistan Air Force?
Is this incident not going to aggravate the current estrangement among the two countries?

Respected martyr Benazir Bhutto was given the International Award for Human Rights after her death, which was received by her son and chairperson of the People's Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
During a session of the General Assembly in the United Nations headquarters, the former prime minister of Pakistan, martyr Benazir Bhutto, was presented with this award for acknowledgment of her efforts for human rights in a ceremony.
On the December 10th the United Nations celebrated the 60th anniversary of the passage of the human rights resolution.
Benazir Bhutto, former American Attorney General Louis Ramsey Clark, and the worldwide Human Rights Watch were among the people and institutes being recognized with honors for their work in human rights on the occasion.
Present for the occasion were Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Abdullah Hussain Haroon and other senior embassy agents.
What do you think about the martyred former Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, receiving this award?
Samir
Chicago
It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, and how proud she was of Naseerullah Babar's success.
However, she completely changed later.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party, and made her son the representative of Peoples Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi. This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
An axe cant cut the wood if it does not have a wooden handle.
Our rulers are responsible for our country's hardships and problems.
May God bless our rulers with rightness.
A panel of the U.N. Security Council has included the names of Hafaiz Saeed and three other Pakistanis in the list of terrorists.
The names of Hafiz Mohammad Saeed (the chief Jamat-ul-Dawa), Rehman Lakhvi (Lashkar-i-Taiba's chief of operations), and Haji Mohammad Ashraf (Lashar-i-Taiba's head of finance) have been included in the list of terrorists. This list has been approved by the Security Council's committee on Alqaida and Taliban.
Beside these, Saudi citizen Mehmood Ahmed's name is also included on this list of terrorists.
Jamat-ul-Dawa, Passban-i-Kashmir and Alrashid trusts are included in these organizations.
The member countries will freeze the assets of these people and organizations. These people will not be allowed to travel and they will be arrested if they do.
They have to face the cases.
Aren't these sanctions made under the influence of Indian propaganda?
Why is India blaming these parties for the Bombay attacks without any proof?
Aren't there any terrorist groups in India?
Are international groups not aware of the tortures being done upon the minorities in India?
