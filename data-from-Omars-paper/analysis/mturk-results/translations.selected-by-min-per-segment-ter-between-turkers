The role of European Union for the peace in Middle East
Officially European Union plays a decisive role in the mediatory efforts taken for stopping the war in Middle East.
According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of Sarkozy are helping hands in this process.
European Union spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said every single step which may help in delivering the conjoint message of European Union to fighting parties is appreciable.
it seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned.
But in fact European Union is portraying a picture of internal tension, stress and strain.
The role of Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak
plus internal affairs has made her helpless.
On the other hand the course of action of French President Sarkozy depicts that France is still the President of European Union.
Whereas France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it.
The most ridiculous situation faces the foreign minister of France, Bernard Kouchner.
He is in the delegation which is led by Schwarzenberg the Foreign Minister of Czech Republic.
In addition to that, the two foreign ministers are giving different statements on the war in Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend herself, while according to Kouchner war is not the defense. Germany has also sent a special ambassador to Middle East. As long as European Union does not show unanimous stand, she can not be successful on diplomatic front.
The prove is the no lift conduct of Israel to mediatory efforts of European Union.
This is the best time for European Union to prove herself, as America has failed in Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.
Financial crisis: German millionaire industrialist's suicide
Adolf Marclay, resident of Swabia in south Germany has left behind a huge industrialist group.
But earlier common German citizens did not know much about him.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks for weeks regarding his debts towards industrial groups, he became the hot news and could see the dark future for Marckay group.
Marclay Group had to bear the loss of hundreds of million euros after it bought the shares of one of known industry Folks Wigan.
then the financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed 100 Million and 1 billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on Marclay.
Recently the same banks accepted to provide loan to Marclay group on urgent basis but Adolf Marclay who started as a small industrialist to reach a place where his industrial group's annual income reached 30 billion euros, couldn't bear the the loss in his financial strength.
After the death of his father when Adolf Marclay took the responsibility of the business he used modern methods and made the business more successful.
He named his company Ratiopharm which is now Germany's most successful and biggest pharmaceutical company.
Till recent times this phamasutical company had a budget of around 5 to 6 billion euros and even now it is earning around 8 billion euros annually. After the great success of Rasue farm the Marclay Group bought many big industries like Hi-Del Barag Cement a manufacture of construction equipment. Kassbohrer and other good car maker
Marclay Group has a employee number of around 100 thousand around the world and among its industries, Rasue Farm has always been given special importance.
Adolf Marclay has said this many times in his life. ""We have been in pharma business since four generations"".
Now the industry is handled by the children and i hope that it continues to work for few hundred years by our family.

Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.

Why the reduction of exercise with increasing age?
New Research
Exercise is good for health in any age.
This makes your heart stronger, decreases cholesterol levels, helps in reducing weight, helps stop diabetes and decreases the chances of Alzheimer's.
Unfortunately, a lot of people tend to exercise less with age.
experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, not getting enough exercise can lead to numerous health issues.
Dr. Patricia Paylekka of the Mew Clinic of Minnesota reports that with increase in age, exercise is a major factor in determining proper body functioning.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.
She has done extensive research on older age and the ability to exercise with increasing age.
The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart.
In which, the ability of the heart to pump blood, and it's ability to shrink and relax was researched.
Experts have concentrated mainly on the left side of the heart which is mainly responsible for the pumping of blood.
They discovered that with increase in age, the problems in the rate of heart relaxation also increase.
Dr. Patricia says that with increase in age, the problems in the heart relaxation rates increases and thus effects the ability to exercise with growing age.
Dr. Carwin Cain was also part of this research.
He says that it's surprising to see the permanent effects of improper exercise on the heart.
In some instances, blood pressure is a factor in heart anomalies and heart diseases.
If doctors and patients can work together when it comes to heart diseases, then they can enjoy the benefits of exercise even with older age.
A detailed report has been published in the Journal of American Medical Association.

May God bring people's dialogue pleasantness and bring Barack as blessing to world
Well there is no hope but see what Pakistan-America relationship brings to us in the result of this change
That what will Mr. Barrack Obama give to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams.
Obama's (whose name has Hussein also), oath as a President of America on one hand is historical while on the other hand is a hard test too
Not only for himself, but also for all the people who supported him.
This will also be a test for white people majority as it is not easy for them to accept heartily the presidency of black on them.
Here in Southern Asia specially Muslims who have developed expectation from him must remember that he has been elected as President of America and Obama must remember that President of America is Practically the president of the whole world.
From now a little bit later a person whose is a servant has been bought to America from their countries and whose blood and sweat has strong urge to do holy war is today American 24th president.
Many people have many expectations from this man.
It is necessary for people who likes him not to have over expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds in lowering race, religion and other differences then it will be a victory for people who love him.
What effect will this change have on South Asia, and what considerable change can be expected in the American policy in this regards?
What will be the effect of these changes on relationship between Pakistan and America

My Sir, whether it be Obama or someone else, the type of policies with regards to the whole world is decided by the multi-billionaire, influential, strong Jewish lobby.
And whereas Pakistan is related recently on issue of bombings on mumbai . India, Israel and America have lost peace is in front of the world
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat, who had a regular Army and Law.
They surrendered their rule to the government of Pakistan according to a treaty.
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a step mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government of the ruler of Swat.
And also there showed no interest in their developments.
Currently the number of girls acquiring education is far less than in previous years.
Targeting of educational institutes is continued by local Talibans in NWFP Province of Pakistan.
The maximum number of schools have been destroyed in district Swat in which majority are the girls schools.
Not only this Taliban has announced a ban on girls education.
Thousands of boy and girl students are being deprived of education.
What do you think Talibans wants to achieve by stopping women education.
Why the government has failed to stop these illegal actions?
what do you think the government should do.
Question must be this that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
Because Swat people has understand the game that army is there to serve Taliban not to kill them otherwise how five schools can be destroyed in a single night during curfew, how people can be butchered and hanged in the square.
When government writ is unable to implement in Swat in these circumstances how the government will succeed in eliminating these illegal activities.
Now the question is when government has every thing like armed force, latest weapons, latest technology and spy system then why these Taliban can;t be controlled?
The only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught.
The essence is that these Taliban are paving the path for 'International Imperialism' by their bad deeds.
from now fifteen years back Afghanistan was facing a war
ISI had control over Taliban. which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly the scenario changed and the activities of the Taliban came into light.
ISI received dollar offerings from America there by close friends turned to enemies.
the results are this the war is still continued. but in reality Pakistan is helped by Iran, India and Russia
It is a human mistake of doing wrong by not doing what is right.
If a thief robs a place, then he is in danger to rob the same place and same time tomorrow as well. If he fears god and man, he will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play Holi with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings!
The question is whether war, armed movements and   terrorism are the answer to our problems?
If not then what is that chemical prescription that   will take us to the solution of these problems?
This is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but rather it puts 'blessings' in them.
In their movements, Palestine, Afghanistan, Iraq should  take the path that Nelson Mandela took in South Africa  as a model.
That means political and inner struggle are more   important than armed struggle.
From the participation of Kashmiris in elections it   can seen that they have accepted this point-of-view.
The Israeli  attacks on Gaza still continue in the third week and the death toll have reached to one thousand.
In spite of international diplomatic efforts ,yet it did not reach to cease-fire.
According to an estimate,since the attacks started on 27 December to uptill now,90 thousand Palestinian left their homes and have been migrated to the safe areas.
On the other hand relief organizations said by accusing Israel of dereliction of duty toward the protection of Palestinian children ,that the one entire generation of Palestinian children has become victim of serious psychological and emotional difficulties.
what do you say?
What should be done?
How is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Taliban should be given a chance
Basit, Peshawar
Be aware if taliban started the real jehad then who will slaughter the innocent people?
Who will burn down the girls' schools?
and if kidnap for ransom or not get ransom so who will hang people on the pole by called them American spy?
These Taliban has damaged Islam so much that no other nation or religion has done.
Persian era.
Kohat, Pakistan
if the whole Muslim world just give a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see that how upset will its father America be.
and not only talks about real ceasefire rather ceasefire will be accomplished.
but what can be done, where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from.
someone tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step as he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights does not rest with the Arabs or the Muslims of the world alone but is the obligation of the entire world community to raise their voice against tyranny.
This dreadful incident is the worst amongst the crimes committed by Bush.
Just like in Pakistan and India at the end of the financial year on 30th of June, the governmental institutions are pillaged; the American establishment before the expiry of its term gave a green signal to Israel to do whatever she wants.
On the one hand, America says that a ceasefire will be attempted.
On the other hand, the United Nations is accepting petitions and more petitions, but in reality it's nothing. This means only one thing, that even the United Nations is in on the conspiracy against muslims.
All Muslim nations should disregard the United Nations, and unite under their own weight.
We have a lot of examples in front of us. Where America and United Nations are only passing petitions, the Muslims are bearing the brunt of it.
What is the use of this probaganda when BBC is not going to publish it.
Now where are all the journalism principles. When it comes to muslims blood BBC seems to take its eyes off the reality.
By the way self proclaimed leader of rights.
Pubslishing something from their own sounds far, they even din't publish the discussions.
from the Muslims.
They say that in the World you are very much difference  By Remining Muslims you and other muslims are in martyred direction and they say all about the muslims
[syja786]
For a while, BBC forums have been making a certain point, sometimes while discussing suicide attacks and other times, terrorism in India.
In the extremism word Anti-Islam remarks of his life.
The extremists who is the comments of the above you are not terrorism to send to the particular target
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal can not be fought with the sword?
After seeing the bombardment of Israel in which innocent people unarmed heart cries tears of blood what to do?
But the basic fault is of this turmoil and massacre which by naming Jihad, we try to blacken the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existece of Israel, then what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks.
This type of behavior is against humanity.
The character played by America and United Nations again showed us their support for the cruelties of Israel.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
and the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism, after all they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, would it be possible for terrorism to take place at such a large scale without the support of some big leader? And everyone knows who is controlling the strings.
In such a situation it can be termed as high handedness "Do what ever you can".
What a forceful act, hit on the head, and do not allow to cry.
The medicines for the injured, the shroud and compensation for  the dead are being given by the Arab rulers, and the question is,
What should be done about Israeli attacks?
The problem is that the heads of state of all the muslim countries including Saudi Arabia are in a deep slumber. Neither do they have an army nor any defensive strategy. All they think of is that by giving aid, they have fulfilled their obligation.
They should immediately take practical steps against Israeli aggression.
Like placing an embargo on the oil to European countries and America but alas they ......
Greetings to all brothers and sisters!
In my opinion, telling Hamas to quit in the name of peace now, would be an injustice to thousands of widows and orphans.
If the Israelites and their supporters are at a rise, then soon Moses shall be born, as this is the law of nature. America and Israel work as gunpowder amongst suicide bombers in Muslims.
The power drunk elephants do not understand this.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Hamas and Israel should reconcile so that this bloodshed comes to an end.
Muhammad Sarfraz, Paris, France
Absolutely true.
Let’s suppose that Hamas is really the righteous one and they have waged Jihad against the tyranny to become successful in the divine court, even then they should at least realize that if good brings harm to the people then it is of no use
Those who claim to love God, his Messenger, and their religion; it becomes an integral part of their faith to love humanity.
So after muslims, all believers who are living on this earth should be wiped out according to the command of Allah?
Najibur Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
No, not to kill them, but rather the order is to invite them to Islam.
but Jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion.
To fight them until they stop their plans, but this does definitely not mean that you wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the fate of the murderer of innocent children is annihilation.
But my request to my friends is that Israelis, who had no refuge until yesterday, are now so powerful today that they don't pay heed to what the world says because the Jews are one.
They are not divided into Shiites and Sunnis but they are all Jews and have made progress in every field of life, built everything.
On the contrary, what is the condition of the 55 Islamic states?
They are lagging behind in every field and now they are so helpless that they are at the mercy of their enemy and are just waiting for their death.
now there is a need for America that all the Muslims combine and collect evidences against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
and there is no better strategy, that recognize Israel, learn modern education and means of progress and let the world live in peace and harmony.
Muslims have plenty of land and resources.
The need is for proper utilisation.
One of the shameful situation is this that there wound be no compromise between Himas and Alfath.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque and this was impossible without removing Yasin and Arafat from the way.
The world is watching that how Palestine was falling down every second after the death of these two leaders.
and how the Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
In 1974 a Pakistani Prime Minister was of such an International trust that first time in history he united all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance.
Today on his 81st birthday is it hard enough for the nation to promise for unity with each other
but by eliminating the differences between other Muslims will accomplish its (establishment of Islamic Common Wealth) incomplete mission.
This is a Jinn, which has entered Palestine for half a century.
This Jin has many mouths.
Many times this Jin converts the attention and pressure of the World by calling bad names to himeself from his own or from any other mouth.
And other mouth of this Jin is eating humen beings in Iraq,Afghanistan,Iran and in Pakistan.
And this Jin is the most anoid with Islam than any other,because it knows that whenever it had turned out,it would have been only and only by Islam, Muslims, and complete faith of Muslims and by practical Islam.The history tells that Islam has taken many people like Abu- Jehal on the right path.
Israels fighter jets start bombarding on Gaza and lunched missile attacks from 27th of December.
Due to these attacks more than 300 Palestinian civilians are dead
after the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
Hence Israeli officials have said that they would continue this inspection until they are confident about Israel not targeted by rocket attacks
In your opinion is this right for Israel to say about this inspection is to protect Israel?
In this situation is the world organization playing its role?
Is this situations due to uprising situations in Israel?
Is America after having the new President Bari Obama will there be any good in conditions in west?

The dark and tough night is very hard suffer
When has misfortune departed by praying only" (Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan)
Such reviews are anxiously telecasted by BBC.
After all the image and prestige of neutralism has to be kept.
Though BBC news are often true but the real thing is the delivery.
What to highlight and which news is given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
Now In this regard our Pakistani print and electronic media, specially few Urdu newspapers and columnists etc. are not behind in the trade who in the coverage or writing of increasing terrorism exaggerate to hell.
has said that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. how long this hypocrisy will continue.
Why there is so much atrocity on Muslims. If people like America leave backing up of Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So if Americans you have courage then leave backing up of them and see then their fate of life.
All these world renowned leaders and people who murder innocents in the name of peace should realize that peace in the world can only be achieved by justice, and not through injustice or wiping entire races.
If killing a particular race off completely is the answer, then Hitler's plan would not have seen any jews survive, and definitely not seen their rise.
Says a poet
Injustice is injustice. If it breeds, it dies.
Blood is blood. If it bleeds, it dries.
Now who can tell who did terrorism?
Isn't all this terrorism too? Why does only ones pain seem painful?
Aren't other people human too? So why is only Muslim blood so important? Wasn't all the innocent people's blood red too?
So why are there no disapproval messages now?
I watched the Mumbai attacks investigations like the fire was in my own home. I cannot watch this human suffering. Can't everyone else see this suffering? I wish Muslims all over could come together and think about this.
Dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood, how shall we condemn, I can not find words!
it is pity on the position of Muslims at one side if people are killed in India then the whole without evidence tells Pakistan to investigate or else we would do it
And on the other side, Israel is ruthlessly killing Muslims and the whole world is silent. This is unbearable.
God has light not darkness and when this darkness ends then.
The threat to Israeli sovereignty is a joke as long as it has America's backing.
As far as elections are concerned, it is not surprising that the people who are in power do such things to win the heart and mind of people especially in a state like Israel. And speaking of Barak Obama, history shows that no American president has wavered from the policy and will not do so in future. A tyrant is a tyrant whether he is white or black.
It appears from the conversation of forum that everyone is grieved over Benazir death but as politician her mistakes are not forgotten.
It is debatable that Benazir died for democracy or for power.
If she sacrificed for democracy then why she left democracy in the dictatorship of Musharraf for 10 years till she got a deal and American clearance?
Benazir did not return Pakistan when dictatorship affected people needed her she returned Pakistan when she has the assurances of free from cases and of power.
No one is going to say anything about the way that this historical figure is being falsely accused.
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them.
One more writer.
Sir/Madam, maybe if you read not only the history of Pakistan, but of it's neighboring four countries, or of seven other countries, then you might understand the meaning of Mr. Psycho.
Tariq Ayaz
One whose nature is wrong cannot be taught.
For reflection in water is not always clear.
Britain never let them become one, and invented the hindu-muslim friction which was taken ahead by sir Syed.
Psycho
So relentless is our nation, that they are blind when writing poetry for their parties, but no one says anything when our historical figures are battered and falsely accused.
We have progressed enough.
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey doesn't become a scholar if you put books on him.
Though the attack in Mumbai diturbed the talks between India and Pakistan, it is said that the talks would still continue between them
If the talk is about war, then there will be many loss of human lives.
During the Mumbai city attack, India said that a letter had been sent by Pakistan. Also, when extremists were captured, it was found that the this attack was well engineered by four party
First of all Bahan Saheb and to all Christian friends happy Christmas.
All the companions of firm: Seiko Saheb, Ya Raza, Bahan Sana, behan Shaheda, Ikram and all greetins for all.
We do not want the flames of war, we want the flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
What solution will the war give?
Today will give Fire and blood.
It will give hunger and need tomorrow.
Because we are all humans
it is better that war keeps postponing.
In your and our gardens
it is better that candle keeps lit.
The relations between India and America are now deep rooted and India certainly wishes that if the time comes, America shall betray Pakistan blatantly.
This is also the history of America.
Because in the case of an Indian attack, America's goals will also be fulfilled and the expenses will be India's.
Pakistan should clearly announce that it will not start, but if injury is caused, there will be no talks of peace or truce, and the war will not stop until India is completely destroyed or captured, even if it involves our destroying ourselves.
This is exactly what Islamic history is.
even before this resolution the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it more clever that effected and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has relaxed its pressure now.
The satisfaction expressed by the United Nations over Pakistani efforts and the praise by the Interpol leader of Pakistani efforts, in disregard of India's commotion, shows the side effect of India's more than necessary diplomatics.
There is no two opinions about this being a very beastly action.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past one year?
Thousands are killed every day, the number of the mortar shells and battery, the number is very uneasy for Taliban .
The ISI, I appeal to the Taliban that only thing and we will give tutelage heaven Benazir Swat to the peace.
And stop this phony operation.
That day is not far when a resolution about Pakistan's military intervention will be passed by United Nations just like the bill which was passed against Jamat-ud-Dawah.
Riaz Ahmed Farooqi
First our extremists and their supporters are continuously providing proves and reasons for the action against them and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is submitted then it is very much possible that no body will favor us in UN,
And supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.
The Israeli army samiullah adverse, and we achievements and not the information sargarmiya.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
As the bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They command even after they die.
But they were playing international game here and, is being boorishness and brutality, people scared of the rule.
There are so that she could be having that if we are not be spokesman ferocious and come to destroy the government .
Such actions of the so called Islam lovers, in the name of religion is extremely disagreeable.
The extremists gives support to the cruelty of united stated. But this looks like a brutal action against the tribal tradition.
The tradition of the Mantel Lucrative tribals have said not to take brutal action in the name of Islam
In my opinion our army, people will get the people.
They are the move, a copy of this time, so take the laser, the timetable for, so, but they will be on the occasion, and they go there, there are also have the darn cycle.
Are these people that they are so Bahadur 50 70 men are held hostage to our army and hand it to respond to keep the hand of spectators, questionably.
They are also servants of Allah and so is the army.
It is very clear that there is fishy.
ملائيت ضياءالحق his career, is now that you're امريت to God, the qualities of rahimi and karimi to highlight the contrary to the  and the name of the religion of the ودہشت fear the atmosphere is set up in this incident, the body  apart from their and ' 'after' will be severe also fear giving birth to.
And this is just worldy people  tiny amount and dignity and Jalal his intention to  as fear or beign used by the equipment.
speech!!!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell,
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It is surprising when it is said that this can not be a work of a Muslim
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.


The army's pilgrimage to the enemy  and what  Karbala and what the axle?
Without the facts and accept are unsafe, not a check.
BBC people please stop double policies
The better super hit title than this is:  the beating  of Bush with shoes is right or wrong?
Should had be
Tahir Chowdary, Japan
Friend Feel shy about a person removed from a coffin and tied to a poll just for raising his voice against injustice but have more considerations for box office reviews.
For the success of Operation Sherdil and across the border the success of Operation Lion Heart depends on the favor of people.
It is carried out by American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahib is a victim of conspiracy.
In this forum all reviews will be against Taliban, Agencies have been successfully indulged in Taliban and are applying the policies which might change public opinion.
what i only want to ask is when the body was hanging for a whole day what were the army doing were they there to only target civilians all they give their speeches is due to bombing Taliban tanks, there fell a bomb on house resulting death of two children and mother.
whether they dint know about this situation.
Or else having fun.
we fold our hands and request you to please end this game.
atlast above you also there is a master.
The BBC, was asked the question is not enough to write to see the superficialness regret, for example, a question did not present in the Swat 30 thousand army has been to what?
The Taliban of army fight the dead bodies are all day bleeding on electric poles there.
The Green sawati step, the Pakistani army has 100, media, including the BBC, the real world and the reality, is not a good ignoramus.
The Pakistani army drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
Only thing bus to drama.
These Taliban's have spoilt the name of Muslims
Through out the world if Muslims don't tell them Muslims then why would terrorists are found in their territories.
those who become insensitive and people who don't want to work hard take guns and join these groups
Islam has not spread from guns and swords.
be ashamed
Its need is neither in any religion nor in any customs.
All media including BBC gives thier views about taliban and tribal areas by different resources
But nobody knows what the actual situation is. It is we who know about it because we are tribals.
In short this is a game in which CIA, RAW, MUSAD, and our own ISI is involved.There is nothing like taliban or tribal people, they are the negative elements created by these institutions who are spoiling the name of Islam, Taliban, Religous institutes, Pukhtoon nation and Tribals.
Because of this act, head of the Muslims petulance of shame .
I salute  to M.Q.M leader Iltaf Hussein,A.N.P and to the division of the P.P.P for raising their voices against this cancer,named Taliban.
This cancer is creation of Zia-ul-haq,who is gone but he has also destroyed the Pakistan.
But i am hopefull that the present Government will abolish this Cancer.
After Mumbai attacks India said that few extremist groups are involved in these attacks.
Pakistan refuted these claims and said that it would help India in investigation in every possible way.
India said that she has provided Pakistan a list of 20 extremists, who are wanted to India.
Noe Pakistan said that leader of Jaish e Muhammad Maulana Masud Azhar present in this list is not detained and Government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Previously, the President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari had rejected the idea that western intelligence agencies and the Indian government had provided Pakistan proof about the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari said about Ajmal Qasab that it is not yet proven that he is Pakistani.
During this, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that the its relations with India are not going to improve until its land is continued to be used for terrorism.
And in latest development, Indian Cricket team has cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should these political incidents affect sports?
How do you see the future of Pakistan and India relations?
Neither America will break Pakistan nor India.
Pakistan will be broken by Pakistanis themselves.
What can you expect after so much internal segregation and rivalry?
However, Jinnah didn't do well with the Muslims from India, and time has already proven that.
Yasmin, Chicago.
Madam, if Jinnah's work was carried forward, then these internal cancer of segregation and rivalry would not have spread, and the muslims in India wouldn't be in the situation they are in now.
It's our fault that after him, no other leader could stand in his shoes.
But if we can't appreciate our heroes, then....
This sector does have a lot of abilities.
God knows when they will come to their senses and use the blessing of unity to make some progress.
Both countries have priests, Shiv sena, RSS etc. that constantly oppose peace.
And these negative forces do not want the sector to make any progress, hence the countries are kept on their toes.
Can you imagine the status of this place in the world for Pakistan, India and China, with just a little bit of unity?
Pakistan is cursed by God for having robbers and thieves as their appointed leaders.
May God  our country Pakistan always be safed, ameen.
But,please open your eyes to look at  the situation and ground realities around you then  you will come to know that where American  troops have reached .
Besides the country matters do not seems better.The circumstances in NWFP, Baluchistan,and the situation of Karachi in Sindh, are also in front of you .
In this situation country needs a such leader who can unite us as a single Nation.
O Allah bestow your mercy upon us.
I think a last war is the only option.
Enough is enough.
This situation is ""now or never"".
These false acts of cooperation will not solve the problem.
Nor will small terrorist attacks in each others countries.
Afterall, even Europe was founded after the last world war.
And if there had not been a great war, then they would still be fighting back and forth like Pakistan and India.
Almost all of our political parties are agreed on the fact that terrorism and sectarianism should be rooted out of the country.
But our military leadership does not seem sincere in this regard. On one hand they assure America and Europe that they are with them in this war against terror and on the other hand are covertly aiding the Taliban.
We should now ponder and set our direction and choose one path only. Thanks
There is no doubt that the majority of the movement league are from the Tayaba Group, who joined the league after the inception of Pakistan.
However, after that,  this leagues obstructed aid campaigns, and now on India's insistence, United Nations has declared them as the enemy and even the Government of Pakistan is cracking down on them.
In my opinion, if these Jihadi groups quit this religious fanaticism, and try helping instead, then it would be better for all.
The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan are employing professional criminals in the name of Jihad, the mentors of these and the mullahs are the same people who called Pakistan, Paleedistan and what not from time to time.
Now they are not leaving any stone unturned in destroying Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called Human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without rooting these miscreants out of Pakistan, the national security will be at risk.
Is there still room for consideration whether these scoundrels should be banned?
There is no place in this world for extremist mullahs whose only purpose is to kill.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What world is this where it is hard to survive for the one who names an important part of Allah's religion Islam.
Non Muslims can kill Muslim, but if Muslim even tries to take revenge then along with the whole non Muslim world our hypocrite leaders also treat the ones sincere with true and sincere religion like they are treating our great leader Hafiz Saeed now a days.
As a penalty of Mumbai attacks India.
Pakistan relations are affected, and the recent improvement of relations between two countries is enormously shocked.
India has been continually blaming active armed and unarmed groups in Pakistan
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the action against these groups.
Whereas Indian security agencies have accused Lashkar-e-Taiba of being directly responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
, in this regard Jamat Adawa has also been nominated.
It is not the first time that because of any terrorist attack the relation of these two countries are worsen.
In December 2001, after the attacks on Indian Parliament, these two neighbors were on the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
Now Jamat Adawa, to whom security analysts is a fresh disguise of Lashkr e Taiba, is demanded to be banned.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against active extremist groups on her soil?
Can by banning Jamat Adawa present India,
Pakistan crisis will vanish and to what extent it is vital to ban armed groups for establishing forever peace between the two countries.
The UN Security Council on the party Al-qaeda banned, the end of the Security Council, what are the evidence seems so hurry?
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency against the Muslims?
This we say as Accuser is Weak and witness is Strong!
India, itself has become a failed government!
The army, intelligence  and other security institutions have failed, the terrorists who hands may carry 72 hours of the Defense Department was Round and its failure of India accused Pakistan of put and the entire world.
A pagan killed the should be a noise around the world are bandaged. this song huddled?
To the dear nation of one nonpolitical, religious, farming organization...
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
Our prophet (directives for), scholars and all the saints love the people and gave respect to them, Islam remains a  peaceful religion.
The Muslims have also progressed on war grounds.
But when this beautiful Religion rose to the hands of distillation then within the human beings began the difference of religious and disbeliever and the new gateways of pride and prejudice began to open by which the world was unknown before.
Salam- Please do it with pleasure but act at your own.
Do not do it under the pressure from America.
if India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why does it not give?
And why do they accuse us with everything?
there are extremist groups and organizations in India as well, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the world?
What about in India?
What is it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the first Islamic Nuclear State. Why, is what the fight is about.
Pakistan is now in it's last stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your words touch the heart, and the situation seems so.
Now in American publications, the new map of Pakistan is being printed, and all these restrictions are now apparent in the series of events.
The Americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over Pakistan.
In this situation, if we do not stand together and show our unity, then remember, if Bangladesh can be made, then anything can happen.
Terrorist attacks should be condemned to the maximum, whether they are on the Mumbai Hotel or the Marriot Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine.
Similarly, terrorists should be hunted down irrespective of their nationality and whether they are Pakistani, Indian, American or Israeli.
Now the question is that every day terrorist attacks take place in Pakistan, hundreds of people die but the Pakistani officials along with the rest of the world stay silent.
Wasn’t the attack on the Marriot Hotel an act of terrorism?
Then why?
Appreciation for Interior Advisor Rehman Malik, Masha Allah he has become very brave!

Not this, according to BBC Mr.Malik has strongly denied the impression that arrest of terrorists are taking place because of 'someone's instructions'
Praise the lord!
Keeping Talents or not keeping talents why would not be it said.
We Palestinians are fighting a war for this.
And why are there our own interest which we are trying so hard to save?
No one has the right to interfere in any country's affairs.
We cant notice the reign of good.
If people has right view of justice or strengthens on independence respect southern institutions and not help any captain or soldier they there will be definitely peace in Pakistan which is not liked by politicians.
Pakistan is always following European and American purposes.
This goes on without the approval of many of its citizens.
And it invokes hostile sentiments.
If you believe in the United States of America, then why not just give up your place and leave honorably?
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
Security forces searched a camp of Lashar-i-tayba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
Pressure is being increased on Pakistan for taking rapid action against extremist organizations after Mumbai attacks.
India blames Lashkr e Taiba for Mumbai attacks.

She says that no doubt the extremists responsible for Mumbai attacks used Pakistani soil.
During this Peshawar Government says that unknown armed persons has set another truck stand for supply of goods to Allied Forces deployed in Afghanistan on fire, due to which more then fifty vehicles are destroyed.
It is the second attack on Neto and American supplies during 48 hours in Peshawar.
During this Pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from Karachi to Tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action.
It is revealed that during the reign of General Zia ul Huq because of the invasion of the ex USSR in Afghanistan and its resistance started by the American and Saudi funding resulted in the birth of armed groups of which Pakistan unable to terminated could not get back herself to the era before 1980s.
The question is does Pakistan want to do it?
Is Pakistan capable of doing this?
What do you say?

I have only one question from all humanitarian leaders.
If you kill their children and they bring necklace for you, this is impossible.

And now I do have a question for you that if there is any logic,statement or philosphy from the Islamic studies to Eastern and Western studies that permit killing innocent people including Nimazi(prayer offerer Muslim),labourer and job oriented poor workers in revenge of the American attacks?
If your answer is no then you need to correct your point of view.
People were armed, at that time their was a danger that Russia will turn toward Pakistan after Afghanistan, therefore people were armed.
Now when there is the danger of American attack via Afghanistan of which current American President clearly expressed in his presidential campaign then why should we disarm these people?
Only because America or India army don't have to face any civil resistance after defeating Pakistani army?
Yes, if any of them is involved in sabotage activities then only Pakistan should take action against him.
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeeb Ul Rehman Saico, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
if it is believed that lashkare tayyiba is bad then also it is not right to blame Pakistan government.
One more question is this that this terrorists has not received any help from a government or non- government Indian.
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As for as Lashkr e Taiba is concerned ongoing terrorism is not linked to it.
It must be recalled that Hafiz Saeed was the first 'Militant Leader' who declared activities of Taliban 'revolt'.
I am quite sure that Taliban agitation is a vital part of American plans so every person or organization must be eliminated who challenges Taliban in any aspect.
Despite the cooperation of the whole nation action against Lashkr due to the pressure of India indicates the nervousness and flatterness of Zardari and Co.
To terminate the expedition started by the American and Saudi funding, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society.
Also protest them that by what ethics American and Saudis are spreaded dangerous arms and so called Jihadi but in fact the virus of  loathsome literature and culture, due to which human butcher houses established in our country.
After the threat of an attack from the Indian side, an announcement from the Pakistan Army that they would pull their troops from the Afghan Border and would commit them towards India and a declaration from Taliban that they would take care of the Afghan Border, staggered the Americans badly and thus put all their weight behind Pakistan against an Indian attack.
This exposed the might of the American Army in the region.
Although India neither made any threat of an attack nor she had the courage to do so.
In addition, attacks of Taliban on the American supply lines proved to be the final nail in the coffin.
Thus, it was proved that without the help of Pakistan Government and Army, America would achieve nothing.
Karachi Business Financial Center of Pakistan is Dubai of underdeveloped areas.
Hundreds of thousand never return empty pocket from here, but since the grip of law has weekend in Western Frontier areas all eyes are on Karachi.
Now they are about to kidnap this city.
First time Pathans are named Pakhtoon, residents of a city are involved in fighting like strangers, although need of the time is unity.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speaking learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu, or its better that everybody learns English.
You will certainly think of the suggestion as absurd, but don’t you think the cause of the conflict is bizarre?
That the cause of clash is language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, during my childhood, I really gave this suggestion on numerous occasions to my friends of all ethnic and religious groups; every time people laughed at it.
At that time, these ethnic and religious sentiments of hatred were not so strong, they were merely boiling inside.
Can't understand what and why it is happening?
Are these the signs of the Day of Judgement?
For what crime are innocent people being killed?
Every one knows the causes those who want to destroy Pakistan are involved and those who commit all this have no religion or country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns
When the government comes, they just change names of the places to build a name for themselves. Just like these days airports, roads, buildings are all named Benazir.
Is this the meaning of Benazir which is happening in Karachi and to the peoples of Pakistan?
In accordance with the Mumbai attack it is said that the the task in Karachi have been failed to perform. And now that these job elements should resign.
The taking of the lives of innocent Pushtu speaking labourers and the Indian warnings have awakened the sleeping Pakistani feelings from Karachi to Khyber.
All strict applause of anger from political, religious, sectarian and national bodies is now teaching India the manners of diplomatic speech. They have provided American strategists a chance to think again.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the worse situation in Karachi and administration is not neutral.
Administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately
, police and rangers don't take action because of political parties pressure.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
Till the end administration is under political pressure such incidents will increase, Allah bless Pakistan.
In my opinion, they are the biggest terrorists.
And there are definitely some foreign forces at work here, but I do not know whose?
But if these circumstances occured in any city of N.W.F.P,then govt. had to do anything against it using all of it's resources but the govt. seems to be helpless when this is not in N.W.F.P.
Govt. should take an army action here saving a big and important city of the country from terrorism.
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
BBC Urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure and Pakistani media's condition is already weak.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
one solution to the problem is that either Urdu speakers should learn Pushto or Pushto speaking learn Urdu or better if every body learns English.
You will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but don't you think the reason for collision is ridiculous?
is language is a problem for communication?
There was another story of cruelness recorded in Karachi, terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
Wherever one could do something, he did everything. Reports on the media are 50% of what has happened here in four days.
I stayed up the last three nights and I am still afraid.
To kill the cobblers and dry fruit sellers who tried to emptify the hotels.
They who cut the ears of innocent people and rob at the super highway,are all ignorent of Allah's approach,to whom they will be a victim of one day.
In your opinion, what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
Keeping in front of painful mumbai attack of India searching reason for bad peace in Karachi is not necessary but it is straight this only happened because the shed of 'blood'
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control.
Liaqat Ali Khan and many devotees also belonged to there,for correcting the misunderstanding of Mr. Psycho I am quoting a verse
we will also repeat our elders' traditions
sacrificed for her existence and will sacrifice to save her.
Faizan Taufiq Siddiqui
It is very sad, the whole country is at stake while we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui for your kind information if Wikipedia.
org is searched for Liaqat Ali Khan, you will know that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family of an area of Punjab Karnal.
Due to his services for Muhajirs, they consider him their leader.
Every action has got a reaction.
Till our own is bearable but.
Ijaz Awan
Before that you gather a crowd of people giving suggestions over the night,I have to tell you that we can find true evidences of real missbehaving in the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalkings and posters.
We have been bearing both kinds of misbehaviour.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan, they did not face any reaction.
In return,creating problems for the same country,Pakistan
Only Muslim League (N) was left, she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to Peoples Party.
Before this MQM and Muslim League (Q) has already submitted the draft of 18th amendment in assembly and senate.
Till now it appears that 18th amendment was a political move and none of the party is sincere in its approval.
This is why nobody has raised voice in the favor of this amendment in senate or assembly and neither forced the House to approve the amendment.
It seems that by submitted the draft of 18th amendment these parties has beaten around the bushes means they can claim that we had submitted the amendment but the ruling party's speaker did not proceed.
MQM an ally of government, Muslim League (N) secret friend and Muslim League (Q) has approved the 17th amendment, then how is it possible that they are sincere in removing 17th amendment.
It is like painting red to be counted amongst martyred.
Peoples Party is not what so ever in a hurry to remove 17th amendment.
Nobody can think of cutting his own hands.
As long Zardari is President 17th amendment will be there.
This was the opinion of the majority in our survey and it is also true.
If 17th amendment was to be discarded then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is more powerful then President Pervez as along with the President he is the Chairman of Peoples Party.
Till he is president 17th amendment is there.
For removing 17th amendment political parties has to depart President Zardari from President house first.
Neither MQM wants it nor the other parties.
Most elders of our family belonged to labor class.
And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.
To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.
Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.
From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.
But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.
We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.
It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God
This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.
It was not even 30 minutes for us working that our younger son said “Dad it feels like I am not born for this job.
We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.
The son said that I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work.
Three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home.
The point of saying is that if a person picks his destiny, whatever is the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving that destiny.
But if you don’t even know what you have to do then God be with you.
It is said that don't accuse the dead, but can't help it as we see only evils in her on the first anniversary of Benazir.
On one side Benazir crushed independence movement of Sikhs by handing over the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India for her own sake and on the other hand provided India an opportunity to fully concentrate in Kashmir after crushing the movement in Punjab.
The greed of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years.
During her exile Benazir continued to give negative statements on Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir made a deal with Pervez Musharraf while betraying the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif.
During her reign Benazir provided her husband the opportunity of making money and because of this he popularized as Mr. 10 percent.
Benazir brother was killed during her reign whose assassins are still safe.
besides being a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
just like Benazir did her politics over her fathers dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came into power twice but she could not punish her the culprits of her father's political murder even she couldn't register a case against them.
It has been thirty seven years since the separation  of East Pakistan and look at the height of   insensitivity of our people and rulers that neither   did anyone mourn nor grieved over their mistakes on   that day.
It should have happened that we should look upon 16th   December as a black day and should take appropraite   steps so that this type of accident does not happen   again.
On that day, we send humanism messages to the people  of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to us.
Rulers open the file of Mehmood-ul-Rehman Commission  in order to study the reasons for the separation of  East Pakistan.
They are making strategies to bring back the Beharis   (ethnic class) stranded in Bangladesh and send them  gifts to encourage them.
But we have become so indifferent that when someone  dies in our own neighborhood we don't  know about it.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even after big tragedies we return to our routine  life the next day.
Perhaps, like East and West Germany were united, in   the same way, East and West Pakistan will also be  united once more.
We can still be united if we are prepared to make   sacrifices for each other and come out of the crust   of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be fulfilled in the   near future
Today when it was told in the news that Governor of American State Illinois has been arrested for charges of corruption
and to remove him from governorship provincial Congress is preparing for his rapid accountability, our American friend who has a keen interest in Pakistani affairs exaggeratedly said to me 'see this is democracy'.
No one is beyond the law in America.
and here is your country Pakistan whose president was dropped of the corruption charges before sworn in.
My sense of humor rouse and I said what's strange if a governor has been arrested in America, in our Pakistan prime minister was arrested overnight and once was hanged and second time was exiled.
Tell me, has it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan, those who broke the law were sent out of the presidential palace with a guard of honor. Tell me when this happened in America.
In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was suspended in such a way that besides the public support he has not be restored so far, did it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan fake degree holder has become the Health Minister, did this happen in America?
By hearing this American laughed like mads and also accepted his defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by Americans from all sides.
it looks from his smile
He thinks that the Americans are with his government. What he forgets is that these same people were with Musharraf a year before.
This picture has been taken as it was a family gathering
A photo like this was never published in the papers before; one president with three American officials.
It seems the American involvement in Pakistan has increased and more than one official is needed to do the job; or they are not relying on their new puppet the way they relied on the one before him.
This could also have been arranged keeping in mind the stories of President Zardari’s breach of commitments.
If it had been a sensible ruler, at least he would not have been grinning during the photo session and he would have had a subservient and embarrassing look on his face.
If the principle of democracy is applied on this picture then Present Zardari is in minority.
In democracy, majority rules the country and the picture reveals the actual rulers.
The scenic Swat valley is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
The government’s policy so far is to engage in talks besides the use of force.
But the use of force is achieving nothing other than strengthening the Taliban and increase in public sympathies for them.
What is needed of the government is to address the root cause of this menace instead of using force.
With the root causes addressed, Fazalullah and Taliban will die out themselves.
The Shariat Bill by the ANP government will help to address the problem to a great extent.
But the government must address the financial problems in addition to the implementation of Shariat.
General Musharraf, the rights that his aches that this nation diagonal scientists have activity will be rid of the power, but those who has the intention of changing the interview with CNN
How many expectations were there! He lost all hopes in "war and terror".
And whatever steps were expected were no more.
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, he made a deal with the thieves.
General Musharraf, the army had to control, but the present Government not only to what is the.
Either its Bajor or Swat, the army does not control terror but bombs the "Enemy" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy a mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy.
Despite the military operation in Swat, a war-torn area of NWFP, things are getting worse.
On one hand the writ of GOVT is limited to a resolution of condemnation passed by National assembly while on other hand the influence of Taliban's FM channel is increasing in swat.
On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
In swat security forces have used lethal weapons and have claimed to kill many extremists. But despite these causalities, Taliban's Power is rising. They are controlling nearly 80% area of Swat.
As a result, on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat, and on the other hand the Taliban is stronger.
Who is stuck in  between? The poor civilians.
"how are the Talibans" asked by someone in Swat. It is answered as "They are very good; they are fighting the war against the enemies of God"
Then asked about the army. Answer was "very good, it is fighting against the enemies of our country"
Who are the enemies of religion and country? "The poor citizens", it was answered.
I am astonished, how the Pakistan Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban's.
They are unable to track the non-juduicial F.M channel which is running by taliban,according to me that is very easy.
But still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
After closing the girls schools now they are closing the boys schools too.
Curfew is imposed so that tablibans can move around easily.
Today at night during curfew eight turcks, during curfew they entered  mangora's environ and ENTRENCHED them.
The question is that how could they reach there during curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For god sake can anyone make then understand that  help the helpless people of SWAT and release them from the talibans army and prove that pakistani army is strong enough to take action against any one of his enemy.
He says, maximum bloodshed has been done on the base of religion, you tell me in the absence of any religion wont bloodshed occur?
Punjabi, Pathan, White and Blank, Mehsood and other tribes, are these the products of religion?
Not at all, sir, religion preaches us that there is no white, black, Punjabi or Muhajir, if there is no religion then half of the world would have been destroyed by the war of black and white and remaining half by the war of cast.
Actually religion nourishes human morally and restricts him that he is not here at his own rather is sent by The Creator of Universe and he has to live by God's rules.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After moving to London, I used to call my relatives back home every single morning, although they never called us even once. Then I realized they were inconvenienced by our calling as well, so we stopped.
Living here in France, for two years, I also felt the same way.
I don't know why people always expect us to call them.
Resolution about Iraq passed in a few hours, sending UN peace force to Darfur is not a problem.
Immediate condemning Mumbai battacks and restricting suspected groups can be done in few hours.
And where there is a matter of death, we are still holding meetings about that.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
Is the wait really going on for it to finish?
so that any again no aggrieved could even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights.
When a father keeps running taking the dead body of his beloved son,even then you don't feel any pain in your heart?
If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
Rather you are a black spot on the name of humanity.
At least this was proven that this area was also Israel's country for thousands of years.
It should happen that both of the groups should compromise with each other and live in peace but as their relations are in the hands of Arab and western countries, hence without their approval there would be no peace.
and now even Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
Even if Israeli action has stopped for a while, it will start again after some incident.
The interests of BBC homeland are affiliated to America and Israel and this is why under the wrapper of 'broadmindedness' it has produced a series of blogs consisted of 'Jewish favor' and is conducting one sided and blind 'propaganda'.
BBC is only carrying the 'formality' and its objective is to have sympathies!
It is requested to Mr. Moderator that he must publish this review so that it may be proved BBC has element of realism to some extent.
Thanks.

This time it is with Dera Ghazi Khan, the country with the heavy rains of the winter season.
According to the weather a poem was created in the present discipline mentioning about the rice rain.
Do you have this heavy rains too?
It has been Bihar in this year.
As the stay has really been.
Never been so like that.
The buttermilk has never been good in the night.
Noise never ever can be the silence.
Do you have this heavy rains too?
in some remembrance some night
It is about the dust buried.
It seems that Israel will never be.
And never burned themselves
The grief was in a gradual.
Even these rains are from you.
All these things in the right to take the country, those people, or in a.

And then our media is also fraudulent like our leaders.

Yesterday noon strange thing happened.
All the police is running here and there but do not check illegal parking.
Not this, NYPD traffic was not in the mood of noticing illegally parked vehicles.
it happened like this that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in Hudson river.
Till now the only information pulled out was, ""the terrorists"" were of goose breed.
Yesterday was perhaps historic cold, in New York.
The temperature does not fall this much.
My jaw start to ache because of half an hour outside walk.
Just imagine what would have happened with those who jumped of the plane into the river.
A matter of relief as all the people were safe.
The dark side is that the Company's plane crashed in this financial crises.
While watching all this I went to New Jersey by West Side Highway. I Noticed that South Bound is blocked, still what I did?
Yes, I was jammed in it on my way back.
Thanks God,during my an hour trip the road was bit cleared as I get an exit from 56 street.
Otherwise I did not avail the first two exit due to the long lanes of vehicles.

we considered Taliban group of Swat nonreligious freely. which were only against women education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
but this thought also went wrong as some other one according to this news of CNN today on holy day of Monday Taliban demolished boys school through dynamite.
South, taliban has demolished boys school
Girls Schools according to famous proverb ""Literacy first"" following it was destructed first, Cant understand why people still believe Taliban as irresponsible and nomadic creatures?
from this condition it is clear that it is not proper to quote Taliban as against women literacy.
But by gods grace their totally against literacy.
Allah the great should give this Mujhahideen more power and rule
destroying those who rule on us may Allah help them




From on before a dog married a girl which is also freshed
Lets see that groom.
Humanity is rare in 21st century.
Today is the age of computer and computer's interference is growing in every aspect of life.
Lots of people have many reservations about this growing interference of computer like in financial issues.
As you have facilities for using credit cards but by this law enforcement agencies has also firmer grip on your private life.
That just by tracking the record of your credit card you can be exposed.
And in future when use of currency will be minimal its utility will increase.
Similarly in crimes world there is no need to rob the bank, information of credit card are hacked.
Similarly friends are also made through computers.
, social networking websites like Orcet, Facebook and MySpace are ranked first in popularity.
But don't you feel that the more closer we are getting of these sites mentally, practically moving further away from people.
Similarly there is the website of match making, where by knowing your choice you are provided with a list of people according to your likings.
Now can you spend your life with a person like you?
I can't do it, that is why a life partner is known as better half.
That he/she may cover my deficiencies.
Perhaps I received a lesser share of wisdom.
From childhood, I thought of everything as being true if it was told by an elder.
In the same way, I was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world.
I used to get laughed at a lot for this.
But only that saying seemed true which could be possible.
I was always perplexed at the need of telling a lie.
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
So I tried to keep the lies at a minimum.
I refrained from giving false hopes to others particularly with Allah’s name
And only say God willing when it was my wish that the work was to be done
Besides Allah knows what is there in the hearts.
This is a disgusting problem which is created due to reason of distance from religion.
According to both our religion and the law in Pakistan, infants should remain with their mother.
Their father is responsible for their maintenance allowance and he can meet them.
Then when the kids become mature they can decide with whom they want to live.
You have mentioned correctly that the real problem is the relatives who poison the minds.
Jagirdar thinking on all of our deeds exercises.
Thinking the same thing here working in the property of the father, a new parts and will be opposed the same otherwise his father, the process is commendable and counterfeiting.
Our relationship with the spasm establishments was created the Social abuses.
Concept of marriage of a divorced or a widow is ending.
The same unessential beliefs and traditions are being due to the anxiety family system.
In our society, if the wife of a 50-55 year old man or the husband of such a wife passes away, why are they not looked at in a nice manner?
There is a Pakistani uncle living close to us, his wife passed away around 10-12 years ago. Now after all his children got married, he married a widow, for which his kids have turned against him.
In my opinion, this is religious right, what do you say?
What type of mentality is the 'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place', kind of mentality?
In my opinion the children of this person should think that after having married all the kids, is there anything wrong in his marrying a widow?
This way the widow gets a caretaker and uncle also gets someone who will take care of his home.
Because his children would certainly be busy in their worldly affairs and would not be having time for him.
The reason behind this is ignorence.
In future what if their wives refused to work for the old man?
This is the outcome of the social pressure.
Childeren feel ashamed on the second marriage of their father when people make jokes of such family on this action.
Where as they must face the circumstances and say that what their father did,it was just according to Islam.
This is a curse in our society in which we are sunk since last 40 to 50 years.
Even a wife is agreed on the unethical activities of her husband but does not allow her for second marriage.
If she had the power She wont allow him of this even after her death.
Along with husband spoils her afterlife too and causes an increase in corruption in society.
The customs of US and Islamabad are not really the same as said by the tourists
Like that of the the culture of the girls, education, marriages etc.
As for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house, so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax, (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt).
In IndopPak we embraced Islam centuries ago but can't get rid of this unlettered thinking and considered traditions and customs superior then Islam.
Second marriage of man as ridiculous, divorce as stigma, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as disgrace and man's marriage with an elder woman as the result of her cunningness is all because of such thinking.
Moreover to copy the western nations we declare veil and worship backward.
It was easy to embrace Islam to get rid of such thinking is very difficult.
Allah bless us all the courage for it.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never that difficult.
Centuries passed in writing this little.
Consider it enough.
Allah Hafiz.
Amir taymoori in his book ""Main hoon Taymoor"" writes I realized in my life a secret that if the military commander of the military is in first row then that military would never loose.
But here the things are altogether different.
they said this that people are present only to die for us if we die then are pious
if someone from common people dies then murder
May Allah bless and have mercy on you.
I was coming back to my shop after the Isha prayer tonight, a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called.
I thought that probable this man has lost his way or wants to ask something, I stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked whether I could understand Arabic well or not. I said no problem, tell me what you want.
he started telling that he has come from Riyadh and here in Medina someone picked my pocket, kindly help me. I said please go away brother, since such an incident has already taken place with me that I gave this man 12 riyals so that he could reach Riyadh, but he started doing the same after moving a little farther.
I got very angry and said him a lot and thretened him of cops so he left the place immediately
Si this has been the situation of Muslims now for begging too we use vehicles and come with our families and through out the day cheat three thousand from people
However there is a clear Hadith (SAAW) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims ( Amen)

Wife of famous singer Adnan Sami, reached a police station in Bombay accusing him of torturing her.
The Police station advised her to contact a court.
Saba Galadari the wife of Adnan Sami gave an application against her husband that Adnan Sami continuously tortures her
and treats her inhumanely.
Now this has exceeded her tolerance limit therefore a case should be recorded against Adnan Sami.
, in place of filing case police asked her to consult the court by saying that this case is not under the jurisdiction of police.
In your opinion, is the accusation of Adnan Sami's wife on him is correct?
Can this accusation is an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Let us know about your opinion on this issue.
Adam Sanghar, Meher
As far as the allegations are concerned, anyone can levy them on any other person.
There is nothing superior to honor.
Whatever is the current state of relations between Adnan Sami and his wife, Adnan Sami left his respectable life and went to India to earn a fortune. The same fame has now importuned him.
this is a consequence of his own deeds.
Washington.
American high officials have stated that President Obama will take a stern attitude towards the Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
The new American strategy towards Afghanistan will focus on war instead of development
The officials said that Hamid Karzai is being viewed as an obstacle in achieving American interests in Afghanistan because of government corruption and drug trafficking is on the rise and the Talibans are gaining strength
The American officials also said that those people in the current administration who are pressurizing Hamid Karzai to do more include, Vice President Joe Biden and American Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrook
They stated that the policy change came after President Bush left office, who used to have video conferencing with Hamid Karzai fortnightly and emphasized the American role in the rebuilding of Afghanistan and its civil institutions.
The Obama administration will work with provincial political leaders instead of the central government.
They said that they will ask Hamid Karzai to intensify the campaign against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing new elections this year and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his administration are going to back him up in the presidential race.
Is this statement, of the American officials, a forecast of change in American policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is Hamid Karzai’s era coming to an end?
What is your say on this?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and SriLanka, Srilanka defeated Pakistan with 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Srilanka in the first one-day match although Srilanka won in the next two matches.
In this third one-day match, the nation's team performance was very poor. They worn out in only 75 runs in 23 overs against 309 runs made by the national team of Srilanka.And this is how we faced a lesson learning defeat.
The result of the series shows the inconsistency of our cricket team's performance
Despite home ground and all claims, the national team suffered defeat. What do you think are the reasons?
Which aspects of the game should experts focus on?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
which department you will hold responsible for the defeat, fielding, batting or bowling?
Kindly share your opinion.
Babar Hussain, a very well known personality said that, people are ignorant about the cultures and the landlords are targetting innocent people who are now loosing soverignity.
Why does the government not take any action against Sardars who ditches a war?
WHen will the court justice work?
The Sri Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan, to play the one day international series.
Visit of a foreign team to Pakistan, in spite of Pak India tension is a good sign.
On reaching the Karachi airport the Sirilankan team was given a warm welcome.
Two matches will be held between Pakistan and Sir Lanka in Karachi while the third one will be played in Lahore.
Both teams are asserting highly regarding their batting, bowling and fielding.
If the Sirilankans are proud of their spinners than Pakistan has its fast bowlers.
Sir Lanka’s captain Mahela Jayawardene says that no one player but the whole Pakistan cricket team is dangerous.
Muralidharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, while Pakistan’s captain says that this competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik has said “we have played Murali Dharan before and will take care of Mendis as well. We have made a secret game plan and will reveal it on the ground”.
Will the Pakistan and Sir Lanka series live up to claims of being interesting and thrilling?
Which side will dominate in the Pakistan and Siri Lanka series?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?

Gulfam from London has published his own statement, you also give importance to such statements. We wish you also write some truth .and do not change statement like Mukherjee, because it is an order to say truth to the despotic ruler is legitimate. And it is equal to jihad. Mukherjee keeps changing his statements to stay in news.

All this is done by these people. Kashmir is fighting for its freedom from past 60 years.
No, no one  asked, now they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism so they have started talking about peace and settlement.
first they killed Muslims brutally now they are trying to resolve issues.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies.
Asad Khan: London
India is making situations so that the Kashmir situation is overlooked.
But Pakistan has always shown India's true face to the world.
Even the British government is now understanding this, that is why India is now ruining Pakistan's reputation by terrorism accusations to distract from the Kashmir situation.
And hesitates to talk with Pakistan about this.
Britains Secretary of State David Miliband said that resolving Kashmir issue will finish off the extremism and the government of Pakistan will be able to tackle the dangers faced at the border efficiently
It should be noted that recently the newly elected American President Obama has also expressed similar thoughts on the Kashmir issue
The British foreign minister while talking to media in Mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
Is India creating uncertainity in the region to avoid the resolution of Kashmir issue by big powers?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Does India want to avoid the comprehensive talks by on the basis of terrorism?
Let us know of your opinion.
Usman Aftab.
I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
rather they are thinking of certain policies to control her they are familiar that Pakistan is an atomic power
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries believe that by cornering Pakistan few hurdles may generate want to support Pakistan and also wish to achieve their goal
A citizen, USA.
Hindus always hit hard and then start speaking sweet.
I think that they get problems often in a while and they start threatning Pakistan.
We are ready from each aspect.Indian army chief should better shut his mouth up else we are capable to cross attacking.
Faheem Siddique
Raas Al Khaima, It is due to America that wrong statements are being given , America is out of its mind but now India is also doing the same, India should try attacking , then it will become crystal clear that who stands where.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
Prime Minister Syed YOusaf Raza Gillini said that the newly elected vice president Joe Biden had played an important role in steping down of previous president musharraf as army cheif and restoring crippled democracy, thats why the government of pakistan has awarded him with Sitare-e-Imtiaz (honour medal)
No political party shoud get credit of his  giving up of uniform and restoration of the democracy , Parliment is not a mere rubber stamp
All decisions will be taken in the parliment
Prime minister said that the chapter of Doctor Qadeer has been closed
What do you think, the peoples protest against dictatorship has no value at all?
Has the lawyers movement not played any role?
What are your views about this statement of the Prime Minister
Do enlighten us with your views
U.S. President George W. Bush in his farewell press conference advised the newly elected President Barak Obama by saying that he has done many mistakes in his presidency and if Barak Obama finds something right,just do it.
As the President I have taken steps according to  the situation and the Constitution and  under the law,  given priority to the American interests on my popularity.
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
He said that not to get the Mass destruction weapons,  was  my largest  disappointment and  the biggest mistake was to admit the completion of the Iraq   mission.
While addressing the American Pesident  in the White House in his last press conference has said that it is my last press conference I thank to journalists and other friends who attended  this Conference .
Do you think Obama will not repeat the mistakes that Bush made?
Has it been delayed by Bush to acknowledge  the mistake?
Shall Obama  follow the advice of  Bush conciliatory?
Give us your opinion.
Vice President Dick Cheney wants to see Osama bin Laden  live or dead.
He says that Usama Bin Laden is hiding in some hard to reach area and is of no use to his organization, if Usama Bin Laden is arrested alive or dead then his organization must be destroyed.
America for the arrest of Osama bin Laden and determination to search should mortgage.
Did dick Cheney's wishes will come true for The arrest of Osama?

The Indian President Manmohan Singh has again accused Pakistan of hyping the talk of war.
And Pakistan is using terrorism as a state policy.
while addressing a Chief Ministers conference in new Delhi, Manmohan Singh said that the terrorist elements are backed by neighboring countries specially Pakistan.
And that during the Mumbai attacks the terrorists used the sea route and managed to elude the coast guard.
The Indian Prime Minister said that the Mumbai attacks of November were carried out by Lashkar-e-Taiba.
he added that the terrorists are using modern techniques and the latest communication systems. We'll have to be more rigorous over the line of control where in the intrusion takes place. He said that terrorism will not be spared in any case and this is our policy.
How do you see this accusation of the Indian Prime Minister?
Do the internally opposed and separatist movements of India show the disturbed situation n India?
On whose orders is India taking this warning stance?
Regarding this choice.
Zubair Khan, Karachi
It is extremely sad that the Israelis are openly killing Palestinians. Over here, Kashmir is in the same situation but the Peace Council does not even turn a ear over it.
All the groups that are in Kashmir and Palestine, should keep the war going for freedom, and unitedly fight any force that opposes them. One day their martyrdom will bear fruit, God willing.
Israeli air attacks are still continued on Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
The important leader of Hamas Nazaar Rayyan and family has been martyred.
The Security Council session ended without any decision.
America has opposed the censure resolution against Israel submitted by Lebia and other Arab countries in the session.
Israeli airplanes bombardment is continued since many days on Palestinian civil population.
The whole world reacted on Mumbai attacks but no country including America and England can see bloodshed caused by Israeli attacks.
Why are the major Muslim countries quiet?
What will you wish to say on this double standard of the world.
Saeed, New York
I think the actual point that the majority of our nation in illetrate. They even dont   know where their money is going to. Government  is interested in applying taxes and fullfil their duties. Electricity and Gas shortage will remain same.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The crisis of electricity and gas has worsen in whole of the Pakistan
, on the other hand gas prices have been raised by average 8, while in few cities unavailability of petrol created immense worry for people.
Intense reactions, riots and torturous demonstration are continued in the industrial and business circles of Pakistan against the crisis of electricity and gas.
Industrialist have given an ultimatum before closing the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is perturbed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
Industrial sector is almost paralyzed.
Government Institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other.
Increasing the prices of electricity and gas is not a joke with people?
Why is attention not being paid to solve the problems.
Is government not seeing the full stop on national development?
What immediate steps can you suggest to gain control over this crisis?
Let us know your opinion.
Imran Khokar from Madīnah Munawwarah, “I would like to say that rulers are a reflection of society’s morality.
I am surprised that a government claiming to be people’s friendly is unfriendly to the people.
Non-Availability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a menace.
The government does not have any control over the institutions.
The law and order situation is worsening day by day. May Allah have mercy on the country.
new year has started.
The previous year was a year of protests and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered for terrorism.
It was an end of president Musharraf and end of eight year reign of president Bush, rain of boots on bush and southern rule in Pakistan, Earthquake in Baluchistan, Downfall of economy throughout the world, Heavy marketings
Now a new year has arrived, how do you see the new year?
From your what will be the political and geographical conditions what will be the policy of Obama?
Is there any fast results in end of terrorism?
Will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?
what will be the relations between Indo - pak?
Is there a chance of surgical strike or full scale war?

The one who is taking care of situation gives opinion about it.The people of pakistan open up your eyes and see that you are greatly respected in India.Understand their feelings.
After the Mumbai attack their feeling of hate has increased.Now they are talking against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to foreign news agency the situation has become funny when President Bush along with Prime Minister Noor Almalki in press conference at his office in Baghdad when an Iraqi journalist said to President Bush, ""Dog, this is farewell kiss"".
