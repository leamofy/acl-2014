Thomas Reid who has worked in the Lever national laboratory of America as a Weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the Ex director of technical intelligence at Las Elmos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.
this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.

The Role of EU for peace in the Middle east.
from official point of view, the role of European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
according to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
European Union's spokesman Amadeu Altafaj has said that every such effort is adorable which is helpful in sending the European Union's message to the opponents of the war.
it seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned.
but in reality the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
as the head of the Union, Czech republic's role is even weaker than before.
an on top of that the internal issues have made is helpless.
on the other hand the French president Sarkozy is behaving like if he is still the president of the European Union.
Whereas France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it.
the most funny situation is faced by the French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner.
he is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of Czech republic Schwarzenberg.
the problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the Middle East war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. moreover Germany has sent its special ambassador to Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance, it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.
its proof is the Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.
this is a golden chance for the European Union to do something since America due to the policies of George W. Bush has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial Crisis: Suicide of a billionaire German industrialist.
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany left a huge business group behind him.
but a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 to one Billion Euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle went into deep pressure.
Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had got to this position from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic powet.
After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quick, putting it on new lines.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm, Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have sanctioned 400 million Euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.
this way Merchlay group will stay as it has always been after the death of Adolph Merchley

According to latest statistics the rate of crime among immigrants from 2004 till 2007 is 22%.
Decline from 9 to 0.21%
has reached 4%
According to Interior minister Joachim Herrmann of province Bavaria this is a superficial positive change.

A part from Bavaria the same is being planned in Hamburg.
Senator for foreign affairs from CDU, Christoph Ahlhaus has said: "When research is done in a scientific manner, the man can not pre-decide its results but it is based on the facts and figures that come out as a result of the research.
Ahlhaus diverted the attention to a research report from the anti crime's provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamberg, it was investigated that out of all crimes happening there what percentage have the involvement of foreigners.
results showed that the foreigners here have
the crime rate was less as compared to the crimes allover the province.
in contrast when in 2006 a survey was done on crimes in youth in Berlin, it came up that young people having foreign background had a percentage of .44
was 7 percent
However, other political parties of Germany for example, SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei were against this proposal that while collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired that which German citizen has a foreign background.

Israel, openly kills children, women and civilians and the American president is congratulating them. This is the American humanity and freedom which the world is seeing in Gaza and other places.

Why is there decrease in exercise with increase in age?
New Research.
Exercise is good for health in any age.
This makes your heart stronger, decreases cholesterol levels, helps in reducing weight, helps stop diabetes and decreases the chances of Alzheimer's.

A team of doctors used High Frequency rays to determine the functioning of the heart.
In which, the ability of the heart to pump blood, and it's ability to shrink and relax was researched.
Experts have concentrated mainly on the left side of the heart which is mainly responsible for the pumping of blood.
They discovered that with increase in age, the problems in the rate of heart relaxation also increase.

May God bring people's dialogue pleasantness and bring Barack as blessing to world
Well there is no hope but see what Pakistan-America relationship brings to us in the result of this change
Thats the Wish of martin the king human right activist, who wnated to make the world a peaceful place
The oath taking of Obama as the president of America, whose part of the name is also Hussain, is where historically important in all the ways, is also a great challenge for the history.
Not only for his own self but also for those who supported him with all their hearts.
This challenge will also be for the white majority as it is not easy for them to accept that a colored man is ruling over them.
Here, South Asia, specially Muslims who have expectations from them, should remember that he has been elected as the president of America. And Obama should remember that President of America is actually the President of the entire world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have to have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, so this will be a win for people who love him.
What will be its effect on South Asia and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan.

Dear, whether it is Obama or some one else, the decision of the policy of the entire world is done by Jews lobby of  billionaires, influencing, powerful and effective people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts,the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is in front of everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat, who had a regular Army and Law.
He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a  pact
but it is matter of sorrow that our government treated Swat like a step mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government of the ruler of Swat.
and no interest was taken in the building and development works
The girls who are getting education today are much lesser in number than  those who used to get educated in the previous era.
In the Frontier Province, there is a continuous targeting of educational institutions by Taliban's.
The maximum number of schools have been destroyed in district Swat in which majority are the girls schools.
It is not just this, the Taliban has imposed a ban on girl education.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.
what do you think, by stopping girls' education, what the Taliban want to achieve?
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities so far.
what do you think the government should do.
the question should be that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get.
because the people of Swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them, otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that during the Curfew. How come people can be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing.
when the writ of the government is not being let implemented, how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities?
now the question arises that having an armed force, armed with modern weapons, modern technologies and intelligence system, why the government can not control these few Taliban.
the only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head, that neither their arms end nor they are apprehended.
result of the discussion is that Taliban with their wrong steps are making it easier for the imperialists.
fifteen years before the war was continued in Afghanistan.
ISI is controlling Taliban when at that time opponent was north coalition who was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then suddenly situation changed, actions of Taliban began to appear.
And ISI was also offered Dollars from America so past friends became enemies.
Now situation is this that war continues but helping in Pakistan are still those Iran, India and Russia.
Unless this feeling does not emerge in Human that what is right and wrong till then Human will keep doing mistakes.
As an example a thief when goes to steal if he at that time gets this thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse, there is also punishment in it and he fears from God then that Human will not steal.
Same like this that unless Israel do not gets this apprehension that i am doing wrong and draining blood of innocents and i will get punishment for this, he will keep playing Holi with the blood innocents of Gaza till then.
Respects!
Question is that is war, armed movement, terrorism is solution to problems?
If not then what is the specific prescription which takes to the solution of the problems?
This is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but rather it puts 'blessings' in them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development, that Nelson Mandela had used in South Africa.
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
From the Kashmiris taking part in the elections, it looks as if they have accepted this view point.
It is the third week of Israeli attacks on Gaza and the number of deaths have gone close to a thousand.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date, a ceasefire was not possible.
According to another report, since the start of attacks, on the 27th of December, 90,000 Palestinians have left their homes and moved towards safer locations.
Here, aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, and said that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victim of grave psychological and emotional difficulties.
What do you say?
What should happen?
how is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Taliban should be given a chance
basit, Peshawar
Please wakeup, if the Taliban start doing the real Jihad, then who will kill the innocent people.
Who will burn down the girls' schools?
who will do kidnapping for ransom or if ransom not paid then blame people of being American agents and hang them on the towers?
these Taliban have brought such damage to Islam that no nation or religion has ever brought.
Pashtoon Rore
Kohat, Pakistan
if the whole Muslim world just give a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see that how upset will its father America be.
and immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well.
but what can be done, where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from.
someone tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step as he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
the responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on Arabs and the Muslim world but its and obligation on the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny.
this unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
Just like in Pakistan and India before 30th June or the end of the fiscal year, the government institutions are looted, the American regime just before its end have given a green signal to Israel to do what ever it wants.
On the one hand, America says that a ceasefire will be attempted.
On the other hand, the United Nations is accepting petitions and more petitions, but in reality it's nothing. This means only one thing, that even the United Nations is in on the conspiracy against muslims.
All Muslim nations should disregard the United Nations, and unite under their own weight.
We have a lot of examples in front of us. Where America and United Nations are only passing petitions, the Muslims are bearing the brunt of it.
What is the advantage of these actions when BBC does not have to print anything.
Now, where have the principles of general ism been buried,When the unrequired blood especially of the Muslims starts flowing, at that time the ghost of unbiased reporting starts riding over the BBC.
Otherwise portrays itself as flag bearer of righteousness.
Saying something from their side is a far away thing, they do not want even comments
from the Muslims.
The difference between you and Jews is that they call themselves Jews and Martyr the Muslims and people like you live among Muslims, by calling themselves Muslims, to Muslims
[syja786]
For a long time on BBC forums, sometimes suicide bombing and other times terrorism in India was used to target a certain sect.
The favorite word of these Anti-Islamic discussions was Extremism.
You can get a very good idea, about who an extremist is, from the above discussion in which, writing against Iran was almost considered blasphemy.
When will our muslims understand that Anti Christ can not be fought with swords.
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what shall one do other than crying?
But the basic fault is of this turmoil and massacre which by naming Jihad, we try to blacken the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of Palestinians accepted the existence of Israel then why did Hammas need to fire those rockets on Israel and made suicide attacks?
Attitude of the both the sides is against humanity.
The role of UN and the USA was again seen as favoring towards the injustice of Israel.
May Allah give muslim nation the understanding of becoming  united. Ameen!
and the real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism, after all they are doing the real work.
otherwise, is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are.
so in this situation, in common terms it is called DADAGEERI which means do what ever you can.
That it even hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry.
medicines for injured, and coffins for the dead are being supplied by the Arab leaders and asked that
Should the Israeli attacks take place?
this is the actual problem that the leaders of Muslim countries including Saudi crownprince are in a false sleep, neither they have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
they should take immediate measures against Israel.
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Greetings to all brothers and sisters!
In my opinion, telling Hamas to quit in the name of peace now, would be an injustice to thousands of widows and orphans.
If the Israelites and their supporters are at a rise, then soon Moses shall be born, as this is the law of nature. America and Israel work as gunpowder amongst suicide bombers in Muslims.
The power drunk elephants do not understand this.
Abu Abdulla: Pakistan.
Hamas and Israel should reconcile so that this bloodshed comes to an end.
Muhammad Sarfraz, Paris, France
Absolutely true.
Let’s suppose that Hamas is really the righteous one and they have waged Jihad against the tyranny to become successful in the divine court, even then they should at least realize that if good brings harm to the people then it is of no use
Those who claim to love God, his Messenger, and their religion; it becomes an integral part of their faith to love humanity.
So after muslims, all believers who are living on this earth should be wiped out according to the command of Allah?
Najibur Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
no there are no orders to destroy but to invite them to come to Islam.
but Jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion.
these people should be fought with unless they stop these conspiracies - but this doesn't mean at all that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering.
brothers, the only end to the killer of innocent children is destruction.
but I ask my friends that the Israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past have become so strong today that they don't listen to any one, this is because the Jews are united.
there are no Shea's and Sunnis, there are all just Jews and they have developed everything in every field.
in contrast, what is the condition of 55 Islamic countries?
they are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death.
it is essential that all Muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
and there is no better strategy, that recognize Israel, learn modern education and means of progress and let the world live in peace and harmony.
The Muslims have plenty of land and means as well.
the need is of proper use.
this first most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque and this was impossible without removing Yasin and Arafat from the way.
the world is witnessing that how Palestine had been scattering  after the death of these two leaders.
and how the Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
in 1974 a Pakistani prime minister was so worldly trusted that first time in the history he manged to gather all the Muslim leaders under one roof with hundred percent attendance.
today on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task that the whole nation promise to not only keep unity in its lines
also, while eradicating the differences between other Muslims,  its (The formation of Islamic common wealth) mission will be carried forward
its a monster that has gripped Palestine for half a century.
this monster has many faces.
many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
and its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
this monster is most unhappy with Islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through Islam, Muslims, the perfect religion of Muslim and Practical Islam as the history tells that Islam has put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since 27th of December.
more that 3 hundred Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
after the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
however the Israeli authorities say that they will continue operation in Gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
in your opinion, is this claim of Israel true that it's doing all this for defending the sovereignty of Israel?
is the world community playing its role in such situation?
does this aggression has an indirect relation with the coming elections in Israel?
can any improvement be expected in the situation in Middle East after the succession of the newly elected American president Barak Obama.

BBC publishes these kind of comments after deep search.
after all a neutral impression is to be maintained.
although the news from BBC are usually correct but the real thing is the style of the news.
what should be pointed out and what news should be given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
in this art now a days the Pakistani electronic and print media, specially some Urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone, who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the "grudge of Muavia" written on them.
has said that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. how long this hypocrisy will continue.
Why are the Muslims tortured that much, if the American people stop favouring Jews then as God said that they would live worst lives, so Americans, u stop favouring them and then see their fate
All these world renowned leaders and people who murder innocents in the name of peace should realize that peace in the world can only be achieved by justice, and not through injustice or wiping entire races.
If killing a particular race off completely is the answer, then Hitler's plan would not have seen any jews survive, and definitely not seen their rise.
Says a poet
Injustice is injustice. If it breeds, it dies.
Blood is blood. If it bleeds, it dries.
How can anyone define terrorism?
Isn't all this terrorism too? Why does only ones pain seem painful?
Aren't other people human too? So why is only Muslim blood so important? Wasn't all the innocent people's blood red too?
So why are there no disapproval messages now?
I watched the Mumbai attacks investigations like the fire was in my own home. I cannot watch this human suffering. Can't everyone else see this suffering? I wish Muslims all over could come together and think about this.
Dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood, how shall we condemn, I can not find words!
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims that on one side people are being killed in India so the rest of the world comes over Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations otherwise we will do it ourselves!
And on the other side, Israel is killing generations of muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent. This is unbearable!
There is delay but not NEVER in the house of God and only then will this darkness shed. Then
The threat to Israeli sovereignty is a joke as long as it has America's backing.
As far as elections are concerned, it is not surprising that the people who are in power do such things to win the heart and mind of people especially in a state like Israel. And speaking of Barak Obama, history shows that no American president has wavered from the policy and will not do so in future. A tyrant is a tyrant whether he is white or black.
The debate going on in the forum makes it clear that every one is sad on Benazir's death but as a politician, one can not ignore her mistakes.
This talk requires debate that whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was so dear then  why was it left in 10 year dictatorship of Musharaf until American clearance and the deal.
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the stratocracised public needed her, unfortunately she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised.
No one is going to say anything about the way that this historical figure is being falsely accused.
Sana Khan.
Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them.
One more writer.
Sir/Madam, maybe if you read not only the history of Pakistan, but of it's neighboring four countries, or of seven other countries, then you might understand the meaning of Mr. Psycho.
Tariq Abbas
One whose nature is wrong cannot be taught.
For reflection in water is not always clear.
Britain never let them become one, and invented the hindu-muslim friction which was taken ahead by sir Syed.
Psycho.
So relentless is our nation, that they are blind when writing poetry for their parties, but no one says anything when our historical figures are battered and falsely accused.
We have progressed enough.
Sana Khan.
Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey doesn't become a scholar if you put books on him.
although after the Mumbai attacks, there has been a setback in the dialog between Pakistan and India, however Pakistan and India should continue these dialogs.
if we talk of war then it will bring loss of humans from both sides.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu but on the other hand when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader; point to be noted.
First of all Mary Christmas to Mr. Bhana and to all the Christian brothers of the forum.
greeting to all friends of the Forum: Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, sister Sana, sister Shahida and Mr. Akram.
We want flowers of peace rather in the flame of war.
War is itself a problem.
What solution will the war give?
Today will give Fire and blood.
Tomorrow will give hunger and necessity.
For this wise people
it is better that war keeps postponing.
In your and our garden
it is better that candle keeps lit.
The relationship of India America have become deep and India knows that when the time comes America will openly deceive Pakistan.
this is also the old history of America.
in case of and Indian attack, America would get its goals and the expense would be on India as well.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation and ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
this is the Islamic history.
even before this resolution the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it more clever that effected and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has relaxed its pressure now.
while ignoring India's unnecessary bobbery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a "Side Effect" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
there are no two opinions over this that it is a heinous act.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past one year?
How many Taliban are killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday?
I appeal to the I.S.I that for God's sake, stop monitoring the Taliban and let us live in peace in our heavenly hometown Sawat.
And stop this phony operation.
That day is not far when a resolution about Pakistan's military intervention will be passed by United Nations just like the bill which was passed against Jamat-ud-Dawah.
Riaz Ahmad Farooqi
The extremists of our country and their supporters themselves are constantly providing all evidences and justifications required for instigation of action against them, and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is passed, in all likelihood not a single voice would be raised in United Nations, in our favour.
And supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.
We are not aware and familiar with the character and achievements of Pir Sami-ullah and what his activities were.
Maybe he was not a revolutionist.
Like the deadbodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, Doctor Najeebullah and thousands of other revolutionists have been subjected to dishonour at the hands of the enemy.
They are immortal even after they die.
But there is a international game being played here in which place public is ruled by frightening through barbarism and ferociousness.
So that license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will clutch the government.
These acts of so called Islamic activists on the name of religion is without limit worthy of condemnation.
These supporters of extremists can see the injustice of America but instead of expressing grieve on those dishonest acts they clearly shun them by giving them name of tribal traditions.
Sometimes by cloaking in tribal traditions, sometimes on the name of Islam, any pious man cannot give reason for such dishonest acts.
In my view, our Army people are associated with theses people.
As such that when these people move from a place then it takes such time that they can be caught, there should be time for that but its a stretch that they get there on time even if they are there, they are long gone.
Are they so merciless that they kidnap fifty seventy men and our Army putting hand on hand looks at them like a spectator.
They are servant of Allah and  so is Army.
It is very clear that there is fishy.
instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and lesson gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell,
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Who burnt the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on the refusal of oath after the Prophet (PBUH) passed away and how took her husband by the rope in his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
without accepting reality neither the motives can be diminished nor correction can be made.
O' BBC please stop this dual-headed policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
please show some modesty, a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office.
the success of, operation Sherdil and across the border operation Lion heart, depends on the fact that in whose favor is the opinion of general public.
this act is of American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahab is a victim of this conspiracy.
all discussions on this forum will now be anti Taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined Taliban and they are doing what can change the public opinion.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public. They even report something like this 'Bombing on Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000, in Swat went there to do.
That the bodies of the Taliban who helps the army is left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake stop this drama.
These Talibans have tarnished the Muslim image.
If in the whole world true Muslims don't call these terrorists as Muslims then how come these elements are able to live in the lands of true Muslims.
Those who become shameless, can't do hard labor they pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
Its need is neither in any religion nor in any customs.
All media including BBC gives thier views about taliban and tribal areas by different resources
But nobody knows what the actual situation is. It is we who know about it because we are tribals.
In short this is a game in which CIA, RAW, MUSAD, and our own ISI is involved.There is nothing like taliban or tribal people, they are the negative elements created by these institutions who are spoiling the name of Islam, Taliban, Religous institutes, Pukhtoon nation and Tribals.
This move has ashamed all the Muslims.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that current leadership will end this  cancer.
After Mumbai attacks India said that some extremists are behind the attacks.
Pakistan rejecting the accusations said that it will help India in investigation in every possible way.
India said that it has given a list to Pakistan that has 20 suspected extremists required by India.
Now Pakistan has said that included in the list Jaish-e-Muhammad's Molana Azhar Masood is not in custody and government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before that the president of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari refuted the view that west's secret agencies and Indian government has given evidence related to Mumbai attachs.
President Zardari has said that it has not been proved that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani.
During this, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that the its relations with India are not going to improve until its land is continued to be used for terrorism.
And in latest development, Indian Cricket team has cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should sports be effected due to these political events?
What future to you see of India Pakistan Relationship?
Pakistan will not be torn apart by America or India.
It will be torn apart by Pakistani themselves.
What can you expect after so much internal segregation and rivalry?
However, Jinnah didn't do well with the Muslims from India, and time has already proven that.
Yasmin: Chicago.
Madam, if Jinnah's work was carried forward, then these internal cancer of segregation and rivalry would not have spread, and the muslims in India wouldn't be in the situation they are in now.
It's our fault that after him, no other leader could stand in his shoes.
But if we can't appreciate our heroes, then....
This sector does have a lot of abilities.
God knows when they will come to their senses and use the blessing of unity to make some progress.
Both countries have priests, Shiv sena, RSS etc. that constantly oppose peace.
And these negative forces do not want the sector to make any progress, hence the countries are kept on their toes.
Can you imagine the status of this place in the world for Pakistan, India and China, with just a little bit of unity?
Pakistan is cursed by God for having robbers and thieves as their appointed leaders.
may Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
but Sir, open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
Other than that National matter are not looking good as well, circumstances in Sarhad, Balochistan, Karachi in Sindh are in front of you.
In this situation country needs a such leader who can unite us as a single Nation.
O Allah Have mercy on us
In my opinion there is no way other than a last war.
Enough much has happened
Now this affair has to win or lose.
This problem will not solve with hypocrisy deceit.
And neither with small big terrorism in each other countries.
Even Europe too came to rest after fighting the last great war.
And if this Great war had not happened then they all would be chattering like Pakistan and India.
Almost all of our political parties are agreed on the fact that terrorism and sectarianism should be rooted out of the country.
But our military leadership does not seem sincere in this regard. On one hand they assure America and Europe that they are with them in this war against terror and on the other hand are covertly aiding the Taliban.
We should now ponder and set our direction and choose one path only. Thanks
There is no doubt that the majority of the movement league are from the Tayaba Group, who joined the league after the inception of Pakistan.
However, after that,  this leagues obstructed aid campaigns, and now on India's insistence, United Nations has declared them as the enemy and even the Government of Pakistan is cracking down on them.
In my opinion, if these Jihadi groups quit this religious fanaticism, and try helping instead, then it would be better for all.
The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan are employing professional criminals in the name of Jihad, the mentors of these and the mullahs are the same people who called Pakistan, Paleedistan and what not from time to time.
They are not letting any stone unturned in the destruction of Pakistan.
They do not deserve to be called humans let alone muslims.
Without rooting these miscreants out of Pakistan, the national security will be at risk.
Is there still room for consideration whether these scoundrels should be banned?
There is no place in this world for extremist mullahs whose only purpose is to kill.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What kind of world is this where it is hard to live for one who takes the name of one major pillar of Islam,  religion of Allah.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims but when Muslims even try to take revenge, all our hypocrite leaders together with all the non-muslim world treat people with the true and right pain of religion just like our great leader Hafiz Saeed is being treated today.
India in impunity of Bombay attacks.
Pakistan relation are bitter. Better relationship as a result of last few years between the two countries have been jolted  greatly.
India has always held the military and non-military groups in Pakistan responsible.
And bringing relationship back on track is being conditioned by operations against these groups.
For as much, Indian security departments have held Lashkher-e-Tayyaba responsible for the Bombay attacks.
In this case, name of Jamat-ud-Dawa has come in the front many times.
This is the first time that relation between both the countries have worsen due to a terrorist activity in India
In December 2001, after the attacks on Indian Parliament, these two neighbors were on the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
Now Jamat-ud-Dawa, about which Security analysts say that it is in reality a new face of Lashker-e-Tayyaba. Restrictions on the party are being requested.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan do decisive operations against extreme activists on its land?
By banning Jamat-ud-Dawa, can  current Pak-India crisis be over?
crisis be over? and how important is it to close down the armed groups to keep constant peace between both countries?
Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly?
Will the Peace Council never show any alertness against the Muslims every time?
For this it is said that when the accuser is lazy the witness is active.
If seen India itself has become one useless realm.
Whose intelligence, army and other security officials has become useless, who for 72 hours have danced the dance of mole with terrorists and India is cheating the world by blaming Pakistan over its uselessness.
If one disbeliever dies then the whole world knows about it- why is this double accuracy?
To the dear nation of one nonpolitical, religious, farming organization...
Farqaan Farooq, Faisalabad
Until our Prophet(Peace be upon Him), great ancestors and Sufism gave the human beings the love and respect, religion Islam was more vast growing and ripening from peace and sparkle.
The Muslims also got promoted in every field.
But when this beautiful Religion rose to the hands of distillation then within the human beings began the difference of religious and disbeliever and the new gateways of pride and prejudice began to open by which the world was unknown before.
Salam- Please do it with pleasure but act at your own.
do not do it under American pressure.
if India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
And why it accuses us of every thing?
there are extremist groups and organizations in India as well, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the world?
What India is doing in Kashmir, what is that?
What Israel is doing, what is that?
the truth is; we are the first Nuclear Muslim State and why; this is the main issue.
Pakistan is now in it's last stages.
Kamran Hassan: Abu Dhabi
Your words touch the heart, and the situation seems so.
Now in American publications, the new map of Pakistan is being printed, and all these restrictions are now apparent in the series of events.
The Americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over Pakistan.
In this situation, if we do not stand together and show our unity, then remember, if Bangladesh can be made, then anything can happen.
Terrorist attacks should be condemned to the maximum, whether they are on the Mumbai Hotel or the Marriot Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine.
Similarly, terrorists should be hunted down irrespective of their nationality and whether they are Pakistani, Indian, American or Israeli.
Now the question is that every day terrorist attacks take place in Pakistan, hundreds of people die but the Pakistani officials along with the rest of the world stay silent.
Wasn’t the attack on the Marriot Hotel an act of terrorism?
then why-
hale to the advisor for interior Rehman Malik, how brave and bold has the gentleman become.
no imgage
not only this, but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under 'someones's pressure'.
wow, all praise to the Almighty!
whether having the ability or not or to say that I don't want.
We, the Pakistanis are fighting whose war.
and why we have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect.
No one has  a right to interfere anyone's national affairs.
The colonial system is apparently not there.
If people expect justice, or demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan, which I think is not acceptable by those calling for unity.
Pakistan is always following European and American purposes.
This goes on without the approval of many of its citizens.
And it invokes hostile sentiments.
If you believe in the United States of America, then why not just give up your place and leave honorably?
Pakistan has the ability to be armed or unarmed.
In Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, security forces captured a proved camp of practically non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India's accusation is that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Minister, Condoleeza Rice told the Pakistani leadership that there should be immediate action taken against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack.
It is their claim that without a doubt, the extremists who carried out the Mumbai attacks used Pakistani land.
In the meanwhile, officials in Peshawar claim that the lot of trucks which carry supplies to the united forces in Afghanistan was burnt by unidentified armed people, because of which more than 50 trucks were destroyed.
This is the second attack in Peshawar on NATO and American supplies in the last 48 hours.
In the meanwhile, Pakistan captured an established camp of the almost inexistent Lashkar-e-Taiba. Previously, lots of efforts were carried out to try to disarm armed groups all the way from Karachi to the tribal regions, which included giving compensation to those who returned their weapons and even ascertaining them that no action would be taken against them.
The situation is telling us that the efforts undertaken in the regime of General Ziyaul Haqq, after the previous Soviet Union's interference in Afghanistan to get rid of the armed groups that formed as a result of the resistance that started through American and Saudi funding, and to bring an environment similar to that before 1980 were not successful.
The question is what does Pakistan want to do?
Does Pakistan have the ability to do so?
What do you say?

I have only one question for the standard bearers of the world.
If you kill their children, will they come to garland you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill innocent public, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in negative, then you really need to fix your viewpoint.
The people were armed when there was the fear that Russia would head towards Pakistan after finishing Afghanistan, and that is why they were supplied arms.
Now, when there is the fear that America will capture Pakistan, via Afghanistan, as the president American president has clearly mentioned in his presidential mission, why should we disarm them now?
Only so that after defeating the American or Indian army, it does not have to face any resistance from the public?
Yes, if any of them are guilty of being involved in any destructive work, Pakistan can take action against them alone.
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
And another question is that were these terrorists not supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the present terrorism is in no way connected to it.
It must be remembered that Hafiz Saeed is the first 'Jehadi leader' who called the Taliban actions 'mischief'.
I am sure that the Taliban effect is a inseparable result of American plans, and hence every person who can stand in the way of Taliban must be removed.
Despite the support of the whole nation, the fact that Zardari and co. took action against the Lashkar is a clear sign of their frigid and kiss-up nature.
To stop the project that is running on Saudi-American funding, they must be requested themselves to regather, for God's sake, the filth that has polluted our society.
One should also protest against them that according to what ethics, America and Saudi Arabia distributed dangerous weapons and named Jihadis but in the reality spread the virus of hateful literature and culture. Due to which slaughter houses were open in our country.
After the threat of an attack from the Indian side, an announcement from the Pakistan Army that they would pull their troops from the Afghan Border and would commit them towards India and a declaration from Taliban that they would take care of the Afghan Border, staggered the Americans badly and thus put all their weight behind Pakistan against an Indian attack.
This exposed the might of the American Army in the region.
Although India neither made any threat of an attack nor she had the courage to do so.
In addition, attacks of Taliban on the American supply lines proved to be the final nail in the coffin.
Thus, it was proved that without the help of Pakistan Government and Army, America would achieve nothing.
Karachi is Pakistan's business and economic center and Dubai of the less privileged areas.
Hundreds of thousands do not return empty handed from here. But since the law was enforced on the western borders, Karachi has taken all the attention.
Now they are looking to kidnap this city.
For the first time Pathan's are called Pashtoons. They are made to fight by making them strangers to each other. Although the need is to be united.
One possible solution to the problem is this that either Urdu speaking learn Pashto or Pashto speaking learn Urdu, or whats better is they all learn English.
You will surely think this as a ridiculous suggestion but do you think that reason of this conflict is not ridiculous?
That reason of violence is language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir i gave this suggestion  in childhood in reality to my friends in which there were people according to classification from every religion and dialect but friends used to laugh on my talks.
At that time the condition of Jinn of hatred of dialectal and religious was not that alive and strong but it was brewing internally.
Do not understand what and why is this happening?
Are these the very same signs of Last day?
For what crime are innocent and guiltless being killed?
The reasons are in front of everyone who wants to divide Pakistan in pieces same are active here and who do this they neither have religion and nor country.
Whether it is Karachi or Bombay, our homes are burnt with their own lamps( we  have destroyed our homes ourselves)
When the government comes, they just change names of the places to build a name for themselves. Just like these days airports, roads, buildings are all named Benazir.
What has happened in Karachi, is this what Benazir means?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awaken sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
Where reaction full of patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties have taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time they have also given American planners one more chance to think.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the turmoil in Karachi and management is showing self interest.
Management can control the situation in 1 hour but it is being given wind on purpose.
Pressure of political parties on police and rangers keeps them from doing the operation.
Talks of getting united are only limited to statements, political parties should let go of their self interests and work for the interest of a common man.
until there is pressure on the administration, these kind of incidents will keep taking place.
I think these people are the biggest terrorists.
and foreign powers are definitely involved in this but no one knows who they are?
but alas that if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there, but since its not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
the government should operate here and save a large and very important city of the country from terrorism
otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
BBC Urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure and Pakistani media's condition is already weak.
the whole truth is there on BBC English.
one solution to the problem is that either Urdu speakers should learn Pushto or Pushto speaking learn Urdu or better if every body learns English.
you will definitely take is as a funny suggestion but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
The reason for persecution may be language ?
Another story of murder has finally been published in Karachi, which was being dreaded by all the citizens for a long time.
The criminals do not let go any opputunity of a crime. The news reports and the media are only telling 50% of what actually happened here in 4 days.
Have spent the last three nights without sleeping, and the fear is still there.
Those who make the people evacuate hotels, those who kill the shoe-makers and the peanut-sellers.
Those who rob and kill at the Super Highway, and cut off the ears of innocent citizens, they are ignorant of the wrath of Allah which will eventually entrap them.
What could be the reasons of this sudden turmoil in your opinion?
(B.B.C)
Keeping in view, the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai, we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in Karachi. It is simple and easy to guess that the turmoil is just due to an unconcious trade of blood.
Obviously if somebody infuriates a father, it would not be surprising if the son reacts violently.
the blood of the loyalists of Liaqat Ali Khan also belonged to the same place but to eliminate Mr. Psycho's misunderstanding I am writing this verse.
we will also repeat our elders' traditions
we made it by sacrificing lives and will save it by doing the same
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
it is very disappointing that whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
see Liaqat Ali Khan, you will will find out that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family from Karnal in Punjab.
due to his steps for the migrants, today the migrants consider him as one of them.
there is always a reaction to every action.
one can afford on oneself but.
Ejaz Aiwan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan, they did not face any reaction.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
One Muslim League N was left, even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q have made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment in the National Assembly and the Senate.
Till now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why  no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part that is they will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft, government speaker did not take any action.
MQM coalition partner of government, Muslim League N an underhand ally of government and Muslim league Q the party to approve the seventeenth amendment then how is it possible that these parties can be sincere to approve the disapprove amendment.
its just like writing your name amongst shaheeds by just putting color on yourself.
Peoples Party anyway is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment.
How would one think of getting his own hands cut.
as long as Zardari is the president, seventeenth amendment is not going to be cancelled.
this is an opinion of a majority in our survey and so is the truth.
if the seventeenth amendment was to be cancelled then Zardari would never had become the president.
Now he is even more powerful that president Musharaf as along with being the president he is also the chairman of the Peoples party.
as long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.
in order to cancel the seventeenth amendment, the political parties will first have to dismiss president Zardari from the presidency.
neither MQM wants this nor other parties.
Most elders of our family belonged to labor class.
And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.
To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.
Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.
From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.
But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.
We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.
It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God
This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.
It was not even 30 minutes for us working that our younger son said “Dad it feels like I am not born for this job.
We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.
Son started saying that I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work .
Three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home.
What it means is that when a man decides the destination no matter what were the motives behind this no one can stop him from getting it.
But if you don’t even know what you have to do then God be with you.
It is said that do not say bad about the dead. But what shall we do, we see only bad things in Benazir even on her first death anniversary.
Benazir, for her selfish purpose, crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs after giving the list of their names who were fighting for freedom on one hand and on the other gave India the chance to keep its full attention on Kashmir after them helping to suppress Punjab Movement.
Tug of war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history, which has pushed the country back many years.
Benazir continued to give negative comments on Kashmir and the nuclear program after being exiled.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
during her rule, Benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make as much money that is why he is known as Mr. Ten percent.
during Benazir's rule his brother got killed but his murderers are still safe from any punishment.
besides being a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
just like Benazir did her politics over her fathers dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came into power twice but she could not punish her the culprits of her father's political murder even she couldn't register a case against them.
it has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
what should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated 16th December as a didactic day and take such measures that this kind of incident don't take place again.
on this day we could send greeting to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again.
the rulers would reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Bahari's stuck in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines of life from the next day.
Only if East and West Pakistan could be one together just like East and West Germany was united once again.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be granted in the near future.
When it was announced in the news today that the Governor of the American State Illinois was arrested for corruption charges
and when the State Congress started getting ready to remove him from the position of the governor as soon as possible, then there is this one American companion who has a close watch on the circumstances of Pakistan, boastfully claimed to us that this is what we call democracy.
In America, even the higher level people can not transcendence the law.
and there is your country Pakistan whose president has been elected after dropping of corruption charges.
my sense of humor woke and I said that what's wrong if a governor got arrested in America, in Pakistan, once we arrested the Prime Minister overnight and hanged him and the second time we exiled one.
tell me when it happened in America?
Pakistan sent off the lawbreaker with guard of honor from the presidency, tell me when did such thing happened it America?
In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was suspended in such a way that besides the public support he has not be restored so far, did it ever happened in America?
Holder of a fake degree was made the minster for health in Pakistan, did it ever happen in America?
after hearing all this the American went down laughing and then conceded defeat.
in this picture, president Zardari is smiling despite of being surrounded by the Americans from all four sides.
it looks from his smile
He is thinking that America is supporting his government but he is forgetting that a year ago they were with Pervez Musharaf.
This picture has been taken as it was a family gathering
A photo like this was never published in the papers before; one president with three American officials.
It seems the American involvement in Pakistan has increased and more than one official is needed to do the job; or they are not relying on their new puppet the way they relied on the one before him.
This could also have been arranged keeping in mind the stories of President Zardari’s breach of commitments.
If it had been a sensible ruler, at least he would not have been grinning during the photo session and he would have had a subservient and embarrassing look on his face.
If the principle of democracy is applied on this picture then Present Zardari is in minority.
In democracy, majority rules the country and the picture reveals the actual rulers.
The scenic Swat valley is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
The government’s policy so far is to engage in talks besides the use of force.
But the use of force is achieving nothing other than strengthening the Taliban and increase in public sympathies for them.
what needs to be done is that the government, instead of using the power, should eliminate the causes of the issue.
by eliminating the causes Fazlullah and Taliban will automatically finish.
the Sharia bill proposed by ANP will become the solution of the problems of Swat to a great extent.
But besides implementation of the Sharia, the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues.
from the early steps of General Musharaf, it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians, but the lust of power changed all his plans.
all the hopes were from the participation in the "war of terror", he had started considering himself as immortal.
those steps which were expected, all broke-off.
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, he made a deal with the thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army but never know what's happening to the present government.
Either its Bajor or Swat, the army does not control terror but bombs the "Enemy" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy a mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy.
The conditions in the  terrorism struck area Swat in the Frontier Province are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area
On the one side the governments writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side the effect of Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everday in Swat.
On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.
The result is that on the one side the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other hand the Taliban has established their hold.
In between who got grinded, the poor citizens.
It is said that in Swat somebody asked, which type of people are the Taliban's are? The answer was  "very good people because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country".
Then asked how is Army, the answer was that the Army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.
Then it was asked, who are the enemies of religion and country, the answer was "the citizens"
I am astonished, how the Pakistan Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban's.
Could not track down Taliban's illegally operated FM channel which in my opinion is very easy.
But still FM was spreading hatred in full swing.
After girls schools now boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfew is imposed so that tablibans can move around easily.
Tonight 8 trucks entered the suburbs of Mingora during curfew and created bunkers.
The question is that how could they reach there during curfew.
Army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house and salutes Taliban.
For God sake someone tells this Army to protect helpless people of Sawat from Taliban and prove that Pakistan army can overcome any enemy.
He says that most of the blood is spilt in the name of religion, tell me that if religion was not then blood wouldnt have spilt?
Punjabi, Pathan, White and Blank, Mehsood and other tribes, are these the products of religion?
No! No way! Sir, religious is what teaches that no one is black or white, punjabi or muhajir otherwise if religion was not present, then half world would have vanished for the war between white and black and other half fighting over the status and sect.
Actually, religion gives moral teachings to the man. And binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here. And he should spent his life according to his rules.
As a muslim, I have total faith that Islam is complete way of life and a true religion.
After moving to London, I used to call my relatives back home every single morning, although they never called us even once. Then I realized they were inconvenienced by our calling as well, so we stopped.
After living in France now for two years, I feel the same way.
I don't know why people always expect us to call them.
A resolution passed about Iraq in a few hours, Darfar has absolutely no problem in sending peace army.
Bombay attacks were condemned in no time and banning dubious groups is only a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are doing consensus.
O caretakers of international peace! life is finishing here!
is it really being waited to diminish.
so that any again no aggrieved could even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights.
when a father is running carrying his beloved sons dead body, even then your hearts don't pinch you with pain?
If not then you don't even deserve to be called human being.
but you are a black mottle over the name of humanity.
so atleast this has been proven that this region has also been a homeland for Jews for centuries.
ideally these two nations should have lived in harmony but since their strings are in Western and Arab hands, so without their will peace can not prevail in this region.
and now even Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
even if the Israeli operation stops temporarily, it will start again any moment after any incident.
BBC's own country has its interests related to America and Israel and this is why while taking cover of enlightened moderation, it has started a series of blogs or Jewism and doing a biased propaganda.
BBC is just doing formality and to gain sympathy is their only purpose and wish!
mr moderator is requested that he may publish the commentry by this humble soul so that one can guess BBC still has some integrity left.
Thankyou.
who knows about the author and the origin of this story but the fact remains, in every era draculas have fed on innocent blood.
Every era has seen war as well as blood shed.
surprisingly twenty first century man who considers himself very civilized is silent over this murder done publically in the day light.
how can he not realize that whatever is happening is showing the ugliest face of humanity

well wisher, Sajjad ul Hasnain, Hyderabad Dakan
At this time along with Dera Ghazi Khan, in whole country winter rains are goin on.
here is a poem according to the weather, enjoy the weather along with this poem.
These rains are with your presence.
if it rains, its spring
if it stays then its peace
sometimes comes without a reason
at times spread over day and night
sometimes very noisy and sometimes very quiet
These rains are with your presence.
in a memory, at a night
to a buried ash
Sometimes it was such, that the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burnt itself.
Sometimes each drop seems sorrowful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What is it to them, whether the country lasts or not.
Whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them.
For one, our media is also corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government, and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday afternoon something surprising happened.
All together police running here and there but not ask on illegal parking
and moreover that NYPD traffic was also not in a mood to look at illegal parked cars.
it happened like this that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in Hudson river.
Till now it is just known this that "Terrorists" relation was with birds race Goose.
Yesterday was maybe New York's historic cold
Temperature do not drop to this degree
Me my own jaw is beginning to hurt after half hour of stroll outside.
Imagine that what would have happened to those people who jumped from plane in the river.
Happy news is that people all together stayed safe
and sad news is that ship of company sank in this financial crisis.
I went by West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I still do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, in my one hour trip, the way had opened at least a bit, so I was able to get the 56th street exit.
Otherwise, I had not taken the previous two exits, seeing the lines waiting at them.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women
Shaguftah: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I have slaughtered two chickens and how they are slaughtered, Jahanzeb has already mentioned.
Apart from this, there is no other way.
At this farm, one has to get his own meat done,, including removing the skin.
Basim: .Net might take some to repair.
what happened on the forum?
Linko
in order to work with Listen to Blog, see it in Fire Fox.
Duffer: same to you, Eid Greetings to you.
Sir please use Fire Fox.
the snow will vanish.
we unnecessarily kept thinking of these Taliban of Swat as indelicate but who were only unhappy over women's education.
they kept expressing their grief by demolishing a women's school and college somewhere every day.
but just like other ideas, this idea did not also come true, according to this report by CNN, today on the sacred day of Monday this Taliban gang of Swat have blasted a boy's school.
Swat, The Taliban has destroyed a boys school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Amen, then Amen.
Masha Allah, up till now, 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom of fixing marriages before birth among Muslims, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See a picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
just a while before this, the wedding of a dog with a girl took place.
look at that groom.
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
it is the era of computers and its involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life.
many people have many reservation over this increasing involvement of computer, for example, in financial matters.
where use of credit card bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
so now only through your financial matters like through your credit card, you can be located.
and in future when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent, its benefits will increase more and more.
similarly in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, the credit card information is stolen.
similarly computers have become the source of friendship.
Social networking sites, like Orkut, Facebook and Myspace are at first level of acceptance.
But do you not think that the more we are following these social networking sites, the further we are getting from people in real life?
Similar are the match making websites, where your desires are matched with others desires and you are shown a list of the people who match with you.
But can you lead a life with a person who is just like you?
I can not, and that is why the spouse is called the better half,
because he/she will get rid of the faults within me.
Perhaps I received a lesser share of wisdom.
From childhood, I thought of everything as being true if it was told by an elder.
In the same way, I was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world.
I was even ridiculed a lot on this
But only that saying seemed true which could be possible.
Become much irritation because what was the reason to tell lie?
Bore loss on that saying even at this age
So it is my effort to say lie the very least.
Do not misguide someone by lieing and that also by attaching Allah's name.
and Allah willing say only when there is pray to Allah that work completes.
Remaining Allah knows better the state of intention.
This is a disgusting problem which is created due to reason of distance from religion.
According to law of both our Pakistan and religion, minor child should stay with mother.
Their expense is due to their father and father can meet with children.
then when they become mature, they live with whom they wan to live.
You are right that the actual problem are the relatives who misguide.
feudalism has overshadowed our deeds.
Even here is thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in father's property so it is resisted, although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated.
here these restriction regarding making of relations have created many evils in the society.
concept of remarriage of a divorced or a widow is getting rare.
due these unnecessary beliefs and tradition the family system is facing disarray.
in our society, if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarry, then why it is not appreciated?
there is a Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago, now after getting all his children married when he married a widow, his own children have gone against him.
In my opinion, this is religious right, what do you say?
What type of mentality is the 'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place', kind of mentality?
In my opinion the children of this person should think that after having married all the kids, is there anything wrong in his marrying a widow?
This way the widow gets a caretaker and uncle also gets someone who will take care of his home.
Because his children would certainly be busy in their worldly affairs and would not be having time for him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow if their wives refuse to look after them, when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society, which we are facing for the last 40-50 years.
It is acceptable for a wife that her husband does unlawful actions but she does not let him marry another woman.
If its in her power, she will not let him do so even after she dies.
Destroys her afterlife along with her husbands'.And also lets spreading of the immorality in the society.
Nothing happens with singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.
And about your question, when sir instead of bringing his wife home, goes to someone else's wife so the dependents just make a fuss for the show and stay quiet and satisfied. ( yeah, later the relatives of the wife get angry)
In the Indian subcontinent, we accepted Islam centuries ago but we could not let go of this illiterate thinking and always thought of culture and tradition as more valuable than Islam.
Considering man's 2nd marriage as ridiculous, divorce as denigration, divorced as untouchable, love marriage as dishonor and considering a man marrying an older women is dissimulation of the women is only the result of this way of thinking.
And over all, by copying the western world, we are declaring the religious and veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam was easy, getting rid of this way of thinking is very hard.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Amen
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.
Century passed writing such little writing
Know that little is much.
Allah Hafiz
Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes that i found this secret in my life that if leader of any Army is in front line then that Army will never lose.
But here situation is else.
To say that Common people are there to die for us if we die then martyr
if someone from common people dies then murder
May peace and blessing of Almighty be upon you.
I was coming back to my shop after the Isha prayer tonight, a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called.
I thought that probable this man has lost his way or wants to ask something, I stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car.
he asked me if I could speak and understand Arabic, I said no problem, you tell me what's up?
he started telling that he has come from Riyadh and here in Medina someone picked my pocket, kindly help me. I said please go away brother, since such an incident has already taken place with me that I gave this man 12 riyals so that he could reach Riyadh, but he started doing the same after moving a little farther.
I was furious, I cursed him and threatened him of the Police, then he ran away.
this is the situation of Muslims now that even for begging we ride our cars along with our families and make at least 2 to 3 thousand a day.
However there is a clear Hadith (SAAW) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one.
May Allah bless us and make us true Muslims (Amen)

Wife of famous singer Adnan Sami, reached a police station in Bombay accusing him of torturing her.
The police station suggester her to contact Court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Guladari submitted a plea against her husband that Adnan Sami tortures her continuously.
and treats her inhumanely.
Now this has exceeded her tolerance limit therefore a case should be recorded against Adnan Sami.
Police instead of recording a report suggested that she should contact the court by saying that this matter is not what comes under police control.
In your opinion, is the accusation of Adnan Sami's wife on him is correct?
What if this accusation is an attempt of tarnishing the name of Adnan Sami?
Let us know of your comments regarding this matter.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
as far as allegations are concerned, anyone can post it on someone else.
nothing comes before prestige.
however may be the relations between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he left his respectful life and went to India to make money and now this fame has caught him badly.
this is a consequence of his own deeds.
Washington...
top American officials say that president Obama will take strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
in the new American policy over Afghanistan, there is more emphasis on war than development.
officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achievement of American goals Since in his government, there is corruption, drugs business has increased and Taliban are regaining their power.
American officials say that people, who are putting more pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more, include vice president Joe Biden and President Obama's representative for Afhanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke.
They stated that the policy change came after President Bush left office, who used to have video conferencing with Hamid Karzai fortnightly and emphasized the American role in the rebuilding of Afghanistan and its civil institutions.
The Obama administration will work with provincial political leaders instead of the central government.
They said that they will ask Hamid Karzai to intensify the campaign against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing new elections this year and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his administration are going to back him up in the presidential race.
Does this statement reflect a shift in American policy towards Afghanistan?
Is Hamid Karzai’s era coming to an end?
What is your say on this?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and SriLanka, Srilanka defeated Pakistan with 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Srilanka in the first one-day match although Srilanka won in the next two matches.
In this third one-day match, the nation's team performance was very poor. They worn out in only 75 runs in 23 overs against 309 runs made by the national team of Srilanka.And this is how we faced a lesson learning defeat.
the result of the series proves that the National team has no consistency in its performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
which departments of the game should be addressed more by the authorities?
are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
which department you will hold responsible for the defeat, fielding, batting or bowling?
please provide your feedback.
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish  traditions continue. these feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule, who would call them Muslims?
a Sardar should walk himself over these embers. why the present government do not act against them?
when the judicial justice will come in handy.
Sir Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan for playing one day international series.
Visit of a foreign team to Pakistan, in spite of Pak India tension is a good sign.
On reaching Karachi Airport the Sir Lankan team was given a warm welcome.
Two matches will be held between Pakistan and Sir Lanka in Karachi while the third one will be played in Lahore.
Both teams are asserting highly regarding their batting, bowling and fielding.
If Siri Lanka venerates its spinners, Pakistan’s reliance is on its fast bowlers.
Sir Lanka’s captain Mahela Jayawardene says that no one player but the whole Pakistan cricket team is dangerous.
Muralidharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, while Pakistan’s captain says that this competition will be tough.
Shoaib Malik has said “we have played Murali Dharan before and will take care of Mendis as well. We have made a secret game plan and will reveal it on the ground”.
Will the Pakistan and Sir Lanka series live up to claims of being interesting and thrilling?
Which side will dominate in the Pakistan and Siri Lanka series?
who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Let us know of your opinion.
Gulfam, London, Publish statements that are of liking, you give preference to those too, it is our wish that even you write some truth, do not entangle the statement like Mukher Jee because it is commanded to say truth in front of tyrant and it is equal to Crusade(Jihad). What to say of Mukher Jee, change the statement between news and try to weep.

It is all these people's doing Kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years.
No, no one  asked, now they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism so they have started talking about peace and settlement.
First they generally massacred Muslims now they are perplexedly settling the matters.
In any way Pakistan has to understand their duplicitous policies.
Asad Khan London
India is making situations so that the Kashmir situation is overlooked.
But Pakistan has always shown India's true face to the world.
Even the British government is now understanding this, that is why India is now ruining Pakistan's reputation by terrorism accusations to distract from the Kashmir situation.
And hesitates to talk with Pakistan about this.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that by resolving the issue of Kashmir will bring an end to extremism, the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
it should be clear that the newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister while talking to media in Mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Does India want to avoid the comprehensive talks by on the basis of terrorism?
Enlighten us with your views
Usman Aftab,
I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
Rather it wants to keep it in check, and hence is thinking of taking certain steps. They know that Pakistan is a nuclear state.
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries are only thinking that if they corner Pakistan, they would face some political and geographic problems. They want to help Pakistan, but also want to be successful in their goal.

It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn Pakistan.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.

Raas Al Khaima, It is due to America that wrong statements are being given , America is out of its mind but now India is also doing the same, India should try attacking , then it will become crystal clear that who stands where.
Israel is attacking Hammas but nobody has that much integrity to stop them. India also want to follow Israel's foot steps
Prime Minister Syed YOusaf Raza Gillini said that the newly elected vice president Joe Biden had played an important role in steping down of previous president musharraf as army cheif and restoring crippled democracy, thats why the government of pakistan has awarded him with Sitare-e-Imtiaz (honour medal)

American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference advised newly elected President Barack Obama saying that he had made many mistakes in his presidency, and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
'I did, as a president, whatever I felt was appropriate, according to the situation, and the American law and constitution, giving preference to American interest over my own acceptance'.
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him, and considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this is my last press conference, and I thank the journalists and other friends who are present in the press conference.
Do you think Obama will not repeat the mistakes that Bush made?
Did Bush delay accepting his mistake?

This is very hurtful incident that Israel is publicly massacring the Palestinians, same situation is here in Kashmir but Security Council do not even bother by it.
As many organizations who are in Palestine and Kashmir should continue their fight till freedom and by creating unity between themselves keep fighting every kind of aggression, one of these days their Martyr will bring result. By the will of Allah
Israeli air attacks still continues in Gaza, since now several Palestinian Men, Women and children have been martyred.
Important political leader of Hamas Nazarian have been martyred with wife and kids.
There meeting of Security Council ended without any decision.
The condemning resolution presented by Libia and other Arab countries against Israel is facing American opposition in the meeting.
From the last few days there has been bombing by Israeli planes on the Palestinian civilian population.
The whole world cried out about the Mumbai issue, but the Israeli attacks do not seem a massacre to anyone including America and Britain.

I think the actual point that the majority of our nation in illetrate. They even dont   know where their money is going to. Government  is interested in applying taxes and fullfil their duties. Electricity and Gas shortage will remain same.
Because who are elected by public are very well known
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has taken a serious position.
On the other side, there was an increase of an average of 18% in gas rates, while the unavailability of petrol in some cities has become a cause of great difficulty for the public.
Among the manufacturing and business circles, there are strong protests and severe reactions going on, to the long power cut and gas crisis.
The producers have given the ultimatum to close the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is perturbed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
The production life cycle has become practically paralyzed.
The government institutions are blaming each other to express their stand.
Are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas not a joke against the nation?
Why is attention not being paid to solve the problems.
Are the wheels of national development not seeming jammed to the government?
What immediate steps can you suggest to gain control over this crisis?
Let us know of your opinions.

the Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian Cricket Team had to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20 twenty on Pakistan Tour.
The Vice-President of the Indian Cricket Board Rajeev Shukla who spoke to the news said that the board has asked the Government to allow the Pakistan Tour but because of the serious matters between the two countries this tour is not possible.
Is it right to use available political issue of the Indian government as the passport to cancel the cricket tour, the games must not be kept away from politics?
Isn't the decision of the Indian Government towards cricket a loss?
Even though the security in India was poor, the English Cricket Team tour was going on, so why don't the Indian team do the Pakistan Tour?

Salman Karachi
People who are proud to go to India
And make their films and own Videos  should now open their eyes and see that how Indians respect you
I remember an interview of adnan sami in which he said that I am not a Pakistani, my nationality is British.
Adnan Sami needs that he should come to Pakistan at first opportunity because respect did not suited him even there.
Fareed Ahmad
Karachi
Indians attitude have changed after Mumbai attack.
Jagjit showed his reaction in this form that he hates Pakistan and Pakistani.
it should be known that Adnan Sami sung seven songs of Asha Bhosla, now how can he be out of tune, Adnan Sami should stay in India, no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam
Karachi, i will only say this on the statement of Jagjit Singh that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements suitable to situation Pakistanis open your eyes that how much you are given worth in India, understand the thinking of Hindu.
After the Mumbai incident, their hateful statements have increased now they are spitting poison against popular singer Adnan Sami.
according to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said "You dog this is a farewell kiss"
after that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards Bush. president Bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself.
second shoe hit the American Flag.
Security personnels dragged the journalist away from there.
at this point, president Bush said that he didn't know why he had done so , Shoe was of number 10, I had no problem.
do you think this reaction of the journalist wasn't an expression of deprecation or President bush from the Iraqi people?
what would you say on this incident?
The tension between Pakistan and India's relations after the terrorism in Mumbai got further intense when the fighter planes from the Indian Air force violated the Pakistani airspace in Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
as a result of retaliation from Pak Air force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
sources say that both Indian planes were loaded with ammunition.
It is the first incident of its nature in the present strained situation.
Pakistan Air Force has affirmed that it is absolutely ready to defend the country .
Federal Minister of Information Sherry Rehman has stated that the Indian leaders have acknowledged the violation of Pakistani airspace, however this happened by mistake.
Pakistan's military sources have declared that this is a grave incident.
Do you think India really intends to launch an air raid on Pakistan?
Is India's claim true, about the violation of Pakistani airspace being a mistake, or is India trying to cover up an attempt made to annalyze the capability of Pakistan Air Force?
This incident will cause an increase in tension between the two countries?

Among those people and institutes being recognized with honors on the occasion, for working for human rights, apart from Benazir Bhutto, were former American Attorney General, Louis Ramsey Clark and Human Rights Watch, the organisation that works around the world for human rights.
On this occasion, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Abdullah Husain Harun and other senior embassy agents were present.
What do you say about the former martyr Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto receiving this award?
Samir

It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she changed totally.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party, and made her son the representative of Peoples Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi, This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
But until the iron ax is not fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are just like this, that they are adopting secretive ways. This is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations have included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed as well as two other Pakistani citizens and that of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organisations into the list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaidah and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, practically non-existent organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba Operation Chief, Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organisations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organisations, they will be restricted from traveling and will be under arrest.
They will have to face cases.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India accusing these organizations for being responsible for the Mumbai Attacks without any proof?
Doesn't India have any local terrorist groups ?
Aren't the world organizations aware of the persecution of minorities in India?

from Karachi, says, Our leaders should understand that the people they are targetting by their military operations, are the ones who are actually the true patriots, who are enduring all types of cruelty but continue to love Pakistan more than their own lives.
If there would be war then they will fight for Pakistan.
When their love would be felt, just condenming politics will not work. I think between both, there might be going a resulting war.
