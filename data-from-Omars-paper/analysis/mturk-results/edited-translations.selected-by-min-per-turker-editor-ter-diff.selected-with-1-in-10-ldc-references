'First nuclear experiment was done in 1990'
Thomas Reid, who has worked in the Lever National Laboratory in America as a weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the former director of technical intelligence at Los Alamos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.
This book was titled "Nuclear Express: Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation," and both writers have claimed that whichever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or had the support of another nuclear power.
In an interview with U.S. news agencies, Thomas Reid said that in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's rule, China experimented with Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Thomas Reid said that for many reasons, he believes that China had experimented with Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
The reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.
He further added that this was the reason that in 1998 in a span of only two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments in response to Indian nuclear experiments.
Thomas Reid reminds us that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiments.
He further said that atomic bomb test Pakistan conducted on May 28, 1998 was made with extreme care, and Pakistani scientists had complete confidence in it.
When Thomas Reeds was questioned about China providing nuclear technology to Pakistan he replied that India was a common enemy for Pakistan and China.
He said that there is a proof that Doctor Abdul Qadeer Khan used Chinese designs, and the documents which were acquired from Libya confirm this statement.
He further stated that doing combined nuclear tests is common, and that in 1990 the United States conducted a nuclear test for Britain on an open belt in the Nevada desert.
He said that he also assumed that Israel was given access to the results of this test.
Thomas Reed was also questioned whether the Chinese nuclear spread program is continuing?
On this, Thomas Reed said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and design to a nuclear facility in Iran's city Isfahan since 1990.
Additionally, China provided Iran a nuclear enrichment plant.
He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen thorough North Korea.

Speaking to the protesters, senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, Federal Union of Journalists, C.R.

Fearing a certain lobby of the media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of the journalists.
He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.
An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.

Speaking to the protestors, the General Secretary of PUFJ said that today, throughout the country, journalist organizations are observing a black day against the removal of journalists and newspaper workers, whereas journalists will go to the parliamentary session wearing black bands on their arms to get back their rights.
According to Mazhar Abbas, in 50% of the Pakistani newspapers and TV channels the workers and journalists were being exploited, where they work without any agreement.
He said that until now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been removed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is being feared that the owners will remove hundreds more in the present year, making an excuse of the present financial crisis.
Mazhar Abbas said that the journalist movement will continue until removed employees are reinstated, newspaper wages fixed by the Seventh Wage board award are enforced, and the salaries owed by TV channels and newspaper workers is paid.

819 billion dollars package for economic revival approved.
All members of the Republican party voted against President Obama's plan.
Members of the Republican party said that the economic plan is very expensive and will not prove effective.
In the members assembly, 240 votes were drawn in favor of this package, while 160 were drawn against it.
This economic revival plan will be presented next week in the Senate, where the ruling Democratic party has very little majority.
Concern is being expressed that great opposition from the Republican party may not make it easy for Senate approval.
After the economic revival plan was approved by the members assembly, Barrack Obama urged members to look past political differences, and work together on this plan.
President Obama said that this plan, which he was hopeful would become law by next month, will prove to create a peaceful atmosphere in the country, which will stimulate the American economy.
According to this plan, working-class people will be relieved of 275 billion dollars worth of debt, and 540 billion dollars will be paid for roads, bridges, schools, unemployment allowance and research for new technology.
BBC writer Richard Luster in Washington has stated that Barrack Obama intended to introduce a new political culture by putting back the political disagreements but discussion this Economic Package has once again made political pillars sore.
Republican members of the senate called the proposed bill a waste of government money, and said that it will not help in creating new employment opportunities.
They instead stressed the bill passed by their own party, in which more importance was given to tax cuts.
They said that more employment opportunities could be formed with less capital through their bill.
They said that compared to constructive plans, more employment opportunities could be formed through tax cuts.
Bitterness between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Nearly screaming, Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Israeli president that the blood of many humans were spilled in Gaza, and it saddened him to see that people could watch this armed killing from Israel and clap in agreement.
Mr. Erdogan said that ""I believe that you are using such words to publicly ease your guilty conscience.  But you killed those people, and I will not forget those children who were killed near the shore.""
Simon said that Gaza's calamity is not due to Israel, but rather Hamas, who have established a dangerous dictatorship over there.
A BBC journalist from Davos said that he had never seen such a scene in an global economic forum before.
However, Erdogan later stated that he respected the aged Israeli president, falsely claiming that he was not yelling at him.
Turkey is one of the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, but for the last few years there has been tension between them.
The Attacks Were Not Planned In Pakistan.
Speaking to an Indian news channel, NDTV, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said that the report of the Pakistani investigations into the Mumbai blast will be prepared soon.
In the attacks that took place in Mumbai, last November, more than 170 persons were killed.
India claims that the responsibility for the attacks belongs to the extremist group, Lashkar-e-Taiba.
India also said that Pakistani 'state factors' were guilty in the Mumbai attacks.
After the Mumbai attacks, the relations between the two countries were affected.
The high commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan gave his first statement about the report of the Pakistani investigations, from which it becomes evident as to what is within the report.
Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that as far as the investigation has gone, Pakistani land has not been used.
It must be some other place not including England.
These are the two places (Pakistan and Britain) about which I was worried.
India and the international community have created a lot of pressure on Pakistan to take action against the culprits of the Mumbai attacks.
Wajid Shamsul Haq said: We are not trying to cover it up.
We believe in taking action based on facts.
The world will accept our investigations.
We will try to satisfy India over the results of the investigation.
While defending the delay in the investigation in Pakistan, he said that it takes time to collect, understand and check these kind of things.
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Haq said that it took 45 days for India to present its dossier.
A black man elected as the republican leader too.
In the sixth round of elections in the Republican party, Michael Steel has won, receiving 91 votes out of 168.
In the selection for the post of Chairman, the candidate opposing Steele, Katon Dawson, got 77 votes, whereas the ex-Chairman Duncan withdrew from the competition in the second stage.
Newspaper writers say that among the five candidates who stood for the chairmanship of the Republican Party, Michael Steele was considered the most moderate leader.
After winning, Michael Steele said in his speech, "We are going to tell our friends and foes together that they can join with us, but whoever wants to spoil this, they should be ready to be separated from us." Michael Steele is from Maryland, where he was Deputy Governor.
He rose to fame in 2006, when he ran for a Senate seat.
After losing the Senatorial election, he became the chairman of the Political Conservative Committee of the party.
Now, after being selected the chairman of the party, the country-wide projects of the party will be under his supervision.
He fought in the election, promising that he would take the party in a new direction, and that he would use new techniques to join old-fashioned supporters with the party.
The Indian claim of the presence of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaysh-e-Mohammad in Jammu.
There are reports of the presence of militants in the Ponch province of Jammu.
According to government sources, upon receiving secret reports, the police and the army have surrounded the region and have begun searching.
During this, a fight started in which four militants, two soldiers and one policeman were killed.
According to the sources, fights were going on until the last news broke.  In this area, where militants associated with Lashker-e-Tayyaba and Josh-e-Muhammad are present, more soldiers have been sent to fight them.
During this, chief minister Omer Abdullah, nominated by the involved officials, met with the governor.  He directly gave the news of the Assembly leader's election from his party national conference.
Congress, the ally of the National Conference, also informed the governor of their advocacy of Omar Abdullah.
Omar Abdullah will take oath as the chief minister of the state.
Remember, the National Conference became the biggest party by gaining 28 seats in the 87 member assembly in the current state elections. Keep in mind that separatist parties boycotted the elections.
Congress, which secured 17 seats, accepted to form a coalition government with the National Conference.
Today, party workers welcomed Omar Abdullah with great fanfare on his arrival in Srinagar.
On this occasion, Omar Abdullah says that he will play his role in making the talks possible between the Indian government and separatists. However, this will not be possible until the elections in India and formation of the new government.
Role of EU for Peace in the Middle East.
From the official point of view, the role of the European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
According to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
The European Union's spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, has said that every such effort is appreciated which is helpful in sending the European Union's message to the opponents of the war.
It seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned.
In reality, the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
As the head of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is even weaker than before.
Also, the internal issues have made it helpless.
On the other hand, the French President, Sarkozy, is behaving as if he is still the President of the European Union.
France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role, and he is capable of it, but he does not have the permission to do so.
The most funny situation is faced by the French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner.
He is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of Czech republic Schwarzenberg.
The problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the Middle East war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right of self defense whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. moreover Germany has sent its special ambassador to Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance, it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.
The proof for this is,  Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.
this is a golden chance for the European Union to do something, since America; due to the policies of George W. Bush has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial Crisis: German industrialist billionaire commites Suicide
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany left a huge business group behind him.
but a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 and  one billion euro loan it needed immediately , so Merkle went into deep pressure.
Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had gone from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic power.
After the death of his father, Adolf Merkel took over his family business. He developed it quick, putting it on new lines.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm,the  Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm, always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine."
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the management of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have sanctioned 400 million Euros in floating loans for his group. But under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.
After the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain the same.
Crime rate among the immigrants in Germany.
According to the fresh statistics, crime rate among the immigrants from 2004 to 2007 is
Reduced from 9.22%
to 4.21%
According to Joachim Herrmann, the interior minister of Baweria province, this is a positive change.
He said: "It is important to note that the number of foreigners getting German citizenship is increasing."
Therefore it should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German, his background is foreign.
Herrmann said that his province will take this in to account when gathering statistics in 2010.
Besides Baweria, Hamburg is also thinking in the same lines.
A senator for foreign affairs from CDU, Christoph Ahlhaus, has said: "When research is done in a scientific manner, man can not pre-decide its results but it is based on the facts and figures that come out as a result of the research."
Ahlhaus diverted attention to a research report from the anti-crime provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamburg, it was discovered that out of all crimes happening there is a percentage that have the involvement of foreigners.
results showed that the foreigners here have
Tthe crime rate was less as compared to crime all over the province.
By contrast, when a survey was done in 2006 on crimes in youth in Berlin, it was determined that young people having foreign background had a percentage of 44%.
was 7 percent
However, other political parties of Germany for example, SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei,were against this proposal that while collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired which German citizens have foreign backgrounds.

The German Chancellor, Angela Merchel, also expressed hopes for the new American president.

Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that Obama seems like a serious and open-hearted person, qualities he felt were positive.
As such, the previous American president's policies were subject to criticism.
However, the previous administration is definitely credited with persuading China to play a more constructive role on the international level. With regards to the new president, China's leader has said that he will have to work for strong military ties between the countries.
Gosuwe Hu, an expert on Chinese politics active in Bokhum, Germany, says:
From this viewpoint, I am certain that Obama and his economic team will, within the coming weeks and months, pressure the Beijing government into pegging the Chinese currency at a stable and market-representing exchange rate.
The previous American administration also increased ties with India.
About where Obama might take those ties, Professor Christopher Raj, expert on American sciences in New Delhi, says that we are now closer to a strategic partnership, but Obama cannot make any changes overnight.
In his message to Obama, Pope Benedict has stressed peace and co-operation in the world.

President Ahmede Nejad has said in his message: "You know that for the last 19 days Israel has been bent upon human genocide, murdering innocent children, and subjecting homes, mosques, schools and hospitals to barbaric bombing.

President George Bush: Terrorism is Still a Threat to USA
MEHER/MAHAR news agency has copied from the German news agency that the US President, while addressing his successor Barak Obama and the nation in his farewell speech, said that though the US is safer than it was seven years ago, the threat of terrorism still looms over USA.
Bush said that because enemy terrorists are waiting patiently to attack America and have a strong determination to do so, America should never be unaware about its security.
The American president ignored the pain and suffering of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza and defended his policies, saying that America is still the biggest supporter of Gaza's independence. However, commentators do not accept the reality of the unpopular president's remarks, as America is neither a supporter of freedom, nor a supporter of human rights, but rather is the most mischievous country in the world. Not only does it support a blood thirsty country like Israel, but it is also directly involved in its crimes.
The Israelis openly kill woman, children and other civilians. Despite this, the American president is congratulating them. This is the American humanity and freedom which the world is seeing in Gaza and other places.
Usama Hamdan: Presence of army in Palestine continues

Hamadan said that the one sided ceasefire was an unsuccessful effort of Israel to escape defeat. He said that if Israel wants long term peace, it will have to accept Hamas's conditions as well as end this siege.
He made it clear that if Israel tries a one-sided ceasefire with its army remaining in the Gaza belt, there will be resistance.
Addressing a one-way conference from Beirut, Usamah Hamdan called for European nations to break ties with Israel.
The Hamas leader said that the increasing numbers of the martyred and injured will only increase our determination.
He also told the Palestinian public to stay firmly rooted and resist the enemy like a boulder.

Research Shows Tea May Be An Effective Cure Of Chest Cancer
New Research Indicates Drinking 3 Cups Of Tea Daily May Be An Effective Deterrent Of Chest Cancer
Tea Drinking Reduces The Risk Of Chest Cancer In Women Over 50 By 33%
Research At The Moffitt Cancer Center In Florida, U.S.A. Shows Tea Deters Chest Cancer In Women Over 50
Chest Cancer Is Reduced by 33% In Those Who Drink At Least Three Cups Of Tea Everyday
It is also told in the research that it does not help older women even if they drink three or more cups of tea daily.
Specialists think that this is because of the presence of such components in tea that are more effective against such types of cancer tumors, which usually targets women under 50 years of age.
In Moffitt Cancer Center, in the city of Tampa, Florida state, a research was conducted on over 5000 women, who had undergone treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles with women who were safe from breast cancer.
The experts also found out that on a specific type of cancer called lobular cancer, the drinking of tea has shown clear effects, and has decreased its occurrence by 66 percent.
A tenth of every breast cancer patient suffers this type of cancer.
This type of cancer is more dangerous because it is deeper and is usually only known after it spreads quite a bit.
Experts say that regular tea consumption, at least three cups a day, can drastically reduce the occurrence of breast cancer in young women.
They say that making tea a regular beverage taken on a daily basis and included in ones daily activities causes the suitable defense required against cancer in the body.
In Britain, every year, approximately 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer.
The biggest military challenge facing the American war in Afghanistan is gas.
American Defense Minister Robert Gates has said that the war in Afghanistan is the biggest military challenge faced by America.

Gates told the Senate Armed Services committee that fighting is not the only solution to the Afghanistan issue. But he added that in order to secure several areas, sufficient numbers of troops are not deployed, and the Taliban take advantage of that to continue their operations.
Why Reduce Exercise With Age?
New Research
Exercise at any age is good for your health.
It energizes your heart, reduces cholesterol levels, helps in keeping weight low, helps to prevent diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer's or dementia.
Unfortunately the ability to exercise decreases for many people as they age.
Experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active however age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise from not doing exercise.
Dr. Patricia Palecca, of Mayo Clinic Minnesota, says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to exercise and lack of bodily activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.
She lead a study of how heart related diseases and the ability to exercise is related to old age.
The team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to measure the working of the heart.
The pumping of the blood by the heart - its contraction and relaxation - was studied.
The experts focused on the left part of the heart which is the main part for pumping blood.
They learned that as people grew older there was an increase in faults in the relaxation of the heart.
Dr. Patricia says that as age increases the faults in the relaxation of the heart begin to appear and this affects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garwin Cain was also a part of this study.
He says that they were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this and that this clearly proves how deep of a relationship there is between the decrease of exercise and the relaxation of the heart.
Some times blood pressure can cause disorders in the heart such as its functions and heart diseases.
If the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard, then they can take advantage of the benefits of exercise even with age.
A detailed report in this matter is published in a magazine of the American Medical Association.
No Chances of War with Pakistan: Indian Army chief
Indian Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor - No War with Pakistan
He has accused that despite the commitments and international pressure on Pakistan as a result of Mumbai attacks, the infrastructure of terrorism is not only existent but also proactive in Pakistan.
He said this while talking to the correspondents in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day tour to the valley of Kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in New Delhi, administered by Kashmir and in preparation of armed forces on the borders.
He was asked a question about his thoughts on the media reports that Pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from India regarding the Mumbai attacks.
General Kapoor said that the decisions of peace or war matters are decided by the political leadership.
Talking about the presence of the skeleton of terrorism on the land of Pakistan, he said allegedly, that India will fight against such circumstances and those who are ready to destroy peace and weaken India.
He said that there are around 7 to 800 fighters present on the land of Indian Kashmir from which almost 50% are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that only with the betterment in the weather, the efforts of encroachment between Pakistan and Kashmir under its government can be increased.  Although India has increased security on the borders.
They have refused the possibility of reduction in the number of army soldiers in Indian Kashmir by stating that one can't compromise over the country's security.
May God answer the world's prayers and may Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan are effected by this change.
That what will be what Mr. Barrack Obama gives to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams.
The oath taking of Obama as the President of America, whose part of the name is also Hussain, is where historically important in all the ways, is also a great challenge for the history.
Not only for his own self but also for those who supported him with all their hearts.
This challenge will also be for the white majority as it's not easy for them to accept that a colored man is ruling over them.
Here in South Asia, Muslims who have expectations from him, should remember that he has been elected as the President of the United States. And Obama should remember that being President of the United States actually means being the President of the entire world.
A man whose brothers and sisters were brought to America as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, this will be a win for the people who love him.
What will be its effect on South Asia, and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan?
?
Whether it is by Obama or some one else, the policy of the entire world is done by Jews who lobby billionaires and influence powerful and effective people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts, the offensive reactions of India, America and Israel are in front of everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat that had a regular Army and Law.
He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a  pact.
It is a matter of sorrow that our government treated Swat like a step-mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government by the ruler of Swat.
No interest was taken in the building and development works.
The girls who are getting educations today are much fewer than those who used to get educated in the previous era.
In the Frontier Province there is a continuous targeting of educational institutions by the Taliban.
Most of the schools that have been destroyed in district Swat are the girl's schools.
It is not just that, but the Taliban has imposed a ban on girl's education.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.
what do you think, by stopping girls' education, thatthe Taliban want to achieve?
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities so far?
what do you think the government should do?
The question should be that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get as a result?
because the people of Swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them, otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that even during the Curfew. How can people be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing?
When the writ of the government is not being let implemented, how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities?
Now the question arises that having an armed force, armed with modern weapons, modern technologies and intelligence systems, why the government can not control these few Taliban.
The only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head, that neither their arms can reach nor they are apprehended.
The result of the discussion is that the Taliban with their wrong steps are making it easier for the imperialists.
Fifteen years before the war was being continued in Afghanistan.
ISI is controlling the Taliban when at that time their opponent was the North Coalition who was supported by Russia, India, and Iran.
Then suddenly the situation changed, and actions of the Taliban began to appear.
ISI was also offered dollars from America, causing past friends to become enemies.
Now the situation is that this war continues, but still helping Pakistan are Iran, India, and Russia.
Unless humans discover right and wrong then they will keep making mistakes.
For example, if a thief who goes to steal gets the thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse with punishment, then he fears from God and will not steal.
Unless Israel understands that they are doing wrong and spilling the blood of innocents, then they will get punishment for it. They will keep playing with the blood of innocents of Gaza till then.
Respects!
Is war, armed movement, and terrorism a solution to problems?
If not, then what is the solution of the problems?
It is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but adds 'blessings' to them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development that Nelson Mandela used in South Africa.
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
After the Kashmiris took part in the elections, it appears that they have accepted this point of view.
We are in  the third week of Israeli attacks on Gaza and the number of deaths have risen to close to a thousand.
To date, a ceasefire was not possible despite worldwide diplomatic efforts.
According to another report, since the attacks began on December 27, 90,000 Palestinians have left their homes and moved to a safer location.
Aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, saying that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victims of severe psychological and emotional problems.
What are you saying?
What should happen next?
How is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

The Taliban should be given a chance.
basit, Peshawar
Please wake up! If the Taliban started doing the real Jihad, then who will kill the innocent people?
Who will burn down the girls' schools?
Who will do kidnapping for ransom, or if the ransom is not paid, then blame people of being American agents and hang them on the towers?
These Taliban members have brought more damage to Islam than any nation or religion has ever brought.
Pashtoon Rore
Kohat, Pakistan
If the whole Muslim world gives a joint threat to attack Israel, then you will see how upset America, its father, will be.
Immediately, not only talks on ceasefire, but ceasefire itself, will really happen as well.
What can be done? Where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from?
Someone should tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step since he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
The responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies with Arabs and the Muslim world, but its on the whole world to raise their voices against tyranny.
This unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
Just like in Pakistan and India, before the 30th of June or the end of the fiscal year the government institutions are looted. The American regime, just before its end, had given a green light to Israel to do whatever it wants.
On one hand, America says that efforts will be made for a ceasefire.
On the other hand, the United Nation is passing one resolution over another but both have done practically nothing. This means that the United Nations is also working  to crush the Muslims.
All the Islamic Countries should cancel their membership in United Nations and they should lay the foundation of their own international organization.
Many examples are in front of us where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations came forward and only the Muslims suffered.
What is the advantage of these actions when BBC does not have to print anything?
Now where have the principles of journalism been buried when the unrequired blood, especially of the Muslims, starts flowing and the ghost of unbiased reporting starts riding over the BBC?
It otherwise portrays itself as a flag bearer of righteousness.
Saying something from their side is a far away thing when they do not even want comments.
It is from the Muslims.
The difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims and people like you live among Muslims.
[syja786]
A recent trend in BBC forums has been the subject of terrorism of India, and the subject sometimes arises while discussing suicide attacks.
These anti-Islamic comments often use the term extremism.
But the real extremist is the person who made the above comment.
When will Muslims understand that Dajjal can not be fought with the sword?
Looking at the helpless people facing the Israel bombings, if the heart does not cry, what does it do?
The most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that using the name of Jihad disfigures the beautiful face of Islam.
When a majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existence of Israel, what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks?
The conduct of both sides is misanthropic.
The action of the United Nations and the United States seem to support the wrongdoings of Israel.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
The real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism. After all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are.
So this situation, in common terms, is called DADAGEERI, which means do what ever you can.
It hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry.
Medicine for the injured and coffins for the dead are being supplied by the Arab leaders and in case
the Israeli attacks should take place.
This is the actual problem. The leaders of Muslim countries, including the Saudi crown prince are in a false sleep. They have an neither an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
They should take immediate measures against Israel.
For example, stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Salam to All brothers and sisters!
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is the same as them declaring defeat.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature.  The steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer, growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants don't realize.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Israel and Hamas should enter a truce so that the death and destruction can come to an end.
Mohammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France
Absolutely correctly stated.
Suppose that Hamas is 100% truthful, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah.  Even then, they should know that if a good deed results in the destruction of an established house, it is no longer a good deed.
For those who claim to love God, love the messenger, and love their religion, loving mankind is a part of their faith.
As if it is the order of Allah to wipe all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than Muslims.
Najibur Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
Rather than facing destruction, they are instead invited to come to Islam.
Yet, Jihad is ordered against those who conspire against the religion.
Though these people should face opposition as long as they conspire against Islam, it by no means suggests that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering.
Brothers, the killer of innocent children only faces destruction.
I ask my friends to reflect how despite the lack of acceptance anywhere for Israelis in the past, they have grown strong and autonomous today because of their unity.
There's no division of Shea's and Sunnis within the Jews, rather as one people they have been able to develop and grow strong in every aspect.
In contrast, what kind of condition are the 55 Islamic countries in?
Not only are these countries behind in every respect, but they remain helpless as their enemies kill them, so that all they can do is wait for death.
It is essential that all Muslim countries unite to strategically prepare against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
There is no better strategy than to recognize Israel, learn modern education and means of progress, and let the world live in peace and harmony.
The Muslims have plenty of land and means as well.
The need is for proper use.
The first and most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque and this was impossible without removing Yasin and Arafat from the way.
The world is witnessing how Palestinians have been scattering after the death of these two leaders.
The Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
In 1974, a Pakistani Prime Minister was so worldly trusted that for the first time in history he manged to gather all the Muslim leaders under one roof with one hundred percent attendance.
Today, on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task to get the whole nation to promise to keep unity.
Also, while eradicating the differences between other Muslims,  its (The formation of Islamic common wealth) mission will be carried forward
Its a monster that has gripped Palestine for half a century.
This monster has many faces.
Many times this monster criticizes itself from its own but different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
And its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This monster is most unhappy with Islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through Islam, Muslims, the perfect religion of Muslim and Practical Islam as the history tells that Islam has put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
Bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since 27th of December.
More than 300 Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
After the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
Through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has ordered Israel and the Palestinian authorities to cease fire.
However, the Israeli authorities say they will continue operation in Gaza until they make sure the rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
In your opinion, is this claim by Israel true?  Is Israel  doing all this to defend its own sovereignty?
Is the world community doing enough in this situation?
Does this aggression have any relation to the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can any improvement be expected in the situation in the middle east after the newly elected American president Barak Obama takes office?

After all; a neutral impression is to be maintained.
Although the news from BBC is usually correct; the real thing is the style of the news.
What should be pointed out and what news should be given less importance.

Zaheer Chughtai
In this art now a days; the Pakistani electronic and print media, especially some Urdu newspapers and columnists, are no more behind anyone who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism, or in the ""grudge of Muavia"" written on them.
Has said that the United Nations, which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of it's mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. How long will this hypocrisy continue?
Why is so much oppression being done on the Muslims? If country like America stop supporting these Jews, then Allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support, and then see what kind of life they get.
The famous unjust people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.
In the words of a poet
Oppression is oppression, that the more it's done the more it is erased.
Blood is blood, that the more it falls, the more it gathers.
Now who can tell that who did terrorism?
Is all this not included in terrorism? Why does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocent not red?
And why is there no one to send a mourning message from anywhere?
I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.
I can not find the words that are strong enough to condemn the actions that resulted in the dead bodies on the road, and the helpless, injured, and innocent faces soaked in blood.
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims in this situation.  On the one hand, because of the killing in India the rest of the world comes over to Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations that we would normally do on our own.
On the other hand, Israel is killing generations of muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent.  This is unbearable!
There is delay but NEVER in the house of God and only then will this darkness be shed. Then
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Elections are important for securing the people's support, especially in countries like Israel, and rulers should continue to hold them.  However, history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy so Barrack Obama likely won't either.  Regime, whether black or white, is still a regime.
From the debates in the forum it is evident that everyone is sad about Benazir's death, however we can not ignore her political mistakes.
There's room for debate about whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was so dear then why did it take American involvement to end Musharaf's ten year dictatorship?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the public needed her. Unfortunately, she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised.
When each and every historic personality is being accused, there is no one to say anything about this.

Few things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done about them.

Sir, probably you should not only study Pakistan's history but that of 4 friends and 7 other countries. Maybe you would agree with Psycho's point of view.

How merciless is our nation. We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.

Some things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar if you en wreathe him with books.    When we think nothing can be done to change things, we ignore the issues.   You can't make an ass any smarter by surrounding him with books.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks but Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.    After the Bombay attacks, talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted.  It is in the best interest of both countries for these talks to resume.
If they talk about war then both the sides will suffer human loss.    If they go to war, both countries will suffer the loss of human life.
India says that Pakistani citizen is caught in Bombay attacks. And he has written and sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. But earlier, when India caught this extremist, said that he is a smart engineer but later they declared him to have studied only four grades. This is what has to be considered.    The extremist arrested by India in the Bombay attacks is said to be a Pakistani citizen.   The extremist was reported to be an engineer, but was later found to have only completed four years of schooling.
Merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and all Christian members of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.    Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all members of the forum.
We want flowers of peace rather in the flame of war.
War is, itself, a problem.
What solution will the war give?
Today, will give Fire and blood.
Tomorrow, will give hunger and necessity.
For this wise people,
it is better that war keeps postponing.
In your and our garden.
It is better that candle keeps lit.
The relationship of India and America have become deep and India knows that when the time comes America will openly deceive Pakistan.
This is also the old history of America.
If an Indian attack occurs, America would achieve its goals at the expense of India.
Pakistan should make it known very clearly that we shall never attack India first, but if we are invaded there will never again be any peace, reconciliation or ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied. Even if it means we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
This is the Islamic history.
Even before this resolution the Pakistani public and army had already given the message that they wanted to establish.
Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it more easier for them than expected. The world community has relaxed its pressure now in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has shown.
While ignoring India's unnecessary bribery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a ""Side Effect"" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
There are not even two people that will say that this is not a heinous act.
The real question is, when thousands of the Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at the time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they've done over the past year?
How many Taliban die each day due to their firing of thousands of mortar and canon shells?
I appeal to the ICI that they stop their guardianship of the Taliban, for God's sake, and let us live peacefully in paradise like Swat,
and that they stop this fixed operation.
The day is not far when a resolution will be passed in the United Nations against army intervention in Pakistan, the same way as it was passed against Jama'athud-Da'wah.
Riyaz Ahmad Farooqi
First of all, our radicalism and our protecting them, is alone, sufficient to provide complete proof and permissibility for action against us. And the very day such a resolution is passed, there is all probability that no voice will be raised in our support, in the United Nations.
And supposing the passing of such a resolution is delayed, some other strength will definitely leave our aid to ourself,, keeping the example of America in front of them.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
The bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah, and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are immortal even after they die.
There is an international game being played here, in which the public is ruled by fear through barbarism and ferociousness.
The license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will seize the government.
These acts of so-called Islamic "activists" in the name of religion is without doubt worthy of condemnation.
These supporters of extremists can see the injustice of America, but instead of expressing grievance about those dishonest acts they clearly shun them by giving them the name of tribal traditions.
Even by calling it "tribal traditions", and sometimes in the name of Islam, any pious man will still fail to give reason for such dishonest acts.
In my view, our Army people are associated with these people.
When these people move from a place then it takes time before they can be caught. There should be time for that, but it's a stretch that they will get there on time before they are long gone.
Are they so merciless that they kidnap fifty or seventy men and our Army applauds at them like a spectator?
They are servants of Allah and so is the Army.
It is very clear that there is something fishy.
Instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and punitive occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion, was seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell!
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said, that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose not to know about it.
Who burnt the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on her refusal of oath after the Prophet (PB-UH) passed away and who took her husband's life with the rope in his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
Was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina the act of Christians and not the Jews?
Without accepting reality, the motives can not be diminished nor correction can be made.
BBC, please stop this dual-headed policy.
Better than this topic is the super hit title "Shoeing of Bush - Fair or Unfair"?
It should have been.
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
Please show some modesty. A human was pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office?
The success of Operation Sherdil, and across the border, Operation Lion Heart, depends on whose favor the opinion of general public is in.
This act is of American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahab is a victim of this conspiracy.
All discussions on this forum will now be anti-Taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined Taliban and they are doing what they can to change the public opinion.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public? They even report things like this "Bombing on Taliban Residences", and "A Shell Falling on a House Kills Two Children and Their Mother".
Did they not know about this mistake?
Were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000, in Swat went there to do.
The bodies of the Taliban members who help the army are left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC, did not do any good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake, stop this drama.
These Taliban members have tarnished the Muslim image.
If, around the world, true Muslims don't call these terrorists Muslims, then why are these elements able to live in the lands of true Muslims?
Those who become shameless can't do hard labor, and they pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
No religion or family tradition allows this.
All the media, incl present their views on the Taliban or the tribal people in different styles.
No one, other than us tribal people, are aware of the ground realities, what the truth is, and what really is the matter.
In short, it's a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a Talib or a tribal. Warmongers, who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions, made these institutions.
This move has ashamed all Muslims.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is the Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq, a man who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that the current leadership will end this  cancer.
After the Mumbai attacks, India said that extremists are behind the attacks.
Pakistan rejected the accusations and said that it will help India in investigating the attacks in every possible way.
India said that it has given a list to Pakistan that has 20 suspected extremists being sought by India.
Now Pakistan has said that included in the list is Jaish-e-Muhammad's Molana Azhar Masood, who is not in custody and the government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before that, Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari refuted the view that the West's secret agencies and the Indian government had given evidence related to the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari has said that it has not been proven that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that its relations with India are not going to improve until its land is ceased to be used for terrorism.
In latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should sports be effected due to recent political events?
What future to you see for India-Pakistan relations?
Neither America nor India broke Pakistan.
Pakistan was broken by the Pakistanis themselves.
What else could be expected after such regionalism, communalism and vandalism.
Even Jinnah did not do good for the Muslims of India. Time has proved this.
Yasmin, Chicago
If we had kept working on the vision of Jinnah, destroying the cancer of communalism, then regionalism and vandalism would not have spread in Pakistan, and the Muslims of India would not have been treated poorly.
It's our fault that we could not bring up a leader of his stature.
if we can not care for our heroes, then
This region has great capabilities.
God knows when we'll understand and the region can progress with the blessing of unity.
In both countries the enemies to peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv sena, and RSS have been raised.
The evil powers don't want this region to progress. Therefore, these countries are controlled like puppets.
Can you imagine what status these regions of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world?
Pakistan is under persecution from God because these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
May Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
Sir, if you open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
Other than that National matter are not looking good as well, circumstances in Sarhad, Balochistan, Karachi in Sindh are in front of you.
In a situation like this, a country needs a leader who can unite all of us into a single nation.
O, Allah, have mercy on us.
In my opinion, there is no other way than a last war.
Too much has happened.
Now, this affair is win or lose.
This problem will not be solved with hypocrisy or deceit.
And neither with small big terrorism in each other countries.
Even Europe came to rest, after fighting the last great war.
If this war had not happened, then they would all be talking like Pakistan and India.
Almost all of our political parties are unified in the idea that terrorism and sectarian violence shall be eradicated from the country.
However, our own military leadership does not seem to be sincere in this assertion. On one side, Europe and America are assured that the military is sincere in achieving a terror-free state, but on the other hand, the military aids the Taliban covertly.
Now we have to think, define our path, and select one path to focus on. Thank you.
There is no doubt that the elements of Jamat-ud-dawa include a majority which belongs to Lashkar-e-Taiba, a banned organization which is now established and operating with a new name: Jamat-ud-dawa Pakistan.
However, after more focus was diverted towards humanitarian activities on India's strong request, the United Nations has also banned it. The government of Pakistan has also implemented a crackdown on this organization.
In my opinion, if these Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and focus on religion and humanitarian assistance, then it is much better.
The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan which have used the name of Jihad to recruit and nurture professional killers and criminals and their molana's are the same people who called Pakistan "Plaeedistan", meaning unclean land. These are the people who use bad names for Pakistan.
Now they are trying their best to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they don't even get close deserving the term Muslim. In fact, they deserve to be called animals or barbarians.
Pakistan's security will be at risk until these extremists are eradicated from Pakistan.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous persons or not?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose only work is to kill.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What kind of world is this where it is hard to live for one who takes the name of one major pillar of Islam, the religion of Allah?
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims but when Muslims even try to take revenge, all our hypocrite leaders together with all the non-Muslim world treat people with the true and right pain of religion just like our great leader Hafiz Saeed is being treated today.
India is in impunity of the Bombay attacks.
Pakistan relations are bitter. A better relationship could be had as a result of the last few years between the two countries having been jolted greatly.
India has always held the military and non-military groups in Pakistan responsible.
Bringing relationships back on track is being conducted by operations against these groups.
Indian security departments have held Lashkher-e-Tayyaba responsible for the Bombay attacks.
The name  Jama'athud Da'wah also comes up many times in this regards.
This is not the first time that relationships between the two countries have become serious due to some terrorist activity that took place in India.
In December 2001, after the attack on the parliament, the two neighbors were prepared to go to war.
After that, Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned and it was included in the list of terrorist groups.
Now, it is being demanded that Jama'athud Da'wah, which according to security reports is just a new form of Lashkar-e-Taiba, also be banned.
In your opinion, should this group be banned?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against the active fundamentalist groups within its boundaries?
Can putting a ban on Jama'athud Da'wah help the present Indo-
Pak crisis to subside, and how important is it for permanent peace between the two countries that armed groups be dismantled?
The Security Council of the United Nations has passed the ban on Jama'athud Da'wah. However, what proof did the Security Council have based on which it showed such urgency?
Does the Security Council always show urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful country.
Whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours? India. And they want to put the blame for it's inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis, continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salam, please do it with pleasure, but act at your own discretion.
Do not do it under American pressure.
If India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
Why does it accuse us of every thing?
As there are extremist groups and organizations in India, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the world?
What is India doing in Kashmir?
What is Israel doing?
The truth is that we are the first nuclear Muslim state, and this is the main issue.
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart.
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be part of this conspiracy.
American are not slowly but now very swiftly tightening their grip on Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances, if we as a nation dos not display unity and solidarity, then if Bangladesh can be created, anything can happen.
Terrorism is condemned, whether it is in a hotel in Mumbai or in a Marriott Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine.
Likewise, regardless of the origin of the terrorists, they should be eliminated, whether they are Pakistani or Indian or American or Israeli.
Now the question is that why the whole world, including Pakistani officials, are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack carried out on the Marriott Hotel not a terrorist attack?
Then why?
Praise the worthy Advisor interior,Mister Rehman Malik,by the grace of God, how brave he has become!

Not only this , according to the BBC Mister Malik has also tried to negate this impression with full strength that all these imprisonments are being carried out on whose orders.
Praise the lord!
Having this capability or not, this I don't want to say.
Whose war we Pakistanis are fighting
and why. We have our own priorities which we shall protect with our full strength.
Nobody has an authority to interfere in any other country.
Apparently colonial period does not seem to exist.
If people expect justice, demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan. I do not believe this is acceptable by those calling for unity.
As such, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
And this causes more feelings of opposition.
If they trust America and the United republics, then let them leave the style of new populations, and let them work on those lines, upholding the sovereignty of the state.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
In Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, security forces captured a proved camp of practically non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India's accusation is that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice told the Pakistani leadership that there should be immediate action taken against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack.
It is their claim that without a doubt, the extremists who carried out the Mumbai attacks used Pakistani land.
Meanwhile, officials in Peshawar claim that the lot of trucks which carry supplies to the united forces in Afghanistan was burned by unidentified armed people, because of which more than 50 trucks were destroyed.
This is the second attack in Peshawar on NATO and American supplies in the last 48 hours.
Meanwhile, Pakistan captured an established camp of the almost non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba. Previously, lots of efforts were carried out to try to disarm groups all the way from Karachi to the tribal regions, which included giving compensation to those who returned their weapons and even assuring them that no action would be taken against them.
The situation is telling us that the efforts undertaken in the regime of General Ziyaul Haqq, after the previous Soviet Union's interference in Afghanistan to get rid of the armed groups that formed as a result of the resistance that started through American and Saudi funding, and to bring an environment similar to that before 1980 were not successful.
The question is what does Pakistan want to do?
Does Pakistan have the ability to do so?
What do you say?

I have only one question for the standard bearers of the world.
If you kill their children, will they come to give you garlands? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill innocent people, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in negative, then you really need to fix your viewpoint.
The people were armed when there was the fear that Russia would head towards Pakistan after finishing Afghanistan, and that is why they were supplied with arms.
Now, when there is the fear that America will capture Pakistan, via Afghanistan, as the present American president has clearly mentioned in his presidential mission, why should we disarm them now?
Only such that after defeating the American or Indian army it does not have to face any resistance from the public?
Yes, if any of them are guilty of being involved in any destructive work, Pakistan can take action against them alone.
It is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved, proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it's still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
Another question is that were these terrorists supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or trained in Pakistan, and not any other country in the world?
As for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the present terrorism is in no way connected to it.
It must be remembered that Hafiz Saeed is the first 'Jehadi leader' who called the Taliban actions 'mischief'.
I'm sure that the Taliban effect is a inseparable result of American plans, and hence every person who can stand in the way of the Taliban must be removed.
Despite the support of the whole nation, the fact that Zardari and co. took action against the Lashkar is a clear sign of their frigid and kiss-up nature.
To stop the project that is running on Saudi-American funding, they must be requested themselves to regather the filth that has polluted our society.
America and Saudi spread in our country dangerous weapons and so-called "Jihadi", which is in reality hate-inciting and cultural virus enticing literature. Our country has become a human slaughterhouse because of this.
Due to the risk of attack from India, The Pakistani Army's announcement that it would remove forces from the Afghan border and post them at the Indian border, and the Taliban's announcement that it would handle the Afghan border caused America to stumble and pressure India not to attack Pakistan.
This showed the strength of America in the region.
Though India did not warn that they would attack, nor do they have that much courage.
The Taliban attacked and finished most of the remaining American supplies.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and tha Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi is the trade and financial center of Pakistan, and the Dubai of the backward regions.
Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty handed, but ever since the law and order situation in the western border regions was lost, all people diverted their attention here.
Now they want to kidnap this city.
Pathans are now called Pukhtons, made foreigners, and forced to fight, while the need in Pakistan is for unity.
One solution to the problem is to have the Urdu speak or learn Pushto or the Pushto to speak or learn Urdu. Alternatively, it would be best for everybody to learn English.
You must be thinking its a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
The cause of the torture is language.
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir in my childhood I had actually given the same suggestion many times to my friends ,which included people from every religion and rhetoric groups, but people used to laugh over these suggestions.
At that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not that evident but they were boiling up inside.
It is hard to understand what is happening and why.
Are these the signs of judgement day?
What are these innocent and innoxious people being killed for?
The reason is in front of everyone; there are those who want to break Pakistan into pieces and those who do all this neither belong to this religion nor this country.
Be it Karachi or Mumbai, the houses were set on fire by its own residents.
Which ever government comes to power changes the name of important infrastructure projects like airports, major roads and building. Presently this is the case, and buildings, airports etc, have been renamed as Baynazeer.
Does Baynzeer understand what is going on with the people of Karachi and Pakistan?
While the Mumbai attack was on peak, the initiative taken by RAW(Indian spy agency)to start sectarian violence was busted.  This event proves that in past, political figures on RAW's payroll have now given up the job.
Spilling of innocent blood of Pushto speaking people, and with India threatening many times, have awakened the Pakistani's from Karachi to Khyber.
All strict applause of anger from political, religious, sectarian and national bodies, is now teaching India the manners of diplomatic speech. They have provided American strategists a chance to think again.
Those responsible for the turmoil in Karachi, are Mutahida and Awami National Party ANP; where as the establishment is inclined towards one party and not neutral.
The establishment could have controlled the events in an hour but intentionally allowed to the event to escalate.
Police and rangers abstained from taking any action since they were under pressure from political parties.
The talks about a unity amongst political parties on the issue is limited to paper only. The party will have to forgo their own vested interests and work for the interests of a common man
Until there is pressure on the administration, these kinds of incidents will keep taking place.
To me, these people are the biggest terrorists.
Foreign powers are definitely involved in this, but no one knows who they are.
But, alas, if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done? Since it's not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
The government should operate here, saving a large and very important city of the country from terrorism.
Otherwise, Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
The BBC Urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure.  Pakistani media's condition is already weak.
The whole truth is on the BBC.
There are two solutions to the problem: to teach Pushto to Urdo speakers or to teach everyone English.
You might think that this is odd, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is funny?
Is the cause of extremism language?
They spilled blood in Karachi, and the story that each citizen was fearing for a long time was finally written.
No one left any stone unturned.  The reports that surfaced in the media only told 50% of what actually happened here in four days.
I have not slept in the last three nights, and I am still afraid.
The people who killed the cobblers and peanut sellers are those who evacuated the hotel.
The people who looted the super highway and cut the ears off of innocent people are all unaware of Allah's punishment, which can catch them anytime.
What do you think the reasons are for this sudden violence?
(BBC)
Keeping the heart rendering Mumbai attacks in view and diving to search for a cause for the violence in Karachi is not at all needed.  Rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in 'blood'.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, \the sun goes out of control.
The blood of the loyalists of Liaqat Ali Khan also belonged to the same place, but to eliminate Mr. Psycho's misunderstanding I am writing this verse.
We will also repeat our elders traditions.
We made it by sacrificing lives, and will save it by doing the same.
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
It is very disappointing that the whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
See Liaqat Ali Khan, you will find out that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family from Karnal, in Punjab.
Due to his steps for the migrants, today the migrants consider him as one of them.
There is always a reaction to every action.
One can afford on oneself.
Ejaz Aiwan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the graffiti of real gangsters these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan. They did not face any reaction.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
One Muslim League Q was left, and even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to the People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment to the National Assembly and the Senate.
Until now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment are a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in favor of this amendment, nor has anyone forced the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like after submitting the drafts of the 18th amendment, these parties have done their part. That is, they will be able to say tomorrow that they submitted the draft and the government speaker did not take any action.
MQM is the government in power, Muslim League N in the opposition and Muslim League Q the party who passed the 17th amendment; how is it possible that these parties will be sincere in finishing the 17th amendment?
This is what is called getting credit for nothing.
The people's party is already tardy about finishing the 17th amendment.
How can someone think of cutting off their own hands?
The 17th amendment will not be canceled until Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of the majority in our survey and it is also true.
If the 17th amendment was to be discarded, then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf. Because by supporting the president, he became the chairman of the People's Party.
The 17th amendment is valid until he is the president.
In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to bid Zardari farewell from the presidential house.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
Most of the elders in our family belonged to the working class.
During our childhood when our uncles did their work, we prayed to Allah to protect us from physical labor.
To avoid this we wrote to the editor of monthly Amroz to ask him what to do after matriculation so that we would not have to do physical labor.
In reply, the Editor wrote that we should become a Doctor or Engineer and study these courses.
We were inclined towards engineering and in matriculation we studied Technical drawing instead of Biology.
But at the time of admissions in FSc, our older brother forced us to study medical in FSc.
We had hardly studied biology for a month before we started studying math.
In order to avoid physical labor, we became engineers and we are in a better position than many friends in our family. We thank Allah for it.
We remembered this when with out 2 young sons we were trying to lift carpets of old hour.
It was only half an hour since he started working that the little boy said, "Daddy, I am not born to do this".
I said that if this is true, then study a lot like us and get rid of the physical labor.
The son said, "I am studying and I will get through it, but it is the work that I cannot do".
We did that work in three hours and came back home.
The point of this story is that if a person picks his destiny, whatever is the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving that destiny.
Here if you do not know what you have to do then may God help you!
It is said that you should not say bad things about the dead, but what shall we do? We see only bad things in Benazir, even on the anniversary of her first death.
Benazir, for her selfish purpose, crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs after giving the list of the names of those who were fighting for freedom. On the other hand, she gave India the chance to keep its full attention on Kashmir after helping to suppress the Punjab movement.
A tug-of-war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history and has pushed the country back many years.
Benazir continued to give negative comments on Kashmir and the nuclear program after being exiled.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
During the rule of Benazir, she gave her husband the freedom to make as much money as possible, which is why he is known as Mr. Ten Percent.
During Benazirs' rule, her brother was killed, but the murderers are still safe from any punishment.
Besides being a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for womens' rights.
Just like Benazir took over politics upon the death of her father, her widower has taken over politics at her death.
Benazir came into power twice, but she could not punish or register a case against  the culprits that murdered her father.
It has been 37 years since East Pakistan has been separated from us, but due to the extreme senselessness of our people and leaders we have never celebrated the mourning day.
Instead, we should have celebrated December 16th as Didactic Day and take measures so that this kind of incident doesn't take place again.
On this day we send greetings to the people of Bangladesh as we try to bring them closer to us again.
The rulers should reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
He planned on bringing back the people of Bihar, who were stuck in Bangladesh, and he would send them gifts to keep their spirits up.
We have become so insensitive in our neighborhood, that if someone dies, we are not even aware of it.
We do not care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
If a huge calamity passes by, we forget about it and by the next day we carry on with our normal life.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again, like East and West Germany had done.
If we sacrifice a little for each other and leave our selfishness behind us, we can again become one.
It doesn't look as if this dream will be fulfilled in the near future.
Today, it was announced in the news, that the governor of Illinois, in The United States, was caught on corruption charges.
He would soon be brought up on charges and forced to resign his position.  My American friend, who had knowledge of the political system in The U.S. And in Pakistan seemed embarrassed by this example of democracy.
In America, no one is above the law, not even government officials.
The other is your country, Pakistan, where even the President was chosen after the corruption charges against him were dropped.
My vein of loyalty throbbed and I said what is the big deal if a governor was arrested in America. In our Pakistan, once the Prime Minister was arrested and hanged overnight, and another time sent into exile.
Tell me, when did this happen in America?
In Pakistan, those who broke the law were sent out of the presidential palace with a guard of honor. Tell me when this happened in America.
The Chief Justice of Pakistan was removed in such a manner, that despite having public support, he could not be replaced until now. Has this happened in America?
In Pakistan, a fake-degree holder was made the Minister of Health. Did this happen in America?
Hearing this, the American laughed until he was tired and accepted defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded on all four sides by Americans.
It seems from his smile that.
he thinks America is with his government. He is forgetting that one year ago, they were with Pervez Musharraf.
The picture looks like that of a family.
Before that no picture as such has been published in which the President is in the company of 3 American authorities.
Look like that America's work has been increased in Pakistan and one and more Authorities are working on it or they might not believe that person as compared to the first one.
It might be possible that they have planned this also, keeping in mind President Zardari's promise of fulfillment.
Had he been an intelligent politician then he  would be at least not been smiling in this picture and his face would show some signs of embarrassment.
If the principle of democracy applied on this picture than President Zardari is in Minority
In Democracy Majority rules the Nation and who are they picture is showing
The  Swat ares of Pakistan is like heaven on earth and is also known as Switzerland.
Till now, according to the Government Policy, cross talks are  going along together with the use of power.
But the use of power is resulting in increasing the power of Taliban and increasing sympathy for Taliban.It is also not providing any benefits.
The government must, instead of using the power, eliminate the causes of the issue.
by eliminating the causes, Fazlullah and Taliban will automatically disperse.
the Sharia bill proposed by ANP will, to a great extent, become the solution of the problems of Swat.
But besides implementation of the Sharia, the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues.
At the beginning of General Musharaf rise, it looked like the nation had rid itself of the incompetent politicians, but the lust for power changed all his plans.
all the hopes were from the participation in the "War of terror", he had started considering himself immortal.
those steps which were expected, all broke-off.
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, made a deal with the thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army but never know what wass happening to the present government.
Either its Bajor or Swat, the army does not control terror but bombs the ""Enemy"" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy a mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy.
The conditions in the  terrorism struck area of Swat, in the Frontier Province, are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area
On tone side, the governments writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side the effect of Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everday in Swat.
On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.
The result is that on the one side, the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other hand, the Taliban has established their hold.
In between, who got grinded? The poor citizens.
It is said that in Swat somebody asked, which type of people are the Taliban are? The answer was  ""very good people because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country"".
Then asked how is the army, the answer was that the army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.
Then it was asked, who are the enemies of religion and country, the answer was it's citizens.
I am astonished, how the Pakistan Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban's.
They could not track down Taliban's illegally operated FM channel, which in my opinion is very easy.
But still, FM was spreading hatred in full swing.
Girls' schools as well as boys' schools are now being destroyed.
A curfew is imposed so that Talibans can move around easily.
Tonight 8 trucks entered the suburbs of Mingora during curfew and created bunkers.
The question is, how could they reach it during curfew?
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house and salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, someone tell this army to protect the helpless people of Sawat from the Taliban and prove that the Pakistan army can overcome any enemy.
He says that most of the blood is spilled in the name of religion. Tell me, if there was no religion, would blood not have spilled?
Punjabi, Pathan, White and Blank, Mehsood and other tribes: Are these the products of religion?
No, sir, no way! Only religion teaches that there is no black and white, there is no Punjabi and no immigrant. If it was not for religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between races, and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribe-brotherhood hatred.
Actually, only religion trains man's character and restricts him, as he has not come here on his own will, but rather the Creator of all that exists sent him here, and he must live here according to His commands.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France, for two years, I also felt the same way.
I do not know why people only expect us to call.
A resolution about Iraq, passed in a few hours, to send a 'peace' force to Darfur is not at all a problem.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where there is a matter of death, we are still holding meetings about that.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
is it really being waited to diminish.
so that no could again even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights.  (this is a fragment, we don't have a topic...why or who?  what was the action?)
when a father is running, carrying his beloved son's dead body, even then, your hearts don't pinch you with pain?
If not then, you don't even deserve to be called human being.
You become a black mottle over the name of humanity.
So at least it has been proven that this region has also been a homeland for Jews for centuries.
Ideally these two nations should have lived in harmony, but  their strings are in Western and Arab hands. So without their own will, peace can not prevail in this region.
And even now Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
Even if the Israeli operation stops temporarily, Tension is so high it will start again any moment after any incident.
BBC's own country has its interests related to America and Israel and this is why while taking cover of enlightened moderation, it has started a series of blogs on Jewism and this creates biased propaganda.
BBC is only completing a formality, and its goal and intent is to gather well wishes.
I request the moderator to publish this comment of Fidwi, so it be known that at least a little bit of affinity towards truth is still remaining in BBC
Thank You.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, Dracula's have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How could I not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time, including Derah Gahzi Khan, summer showers are taking place throughout the country.
Enjoy the weather along with this poem related to it.
The rains are present.
If it rains, it is spring.
If it stays, then it is peace.
Sometimes, it comes without a reason.
At times, it spreads over day and night
Sometimes, it is very noisy, and sometimes it is very quiet.
The rains are present.
in a memory, at a night
to a buried ash
Sometimes the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burned itself.
Sometimes each drop seems sorrowful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What it means to them is whether the country lasts or not.
Whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them.
Our media is corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday afternoon something surprising happened.
All around police are running here and there but not asking about illegal parking.
Moreover, the NYPD was not in a mood to look at illegally parked cars.
It happened that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in the Hudson River.
Until now, it was just known that the "terrorists" were related to birds.
Yesterday was maybe New York's most historic cold.
Temperatures do not drop to this degree.
My jaw is beginning to hurt after a half an hour stroll outside.
Imagine what would have happened to those people who jumped from the plane into the river.
The happy news is that the people all together stayed safe.
Sad news is that the company sank like a ship in this financial crisis.
I went by the West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I still do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, during my one-hour trip the way had opened at least a bit, so I was able to use the 56th street exit.
When I saw the lines waiting at them, I had not taken the previous two exits.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women.
Shaguftah: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak, to you too.
Sarah: I have slaughtered two chickens and how they are slaughtered and Jahanzeb has already mentioned how I did it.
Apart from this, there is no other way to do it.
At this farm one has to get his own meat done, including removing the skin.
Basim.Net might take some to repair.
What happened on the forum?
Linko
In order to work with Listen to Blog, see it in Fire Fox.
Duffer: Same to you. Eid greetings to you.
Sir please use Fire Fox.
The snow will vanish.
We unnecessarily kept thinking of these Taliban of Swat as indelicate, but who were only unhappy over women's education.
They kept expressing their grief by demolishing a womens schools and college somewhere every day.
But just like other ideas, this idea did not also come true. According to this report by CNN, today on the sacred day of Monday, this Taliban gang of Swat have blasted a boy's school.
The Taliban has destroyed a boys school in Swat.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First".  I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation of the Taliban being against girls education is not true.
Rather, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government less.
May He help them in uprooting the evil government.
Amen, Amen.
Masha Allah, up until now 182 schools have been destroyed.
The stories about various Muslim customs like fixing marriages before birth, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the supposed statements by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight, were not exaggerations.  There was recently a news story from India about a girl who was married to a frog.
See a picture of the bride at the marriage.
Just a while before this, the wedding of a girl with a dog took place.
Look at the groom.
Humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
It is the era of computers and its involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life.
Many people have many reservation over this increasing involvement of computers. For example, in financial matters,
where use of credit cards bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
So now, only through your financial matters, like through your credit card, you can be located.
And in the future, when use of real currency will be reduced a great extent, its benefits will increase more and more.
Similarly, in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, the credit card information is stolen.
Similarly computers have become the source of friendship.
Social networking sites such as Orkut, Facebook and Myspace have achieved an initial level of acceptance.
Yet, do you think it's possible that the more we use these social networking sites, the further we distance ourselves from people in real life?
Also consider match-making websites, where your preferences are matched to a list of people with similar desires as you.
But do you want to live with a person who is just like you?
I know that I would not want to.  Why else would a spouse be called the better half
unless they can get rid of the faults within me?
Perhaps I have some good sense.
I used to believe that anything that someone older than me said was true.
In the same way, I thought my father knew the answer to every question on earth.
I even used to get laughed at a lot for this.
But only that saying seemed true which could be possible.
The lie caused such an irritation but what was the reason to lie.
Bore loss on that saying even at this age
At the very least in my opinion you should lie.
If you misguide and be untruthful Allah knows.
Work will finish when we pray to Allah.
Allah knows the states intention.
The distance from religion causes disgust.
A minor child should also stay with parent or guardian according to Muslim and Pakistani law.
Their expense is due to their father and father can meet with children.
Then when they become mature, they can live with whom they want.
The actual problems are the relatives who misguide them.
Feudalism has overshadowed our deeds.
Even here is thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in father's property so it is resisted, although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated.
These restrictions regarding relations have created many evils in society.
Concept of remarriage of a divorced women, or a widow is becoming rare.
Due to these unnecessary beliefs and traditions, the family system is facing disarray.
Why is it in our society, if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarries, it is not appreciated?
A Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago,  had all his children married, but when he married a widow, his own children went against him.
In my opinion, this is due to religion, is it not?
What type of mentality is the "'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place" kind of mentality?
I believe that this person's children should have thought what's wrong if he married a widow after he married off all his children?
This widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
As the children would get busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow, if their wives refuse to look after them when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society we are facing for the last 40-50 years.
A wife can accept that her husband has illicit relations, but she cannot stand him having a second wife.
If possible, stop him from doing so even after you die.
She destroys her husband and her own hereafter, and becomes a cause for spreading filth in society.
When chanting Islam, it does not mean anything. In reality, we only like our culture and traditions.
For instance, we try to keep girls from gaining education and are fearful of allowing a girl to marry someone of her choice.
As for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house, it was so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax, (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt).
In the Indo Pak subcontinent, Islam was accepted centuries ago, but it could not leave its ignorant mentality and has always kept culture and tradition above Islam.
Think of a man's second marriage as an innovation, divorce as a clinical rest, and divorced woman as untouchable. You must love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife. It is all a part of this mentality.
What's more, in mimicry of the western countries, we have started to consider piety and veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam is easy, but leaving this mentality is very difficult.
Allah, please grant us the spirit and courage needed for this.
Amen
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.
Centuries passed with very little written
Yet, what was written said much.
Allah Hafiz
Ameer Taimoor, in his book "I am Taimoor," writes how he discovered the secret that if the leader of any army offers himself up for the front line, that army will never lose.
But here, the situation is different.
Though it's said that the common people are there to die for us, if we die, it's considered martyrdom.
Yet, if a common person dies it should be considered murder.
May peace and blessing of the Almighty be with you.
I was coming back to my shop after the Isha prayer tonight and a man who was sitting in his car waved at me and called me over.
I thought that this man was probably lost or wanted to ask me a question. I looked in and his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked me if I could speak and understand Arabic, and I told him that I could.
He started telling that he came from Riyadh when he was in Medina someone picked-pocketed him and he needed help. I gave the man 12 riyals so that he could reach Riyadh, but I saw him telling the same story to others as he drove up a little farther.
I became furious and cursed at the man and threatened that I would call the Police.  Upon which, he ran away.
This is the situation of many Muslims these days.  By begging with families they can make at least 2 to 3 thousand a day.
However there is a clear Hadith (SAAW) that the upper hand is better than the lower hand since the lower hand is the begging one and the upper hand is the giving one.
May Allah bless us and make us true Muslims (Amen).
Wassalam.

The wife of famous singer Adnan Sami approached a Police Station in Mumbai; accusing him of torture.
The Police Station advised her to approach the court.
Saba Galadari, the wife of Adnan Sami, gave an application against her husband that Adnan Sami continuously tortures her.
He is also administering in human behavior against her.
Now this thing has gone out of her tolerance, therefore, a case may be registered against Adnan Sami.
The police  station has advised her to approach the court instead of registering  the case, on the plea that the case is not within the valid jurisdiction of the police station.
Do you think that the accusation on Adnan Sami by his wife is correct?
Can this accusation be an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Inform us about your opinion on the Subject.
Adam Sanghad Mehr.
As far as making accusations, anyone can accuse the other.
To become enraged due to defending honor is not sensible.
Whatever be the case between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he had left his honorable life and went to India to earn money. Now that fame has fallen around his neck.
This is the result of his own actions.
Washington...
The Secretary of State of the United States of America, Hilary Clinton, says "President Obama will take a strong stand against Afghan President Hamid Karzai."
In America's new policy towards Afghanistan, war will be given more importance than economic developement.
The envoy to Afghanistan say that Hamid Karzai is considered a barrier to the achievement of American goals in Afghanistan. The corruption in the Afghanistan government and the business of middlemen has increased, and the Taliban are once more gathering strength.
The American envoy stated that among the people in the American government who are pressing President Hamid Karzai to do something more are, America's Vice President Joseph Biden and President Obama's representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Hallbrooke.
He said that this good administration was noticed after President Bush left, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai every 2 weeks, which used to emphasize the role of America in Afghanistan and the development of its city departments.
Officials say that the Obama administration will work with state leaders as a backup to the main government.
Officials say that they will emphasize to Hamid Karzai the importance of fighting against corruption.
Hamid Karzai faces new elections this year. It is not yet clear whether Obama and his administration will favor his re-election or not.
Is this statement of the American officials a forecast of change in America's policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is this era of Hamid Karzai ending?
What are your thoughts in this matter?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan with a score of 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka in the first day's match, but Sri Lanka won the next two matches.
In the third match, the nation's team performance was very poor. They scored only 75 runs in 23 overs against 309 runs made by the national team of Sri Lanka, and this is how we were defeated.
The result of the series proves that the national team has no consistency in its performance.
Besides having the home ground and all other claims, the national team was defeated. What are the reasons of this in your opinion?
Which departments of the game should be addressed more by the authorities?
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
Which department will you hold responsible for the defeat - fielding, batting or bowling?
Please provide your feedback.
It is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish traditions continue. These feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule, so who would call them Muslims?
A Sardar should walk himself over these embers. Why doesn't the present government act against them?
That is when the judicial justice will come in handy.
The Srilankan cricket team has now arrived in Karachi to play One Day internationals.
Besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
Upon reaching the Karachi airport, the Sri Lankan team was very warmly welcomed.
Two days between Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be played in Karachi whereas the third day will be played in Lahore.
Both teams have their claims over bowling, batting and fielding.
If the Sri Lankans are proud of their spinners, the Pakistanis trust their fast bowlers.
Sri Lankan Captain Mahela Jayvardena has said that not a single player from the Pakistan team is dangerous, but the whole team is dangerous.
Murli Dharan and Mendis will be the trump cards, whereas the Pakistan captain says that it will be a tough competition.
Shoaib Malik has said that we have played Murli Dharan and we'll see Mendis as well. We have prepared a secret game plan and we shall implement that on the ground.
Will the Pak-Sri Lanka series be really as interesting and exciting as the claims are?
Who will dominate the series between Pakistan and Sri Lanka?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the most valuable player of the series?
Let us know your opinion.
Gulfam, London, Publish statements that are of liking, you give preference to We would like you to write the truth.  Do not entangle the statement like Mukher Jee, because it is commanded to say truth in front of tyrant and it is equal to Crusade(Jihad). What to say of Mukher Jee, change the statement between news and try to weep.

It is all these people's doing Kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years.
No, no one  asked.  Now, they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism.  So, they have started talking about peace and settlement.
First, they generally massacred Muslims.  Now, they are perplexed, attempting to settle the matter.
In a way, Pakistan has to understand their own duplicitous policies.
Asad Khan, London
India is creating this situation to distract the world attention away from the Kashmir issue.
Pakistan has always shown the true face of India to the world.
Now the British government has realized that the Indian government is maligning Pakistan for terrorism so that it can occupy Kashmir.
They are unwilling to talk with Pakistan on this matter.
British Foreign Minister, David Miliband, has said that by resolving the Kashmir issue it will end extremism. The the Pakistan government will be able to handle the border issues.
It should be noted that American President Obama has already expressed similar views on the Kashmir issue.
British Foreign Minister has said, while talking to media in Mumbai and also written in an essay, that the idea of war on terror is wrong. On the basis of threat to oneself, killing others was Bush's policy.
David Miliband has said that Pakistan should show leniency towards extremist groups.
Due to insistence of major powers to resolve the Kashmir issue, India is now creating unrest in the region to distract the world from this issue.
The terrorist attack in Mumbai is also a part of this strategy.
Is India using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialog?
Let us know of your opinion.
Usman Aftab,
I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
Rather it wants to keep it in check, and hence is thinking of taking certain steps. They know that Pakistan is a nuclear state.
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries are only thinking that if they corner Pakistan, they would face some political and geographic problems. They want to help Pakistan, but also want to be successful in their goal.
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife, and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn Pakistan.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian army chief should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.

This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but we know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is in hot water.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The prime minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani, said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden, played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing him with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the Parliament.
The prime minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers' movement not played any role?
What do you have to say about this statement, in regards to the Prime Minister?
Make us aware of your opinion.
American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference, advised newly elected President, Barack Obama. Former president G.W. Bush said that he had made many mistakes in his presidency and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
'I did, as a president, whatever I felt was appropriate, according to the situation, and the American law and constitution, giving preference to American interest over my own acceptance'.
President Bush said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him, and considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this would be his last press conference, and thanked the journalists and other friends who were present in the press conference.
Do you think Obama will repeat the mistakes that Bush made?
Did Bush delay accepting his mistake?
Will Obama be able to follow Bush's advice?
Give us your opinion.
American Vice President Dick Cheney said, "I want to see Osama Bin Laden alive or dead."
He said that Osama Bin Laden is hiding in some hard to reach area and is of no use to his organization, and if Osama Bin Laden is arrested alive or dead then his organization must be destroyed.
America intends to arrest Osama and the search for Osama is on.
Will Dick Cheney's goal to arrest Osama be accomplished?

After the completion of Quaid Azam Trophy match between PIA and Habib Bank, the all-rounder cricketer Shahid Affridi had a altercation with one fan.
When Shahid Affridi came out of the drawing room after playing the match on the UBL ground, a large number of fans gathered around him.
In one instance, a fan held his hand and asked to take a photo with him, after which Shahid Affridi removed his hand from the fan's and said that he can take the photo tomorrow. After further insistence from the fan, Affridi became angry and slapped him. An altercation then began between Affridi and the fan, though the crowd seemed to dismiss the matter there.
Shahid Affridi later said that he had been in a hurry to attend the prayer.
Nevertheless, I shall apologize to that spectator.
What would you say about this behavior of Shahid Afridi?

The Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, has once again accused Pakistan of provoking a war.
Pakistan is using terrorism as a state policy.
While addressing a Chief Minister's conference in New Delhi, Manmohan Singh said that the terrorist elements are backed by neighboring countries and especially Pakistan.
The terrorists of the Mumbai attacks used the far out to sea route and were safe from the Indian coast guards.
The Indian Prime Minister said that the November attacks were carried out by Lashkare Taiba.
He added that the terrorists are using modern techniques and the latest communication systems and said, "We'll have to be more rigorous over the line of control where the intrusion takes place". He said that terrorism will not be tolerated in any case and that is their policy.
How do you see this allegation from the Indian Prime Minister?
Do not the internal chaos and separation movements of India show India's anxiety?
On whose signals has India chosen to have a threatening attitude?

This is a very hurtful incident that Israel is publicly massacring the Palestinians; the same situation is here in Kashmir but the Security Council does not even bother with it.
As many organizations who are in Palestine and Kashmir should continue their fight till freedom and by creating unity between themselves keep fighting every kind of aggression, one of these days their Martyr will bring result. By the will of Allah
Israeli air attacks still continue in Gaza, as now several Palestinian Men, Women and children have been murdered.
Important political leader Hamas Nazarian has been martyred with his wife and kids.
Their meeting of the Security Council ended without any decision.
The condemning resolution presented by Libia and other Arab countries against Israel is facing American opposition in the meeting.
For the last few days there have been bombings by Israeli planes on the Palestinian civilian population.
The whole world cried out about the Mumbai issue, but the Israeli attacks do not seem to matter to anyone including America and Britain.
Why are the important Islamic countries quiet?
What can say about this double standard of the world?
Saeed, New York
I think that most of our people are ignorant. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties. The electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has taken a serious position.
On the other side, there was an increase of an average of 18% in gas rates, while the unavailability of petrol in some cities has become a cause of great difficulty for the public.
Among the manufacturing and business circles, there are strong protests and severe protests against the long power cut and gas crisis.
The producers have given the ultimatum to close the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is annoyed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
Production has become practically paralyzed.
The government institutions are blaming each other to express their positions.
Are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas not a joke against the nation?
Shouldn't more attention should be given to solving the problems?
Are the wheels of national development not seeming jammed to the government?
What immediate steps can you suggest to gain control over this crisis?
Please let us know your opinions.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that government is carrying slogan of public service is itself hurting them.
The unavailability of electricity, gas, and petrol has become a persecution.
Government has no control over the institutions.
Law and order is deteriorating every day, may Allah bestow his mercy on this country.
The new year has started.
Last year was the year of outbreaks and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered in reference to the terrorism.
The stepping down of President Musharf and the end of the eight years rule of president Bush; throwing of shoes on Bush and formation of democratic government in Pakistan; calamities; earthquake in Baluchistan; global financial slump and monopoly.
The new year is arriving, how do you foresee it?
In your opinion, what will be the result of the political or geographical situation? What will be Obama's strategy?
Is there a hope of a development towards eliminating terrorism?
Will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?
What position will the Indo-Pak relation take?
Is there a chance of surgical strikes or a full fledged war?
What are your expectations for the new year?
Please provide your feedback.
First anniversary of the death of Benazir Bhutto Shaheed is being celebrated. She was martyred on 27th of December, 2007 after a  congregation at the Liaqat Bagh in Rawalpindi.
Benazir's presence will be missed. She was a statesman, politician and world famous personality that held a unique status in national politics.
One year has gone by but the mystery of her martyrdom has not yet been resolved.
Her efforts in bringing democracy in Pakistan and the formation of government have not gone in vain.
Today, Pakistan has a democratic government and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, is holding the chair of the president.
how do you see Shaheed Benazir's role in Pakistan's politics?
Who can be behind her martyrdom?
she was recently awarded with the global award for human rights. what would you like to say about her political and democratic services.
after ruling America for 8 years, president Bush has departed from the White House and shifted to the president camp office in Camp David so that the White House can be renovated according to the new president Barak Obama's likings.
During Bush's eight years rule, the historical attacks and destruction of the World Trade Center, attack on Pentagon and then in the name of war against terror, attacking Afghanistan and Iraq and involving forces from other countries into the war and use of American resources in it have become memorable examples of his time.
due to this war America itself faced the worst ever economical and financial crisis in history.
what do you think the world achieved and lost through this war?
were the policies of Bush successful?
What is your opinion on president Bush's rule?
The Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one-day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, when interviewed by Jeev News, said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour.  Due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip due to the present political situation a proper step? Shouldn't sports be separate from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that the security conditions are so bad in India, the England cricket team is continuing its tour. So why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this matter?

Their are people who are proud about going to India.
They make their films and videos over there. Their eyes should now be open to how much the people of India respect them.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami knows that he should come to Pakistan at the first opportunity because respect was not given to him even there.

Indian's attitudes have changed after the Mumbai attack.
Jagjit showed his reaction to this by hating Pakistan and the Pakistani people.
It should be known that Adnan Sami sung seven songs of Asha Bhosla, and now how can he be out of tune? Adnan Sami should stay in India. There is no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam
I will only say this about the statement of Jagjit Singh - he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements suitable to the situation? Pakistanis - open your eyes. How much are you given worth in India? Try to understand the thinking of Hindu.
After the Mumbai incident, their hateful statements have increased, and now they are spitting poison against popular singer Adnan Sami.
according to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said ""You dog this is a farewell kiss""
after this the journalist removed his shoe and threw it at Bush. President Bush saved himself and expertly ducked before the shoe couldstrike him.
The second shoe hit the American Flag.
Security personnel dragged the journalist away from the room.
At this point, President Bush stated that he didn't know why he had done so, the shoe was a size ten 10 I had no problem.
Do you think this reaction of the journalist was an expression of deprecation for President Bush from the Iraqi people?
What is your impression of this incident?
The tension between Pakistan and India's relations after the terrorism in Mumbai became intensified when fighter planes from the Indian Air Force violated the Pakistani airspace in the Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
As a result of the retaliation from Pak Air Force, the Indian planes were forced to go turn around.
Sources confirm that both Indian planes were loaded with ammunition.
This is the first incident if it's kind in the current tense situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that they are all set for the country's air defense.
Information Minister, Sherry Rahman, says that Indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed. Although, this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
In your opinion, does India really have an intention of air strike on Pakistan?
Is this statement of India correct?  That this violation was a mistake, or this was to find out the ability of Pakistan's Air force.
Is this incident going to aggravate the current estrangement among the two countries?
Please inform us with your comments.
Respected martyr, Benazir Bhutto, was given the International Award for Human Rights after her death, which was received by her son and chairperson of the People's Party, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
During a session of General Assembly in the United Nations headquarters, former prime minister of Pakistan, martyr Benazir Bhutto, was presented with this award for acknowledgment of her efforts for human rights in a ceremony.
The 60th anniversary of the passing of the human rights resolution by the United Nations was celebrated on the 10th of December.
Among those people and institutes being honored on the occasion for working for human rights, apart from Benazir Bhutto, were:  former American Attorney General, Louis Ramsey Clark, and the Human Rights Watch, the organization that works around the world for human rights.
On this occasion, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations Abdullah Husain Harun and other senior embassy agents were present.
What do you think about the former martyr Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto receiving this award?
Samir
Chicago
It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she completely changed.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party and made her son the representative of the People's Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi, This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
But until the iron ax is not fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are just like this, that they are adopting secretive ways. This is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations have included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed as well as two other Pakistani citizens and the name of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organisations into the list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaidah and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, practically non-existent organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba Operation Chief, Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organisations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organisations, they will be restricted from traveling and will be under arrest.
They will have to face cases.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India accusing these organizations of responsibility for the Mumbai Attacks without any proof?
Doesn't India have any local terrorist groups ?
Aren't the world organizations aware of the persecution of minorities in India?
