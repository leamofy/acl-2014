Abstention from dieting in order to avoid Flu.
This research from the American Scientists has come up after the experiments on rats.
It has been proven by experiments that rats put on diets with fewer calories were more prone to the Flu virus.
Research has proven the old myth  of fasting during fever wrong.
According to scientists, one should eat a lot during fever.

According to Professor Elizabeth Gardner, people who diet will not be affected with flu sooner but they will need more time to recover from it.
She also said that those people who receive the flu vaccine should also avoid dieting during the winter months.
'First nuclear experiment was done in 1990'
Thomas Reid, who has worked in the Lever National Laboratory in America as a weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the former director of technical intelligence at Los Alamos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.
This book was titled "Nuclear Express: Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation," and both writers have claimed that whichever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or had the support of another nuclear power.
In an interview with U.S. news agencies, Thomas Reid said that in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's rule, China experimented with Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Thomas Reid said that for many reasons, he believes that China had experimented with Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
The reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.
He further added that this was the reason that in 1998 in a span of only two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments in response to Indian nuclear experiments.
Thomas Reid reminds us that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiments.
He said further that in May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with care, and Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.
When Thomas Reed was asked if China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan, he replied that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.
He said  evidence was also present that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan had used the Chinese model. Later the Libyan documents confirmed this.
Another question was about mutual nuclear experiment. He replied that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.
He said Israel was predicted to have access to the results of this experiment.
Thomas Reeds was also asked if China was continuing nuclear proliferation.
On this Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and the design to an Iranian nuclear facility in Asfahan.
Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.
He said that China had been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Rome, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen via North Korea.

Protest Against the Removal of Journalists
On Tuesday the organization of journalists RIUJ held protests in front of the Islamabad Press Club against media owners and the government about the news channel and newspapers removing many of their employees.
Speaking to the protesters, senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, Federal Union of Journalists, C.R. Shamsi said that the politicians used to protest with us until yesterday on the streets, today they have become rulers and are sitting in the parliament. Fearing a certain lobby of the media owners, they are not doing anything for the rights of the journalists.
He said that the newspaper owners who speak of human rights have made their offices punishment houses and beggar camps, where despite earning millions of rupees per year, the workers are given meager wages and by removing hundreds of them, they are killing them economically.
An example of this is in front of us of the worker of a private TV channel, Channel 5, in Lahore, who committed suicide over not getting his salary for four months. And even today, due to being unfairly removed or not getting salaries for months, many workers are leading very difficult lives.
He said that there should be firm steps taken against the TV and newspaper owners, and the journalists should put a protest camp in front of the parliament to get their rights.
C.R. Shamsi criticized the governor of Punjab, Salman Taseer, saying that employees were removed from his Urdu Newspaper "Aaj Kal" staff without prior notice.
Wheras Junah daily, Khabrein daily, Channel 5, Burns Plus TV and Aaj TV have removed dozens of workers.
Speaking to the protestors, the General Secretary of PUFJ said that today, throughout the country, journalist organizations are observing a black day against the removal of journalists and newspaper workers, whereas journalists will go to the parliamentary session wearing black bands on their arms to get back their rights.
According to Mazhar Abbas, in 50% of the Pakistani newspapers and TV channels the workers and journalists were being exploited, where they work without any agreement.
He said that until now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been removed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is being feared that the owners will remove hundreds more in the present year, making an excuse of the present financial crisis.
Mazhar Abbas said that the journalist movement will continue until removed employees are reinstated, newspaper wages fixed by the Seventh Wage board award are enforced, and the salaries owed by TV channels and newspaper workers is paid.

Meanwhile, Sarbaz Baloch, presenting himself as a representative of the banned Baloch Republican army has accepted the responsibility of the blast on behalf of his organization over the telephone.
It is the fourth pipeline that has been blasted in four days.
On Friday an 18 inch diameter pipeline was blasted in Dera Allahyar whose repair work was continued till Sunday morning.
General Manager of Sui Southern Gas in Quetta, Mushtaq Siddiqui has told that supply from this pipeline will resume in the afternoon.
This pipeline reached Quetta through Sibbi.
Quetta: Zyarat and other surrounding areas have an extreme shortage of natural gas for three days. On one side the snowfall continues and the temperature has dropped below freezing; the other side is where the stoves and heaters have gone cold.
In addition, there was a bomb blast in a motorcycle in Mal Mandi in the city of Dera Bugti. But according to the police, there was no fatality as a result of this blast.
Administrator for Jamat-ud-Dawa
The headquarter of Jamat-ud-Dawa, Tayyaba Center, is almost 25 kilometers away from Lahore near Mureedkay.
This center has a hospital, a school and also a hostel for students.
The law minister of Punjab, Rana Sanaullah Khan, says that the assignment of a superintendent in the Jamat-ud-Dawa center came into being so that the work of the welfare organizations present there is not disturbed.
According to Khalid Waleed, the son-in-law of Chief of Jamat-ud-Dawa Hafiz Saeed, qualified government official Khaqan Babar is appointed as an administrator to monitor the hospital, schools and other welfare organizations located in the center. Although, according to them, there has also been an increase in the police staff.
The Security Council of the United Nations has placed restrictions on Jamat-ud-Dawa after which Pakistan's federal government did an operation against Jamat-ud-Dawa in the entire country. Many leaders were placed under house arrest, including Ameer Hafiz Saeed. The assignment of an administrator in the Tayyaba center from the government of Punjab was also part of the series of actions by the federal government against Jamat-ud-Dawa.
Khaqan Babar is related to DMG (District Management Group).
Hafiz Khalid Waleed has said that Lahore division commissioner Khusro Parvez Khan came to the Tayyaba Center on Sunday with the police and civil authorities and inspected several parts of the center. Khalid Waleed has disapproved of placement of an administrator from the government in the Jamat-ud-Dawa Center. It is also said that earlier operations of the government have already decreased the number of patients in the hospital and students in the school.
According to a press release by Jamat-ud-Dawa, party chief Hafiz Saeed has written a letter for the General Secretary of United Nations, Ban Ki Mon, and Committee for Taliban, in which a request is made to cancel the restrictions on the party made by the Security Council.
It says in the letter that the one sided decision of the Security Council on banning Jamat-ud-Dawa is unfair. And Jamat-ud-Dawa has no relation with terrorism but it is busy in charitable activities.

Four more ministers in the cabinet, total of sixty three
The four new federal ministers include two from the Mutahida Qaumi Movement and two from the Jamiat Ulamae Islam Fazalur Rehman Group.
President Asif Ali Zardari took the oath from the new ministers.
Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and members of cabinet were also present at the oath-taking ceremony.

Ministers Farooq Sattar and Babar Ghouri are from MQM, whereas Ministers Azam Swati and Molana Ataur Rehman are from the Jamiat Ulamae Islam Fazalur Rehman Group.
The departments of these ministers have not yet been announced.
Farooq Sattar is the convener of MQM, whereas Babar Ghouri is a senator from MQM whose term will expire on March 10.
Azam Swati was elected as a free senator and is considered to be one of the richest.
Moulana Ata-ur-Rahman is a member of the National Assembly and also Moulana Fazal-ur-Rahman's younger brother.
Remember that four statesmen holding posts in important ministries are not members of the National Assembly.

Bolochistan, Blasted Pipeline
According to police, this is a 18-inch diameter pipeline which connects different wells of Parekoh and meets the Suyi gas pipeline. This was blasted by unidentified men in the early morning.
Apart from this, yesterday, well number 3 near Suyi had been totally destroyed by a blast and a gas pipeline near Dera-allayar was also damaged due to a blast.
Militant organization Baloch republican army's spokeperson, Saryaz Baluch, accepted the responsibility for these blasts on the behalf of his organization.
As 2009 began, there was an increase in violent incidents in Baluchistan.
This month, until now, several gas pipelines have been blasted.  Attacks on trains and on people belonging to the Punjab region have also increased.
Though the Prime Minister of Baluchistan, Nawab Aslam Rayisani, has expressed concern over such activities and ordered the police to exchange information from intelligence agencies, stopping such incidents has not been possible yet.
$819 billion economic revival package approved
No member of the Republican party voted for President Obama's plan.
Members of the Republican Party said that the economic plan is very expensive and will not prove effective.
240 votes were cast in favor of this package in the members assembly whereas 160 were cast against it.
This economic revival plan will be presented next week in the Senate where the ruling Democratic party has very little majority.
Concern is being expressed that great opposition from the Republican Party may make it difficult to obtain Senate approval.
After the approval of economic revival plan, Barack Obama insisted that this important plan should not cause political disagreement.
The president said that this plan, which hoped would be enacted by next month, will prove to make a peaceful atmosphere in the country and enhance the American economy.
According to this plan, the public will be forgiven of loans from $275 billion to $540 billion for roads, bridges, 10,000 schools, unemployment benefits and research for new technology.
BBC writer Richard Luster has said in Washington that Barack Obama intended to introduce a new political culture by eliminating political disagreements, but discussion about this economic package has once again made politicians sore.
Republican members of the senate called the proposed bill a waste of government money, and said that it will not help in creating new employment opportunities.
They instead stressed the bill passed by their own party, in which more importance was given to tax cuts.
They said that more employment opportunities could be formed with less capital through their bill.
They said that compared to constructive plans, more employment opportunities could be formed through tax cuts.
Bitterness between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister
Nearly screaming, Recep Tayyip Erdogan told the Israeli president that the blood of many humans were spilled in Gaza, and it saddened him to see that people could watch this armed killing from Israel and clap in agreement.
Mr. Erdogan said that ""I believe that you are using such words to publicly ease your guilty conscience.  But you killed those people, and I will not forget those children who were killed near the shore.""
Simon said that Gaza's calamity is not due to Israel, but rather Hamas, who have established a dangerous dictatorship over there.
A BBC journalist from Davos said that he had never seen such a scene in an global economic forum before.
However, Erdogan later stated that he respected the aged Israeli president, falsely claiming that he was not yelling at him.
Turkey is one of the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, but for the last few years there has been tension between them.
The attacks were not planned in Pakistan.
Speaking to Indian news channel, NDTV, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said that the report of the Pakistani investigations into the Mumbai blast will be prepared soon.
In the attacks that took place in Mumbai, last Novemeber, more than 170 persons were killed.
India claims that the responsibility for the attacks belongs to the extremist group, Lashkar-e-Taiba.
India also said that Pakistani 'state factors' were guilty in the Mumbai attacks.
After the Mumbai attacks, the relations between the two countries were affected.
The high commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan gave his first statement about the report of the Pakistani investigations, from which it becomes evident as to what is within the report.
Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that as far as investigation has gone, Pakistani land has not been used.
It must be some other place, not England either.
These are the two places (Pakistan and Britain) about which I was worried.
India and the international community have created a lot of pressure on Pakistan to take action against the culprits of the Mumbai attacks.
Wajid Shamsul Haq said: We are not trying to cover it up.
We believe in taking action based on facts.
The world will accept our investigations.
We will try to satisfy India over the results of the investigation.
While defending the delay in the investigation in Pakistan, he said that it takes time to collect, understand and check these kind of things.
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Haq said that it took 45 days for India to present its dossier.
A black man elected as the republican leader too.
In the sixth round of elections in the Republican party, Michael Steel has won, receiving 91 votes out of 168.
During the  election for the position of chairman of the party, Katen Dawsen, candidate opposite to Steel, was given 70 votes. Whereas, former chairman Dunken abdicated from the competition in the second round.
People say that of the five candidates who ran for the position of the chairmanship of the republican party, Michael Steel was considered the most conservative among them.
After his win, Michael Steel said in his speech "We are saying to our friends and enemies together, come with us, but those who will cause problems in this, be prepared to separate from us." Michael Steel is from Maryland, where he has also been the deputy governor.
He became famous in 2006 when he ran for a seat in the senate.
But after losing in the senate elections he was appointed as the chairman of one political conservative committee of the party.
Now after being selected as the chairman of the party, the efforts of the Republican Party campaign in the entire country will be under his supervision.
He fought elections for this promise that he will give the party a new cause. And that he will use a new technique to join conservative supporters to the party.
Indian claims presence of Lashker-e-Tayyaba and Josh-e-Muhammad in Jammu.
There are reports that terrorists are present in the Poonch tribal area of Jammu.
According to official sources, police and the army surrounded the area and started the search upon receiving secret information.
During this, a fight started in which four militants, two soldiers and one policeman were killed.
According to the sources, fights were going on until the last news broke.  In this area, where militants associated with Lashker-e-Tayyaba and Josh-e-Muhammad are present, more soldiers have been sent to fight them.
During this, chief minister Omer Abdullah, nominated by the involved officials, met with the governor.  He directly gave the news of the Assembly leader's election from his party national conference.
Congress, the ally of the National Conference, also informed the governor of their advocacy of Omar Abdullah.
Omar Abdullah will take oath as the chief minister of the state.
Remember, the National Conference became the biggest party by gaining 28 seats in the 87 member assembly in the current state elections. Keep in mind that separatist parties boycotted the elections.
Congress, which secured 17 seats, accepted to form a coalition government with the National Conference.
Today, party workers welcomed Omar Abdullah with great fanfare on his arrival in Srinagar.
On this occasion, Omar Abdullah says that he will play his role in making the talks possible between the Indian government and separatists. However, this will not be possible until the elections in India and formation of the new government.
Role of EU for Peace in the Middle East.
From the official point of view, the role of the European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
According to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
The European Union's spokesman, Amadeu Altafaj, has said that every such effort is appreciated which is helpful in sending the European Union's message to the opponents of the war.
It seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned.
In reality, the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
As the head of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is even weaker than before.
Also, the internal issues have made it helpless.
On the other hand, the French President, Sarkozy, is behaving as if he is still the President of the European Union.
France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role, and he is capable of it, but he does not have the permission to do so.
The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, is faced with a strange situation.
He is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of the Czech Republic, Schwarzenberg.
The problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the Middle East war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense, whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. Moreover, Germany has sent its special ambassador to the Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.
Its proof is the Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.
This is a golden chance for the European Union to do something since America, due to the policies of George W. Bush, has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial Crisis: Suicide of a billionaire German industrialist.
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany, left a huge business group behind him.
But, a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.
When he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines. Then he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkle group had to face the loss of a few hundred million euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 million to one billion euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle was under intense pressure.
Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had got to this position from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic power.
After the death of his father, Adolf Merkel took over his family business and developed it quickly, putting on new lines.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 billion and 6 billion euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion euros a year. After the superb success of Ratiopharm, the Merkel Group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel Group around the world is near 100,000, and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical company Ratiopharm, always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years."
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have approved 400 million euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.
After the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain the same.
Crime rate among the immigrants in Germany.
According to the fresh statistics, crime rate among the immigrants from 2004 to 2007 is
Reduced from 9.22%
to 4.21%
According to Joachim Herrmann, the interior minister of Baweria province, this is a positive change.
He said: "It is important to note that the number of foreigners getting German citizenship is increasing."
Therefore it should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German, his background is foreign.
Herrmann said that his province will take this in to account when gathering statistics in 2010.
Besides Baweria, Hamburg is also thinking in the same lines.
A senator for foreign affairs from CDU, Christoph Ahlhaus, has said: "When research is done in a scientific manner, man can not pre-decide its results but it is based on the facts and figures that come out as a result of the research."
Ahlhaus diverted attention to a research report from the anti-crime provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamburg, it was discovered that out of all crimes happening there is a percentage that have the involvement of foreigners.
results showed that the foreigners here have
Tthe crime rate was less as compared to crime all over the province.
By contrast, when a survey was done in 2006 on crimes in youth in Berlin, it was determined that young people having foreign background had a percentage of 44%.
was 7 percent
However, other political parties of Germany for example, SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei,were against this proposal that while collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired which German citizens have foreign backgrounds.
We want quick evacuation of troops from Gaza: Olmert

On the other side, Palestinian President Mahmood Abbas has insisted on the formation of national government in the areas of Palestine.
A video message for Germany from Al-Qaeda
In this 30 minute video message, a man wearing a black turban with a covered face and holding a gun is giving a message to the German Government.
This man introduces himself as Abu Talha and speaks in German.
There are also Arabic sub-titles on the video message.
on the side of the screen is the logo of Al-Qaida and the date written in the video is October 2008.
in this message it is said to the German government that after deploying such a large number of troops in Afghanistan this country is thinking that it will not be attacked.
introducing himself as Abu Talha, this man however did not threaten to directly attack Germany.
the number of German troops amongst the Allied NATO forces in Afghanistan is around 3500.
last year the German parliament approved a bill to send one thousand more troops to Afghanistan.
this is the first message to Germany from Al-Qaida.
having a critical eye on terrorism related issues, the famous expert Mikhail Luders says regarding this message: "The recent suicide attack on the German embassy in Kabul is proof of the fact that we should take it seriously in any case."
for the past few years Al-Qaida has been issuing video messages on the internet after which there were attacks.
On Saturday, the militant organization called the Taliban took responsibility for the suicide attacks that took place outside the German embassy.
Many German newspapers and thinkers are looking at this attack in connection with the Al-Qaeda message.
"They are targeting Germany."
Fundamentalist Muslims are viewing Germany's Afghan policy in a negative and critical manner.
They accuse the German government of following an extremist policy not only in Afghanistan, but also in the Middle East.
Because of this, they are increasingly considering Germany as their target.
In the meantime, the German government claims that the German secret agencies knew about this video before it became public.
The German joint crime control organization is busy studying the video.
Obama has been elected to the American Presidency.
In this situation the whole world - to say nothing of the American public - has different hopes for Obama.
Now that Barack Obama is receiving congratulatory messages from around the world after winning the presidency, expectations of him are also becoming clear.
The German Chancellor, Angela Merchel, also expressed hopes for the new American president.
"I believe that the Joint Republic of Germany and the United States of America will be able to get together on the basis of a strong relationship and partnership to solve the problems facing us."
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said that Obama seems like a serious and open-hearted person, qualities he felt were positive.
As such, the previous American president's policies were subject to criticism.
However, the previous administration is definitely credited with persuading China to play a more constructive role on the international level. With regards to the new president, China's leader has said that he will have to work for strong military ties between the countries.
Gosuwe Hu, an expert on Chinese politics active in Bokhum, Germany, says:
From this viewpoint, I am certain that Obama and his economic team will, within the coming weeks and months, pressure the Beijing government into pegging the Chinese currency at a stable and market-representing exchange rate.
The previous American administration also increased ties with India.
About where Obama might take those ties, Professor Christopher Raj, expert on American sciences in New Delhi, says that we are now closer to a strategic partnership, but Obama cannot make any changes overnight.
In his message to Obama, Pope Benedict has stressed peace and co-operation in the world.

The retreat of Israeli soldiers from Ajleen province of Gaza didn't match the forbearance of Palestinian soldiers.
According to the Urdu service of Mehr news agency, even on the 16th day of the fight between truth and falsehood in Gaza, there was beastly bombing by the Israel on the city population  of Gaza by the use of air, land and naval attacks.  Because of these attacks, 880 people have died so far.

They always ready to die.  Mujahids of Ajeen province have defeated the Israeli army, with the power of faith and martyrdom, and a show of amazing forbearance and steadfastness, tightening the collar of life, around the necks of the Zionist enemies.
If it were not for the deception of the Egyptian president, Hasani Mubarak, the brave and loyal Hamas Mujahids would have defeated Israel a long time ago.  But apart from the Israeli siege, the Egyptians have also placed Palestinian Muslims under siege, which is the saddest story of Arab history.
Here, the Saudi Arabian and Jordanian governments are giving the Israeli government political and economic support.  They are helping Israel by deceiving the helpless Muslims of Gaza.

Barack Obama said that Iran would be a very big challenge for the American government.

President George Bush, unable and disliked president Bush accepted his mistakes and crimes in his last press statement.
Mehr News Agency related from Associated Press that the American president George Bush, in the last press conference of his term, accepted many of his mistakes and crimes.
Speaking during the press conference at the White House, President Bush said that though newly elected president Obama has good intentions, the biggest challenge facing him would be preventing possible attacks on America.
He said that the completion of the Iraq mission and social security reforms were his mistakes.
President Bush said that whatever he did, he did it for the sake of protecting America.
Upon being asked various questions about the Israeli inflictions on Gaza, President Bush said that Israel has the right to defend itself. According to him, Hamas does not have the right to defend itself and Hamas should not do anything to Israel, and like America, the whole world should choke the oppressed rather than the oppressor.
The incapable and despicable president of the United States said that Hamas should not be given weapons either, while America is providing Israel the world's most destructive weapons. Israel is using American weapons to massacre Palestinians and Bush also praised the Israel-supporting Arabs, calling them the friends of Israel.
Bush expressed shame at some of the crimes going on in the Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo prisons.
People are opining that cases should be filed against Bush for his war crimes, and that the organizations which manage to do this will have done a great service to humanity.
Iranian President Ahmedinejad expressed sorrow over the silence of the Arab leaders.
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, the Iranian President Mahmood Ahmadinejad criticized the Arab leaders' silence on the Israeli inhumanity and oppression on Gaza, expressing his sorrow.
President Ahmadinejad said, expressing surprise over the Arab countries and their leaders' silence over the beastly acts of Israel, that Israel is subjecting the Palestinian public to a holocaust. They are making the Palestinian children, women and civilians targets of their barbarianism, and the Arab leaders have not even given one statement.
President Ahmede Nejad has called upon all the Arab countries to unite against Israel and to save the oppressed Muslims of Gaza from Israel's harm and tyranny.
Ahmade Nejad says the Saudi King should clarify his stance on the  genocide being done in Gaza by Israel.
According to the report by MAHAR/MEHR news agency, President Ahmede Nejad in his message to the Saudi King Malik Abdullah declared that the silence on the human genocide in Gaza and muteness on the murder of innocent children and women by  the Muslim King of Saudi Arabia is encouraging the enemies of Islam.
President Ahmede Nejad has said in his message: "You should show your true stance on Gaza and declare support for the oppressed, so that the enemy's efforts to plant differences in the Islamic block will fail."
President Ahmede Nejad has said in his message: "You know that for the last 19 days Israel has been bent upon human genocide, murdering innocent children, and subjecting homes, mosques, schools and hospitals to barbaric bombing. The Zonist Regime is brutally murdering the unarmed Muslims in Gaza. In situations like these, silence on the part of leaders like you is only encouraging Israel."
President Ahmede Nejad has told Malik Abdullah that even non-Muslim countries like Valenzuela and Bolivia have taken concrete steps against Israel and that he is expected to take better steps.
President Ahmede Nejad told the Palestinians that success will be at their feet in Gaza.
He says that the oppressed will win over the oppressors because that's Allah's promise.
President George Bush: Terrorism is Still a Threat to USA
MEHER/MAHAR news agency has copied from the German news agency that the US President, while addressing his successor Barak Obama and the nation in his farewell speech, said that though the US is safer than it was seven years ago, the threat of terrorism still looms over USA.
Bush said that because enemy terrorists are waiting patiently to attack America and have a strong determination to do so, America should never be unaware about its security.
The American president ignored the pain and suffering of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza and defended his policies, saying that America is still the biggest supporter of Gaza's independence. However, commentators do not accept the reality of the unpopular president's remarks, as America is neither a supporter of freedom, nor a supporter of human rights, but rather is the most mischievous country in the world. Not only does it support a blood thirsty country like Israel, but it is also directly involved in its crimes.
The Israelis openly kill woman, children and other civilians. Despite this, the American president is congratulating them. This is the American humanity and freedom which the world is seeing in Gaza and other places.
Usama Hamdan: Presence of army in Palestine continues
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, Usamah Hamdan,  the Hamas leader in Lebanon, told French News Agency during an interview that a one-sided ceasefire from the Israeli side is against the comprehensive international efforts for a ceasefire. He said that as long as Israel is present in Gaza, a one-sided ceasefire is meaningless.
Hamadan said that the one sided ceasefire was an unsuccessful effort of Israel to escape defeat. He said that if Israel wants long term peace, it will have to accept Hamas's conditions as well as end this siege.
He made it clear that if Israel tries a one-sided ceasefire with its army remaining in the Gaza belt, there will be resistance.
Addressing a one-way conference from Beirut, Usamah Hamdan called for European nations to break ties with Israel.
The Hamas leader said that the increasing numbers of the martyred and injured will only increase our determination.
He also told the Palestinian public to stay firmly rooted and resist the enemy like a boulder.

Apart from this, the White House is expected to revise suspected terrorism investigation methods and ban ill treatment of prisoners during interrogation.
President Barack Obama started to fulfill his election campaign promises from his first day in office, and first of all started by taking steps toward making the actions and workings of the government transparent.
Experts say that the American president has started making efforts to save the declining image of America throughout the world, but that would be difficult, because as long as it will keep supporting the blood thirsty Israeli government, it can not be expected to do anything good. Therefore if America wants to save its image, it will have to stop its support of Israel and have to disassociate itself from Israel's crimes.
Tony Blair stresses the need to include Islamic organization Hamas in the talks.
Mehr news agency quoted from British newspaper The Times that former Prime Minister Tony Blair stressed the need to include Hamas in the talks to bring about peace in the Middle East.
According to the newspaper, Tony Blair said that it is important that a path be found for bringing Hamas into the Middle East peace process. Blair criticized the Bush administration for speaking only to Mahmood Abbas and ignoring Hamas. It should be clear that the western countries have realized the democratic and organizational powers of Hamas and are calling for bringing them into the talks, whereas previously they used to consider it a terrorist organization. A terrorist organization which is trying to defend its country and struggling to save its own house from the clutches of others. Whose house and country have been in the hand of the occupying Israeli government for 60 years.

In southern Afghanistan, voter registration had to be started this week for the upcoming presidential election.
The commission has stated that voters in a few areas of the province Hilmand will not be able to get registered unless the security situation improves.
In those parts of the south, conflict has increased from last year, where rebel Taliban members have increased attacks on Afghan and international forces.
Meanwhile, Afghan and international forces have said that overnight from Wednesday into Thursday, they have killed at least 28 militants in battles across Afghanistan.
NATO claimed that its military forces killed 22 enemy soldiers in land and air strikes in the Western province of Khost, near the Pakistani border.
Previously, the Afghan Defense Ministry had claimed that the Afghan army had killed eight rebels and injured two within the province.

Despite the military activity going on in Swat during the last one and a half years, about 150 educational institutions were destroyed by the militants by the use of explosives and arson.
Due to the destruction of these educational institutions, thousands of girls and boys were deprived of an education.

Tea may help prevent breast cancer
According to new research, drinking three cups of tea every day
the risk for breast cancer is reduced by more than one third  in women under 50 years old.
Research conducted by the MOFT center in Florida, USA, has found that women under 50 years age that have breast cancer genes
The risk of breast cancer is reduced by 37 percent in women who drink three cups of tea per day.
The research shows that women over 50 years of age do not see any benefit from drinking three or more cups of tea a day.
The researchers think that for women under 50, the tea contains elements that are effective against the genes that cause breast cancer.
Research was done on 5000 women who had Breast Cancer treatment at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa,Florida.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
Specialists compared their medical records and lifestyles to those women who were free of breast cancer.
Specialists also found that tea had the most effect on one specific kind of breast cancer, Lobes.  It reduced the risk by 66%.
One on every ten breast cancer patients has this kind of cancer.
This type of breast cancer is dangerous because it is deep inside and usually only diagnosed when it has become widespread.
Specialists found that having at least three cups of tea every day can readily reduce the chances of breast cancer in women of younger ages.
They found that incorporating tea as a regular drink in your daily routine helps create immunity against the cancer.
Almost 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in Britain.
According to Gates, the war in Afghanistan is the greatest military challenge facing America

Gates told the Senate Armed Services committee that fighting is not the only solution to the Afghanistan issue. But he added that in order to secure several areas, sufficient numbers of troops are not deployed, and the Taliban take advantage of that to continue their operations.
Why Reduce Exercise With Age?
New Research
Exercise at any age is good for your health.
It energizes your heart, reduces cholesterol levels, helps in keeping weight low, helps to prevent diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer's or dementia.
Unfortunately the ability to exercise decreases for many people as they age.
Experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active however age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise from not doing exercise.
Dr. Pattricia P. Leka of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says that increase in age is a big reason for being handicapped from exercise and other physical activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo clinic.
She headed a research study regarding heart disease and man's ability to do exercise in older age.
A team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart
in which it's activity of pumping blood and its contraction and relaxation was studied.
Researcher focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.
They came to know ,that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.
Dr. Patricia says with increase in age, problems occur in the activity of relaxation of heart and this effects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garvin Ken was also part of this research.
He says that they were surprised to see that it has an effect  and it confirmed that bad exercising ability is very much related to the heart relaxing activity.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause disorders in heart functions and heart disease.
If the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard, the patient can take advantage of the benefits of exercise regardless of age.
A detailed report on this matter is published in a magazine from the American Medical Association.
No Chances of an Immediate War with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief
Indian Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan. "However/ we are always ready to defend our country and sacrifice our lives for it," he said.
He has stated that even with commitments from other nations and international pressure on Pakistan as a result of Mumbai attacks, the infrastructure of terrorism is not only existent but also proactive in Pakistan.
He said this while talking to correspondents in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day tour to the valley of Kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in New Delhi-administered Kashmir and preparation of armed forces on the borders.
He was asked his thoughts on media reports that Pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from India regarding the Mumbai attacks.
General Kapoor said that the decisions of peace or war matters are made by the political leadership.
Talking about terrorism in the land of Pakistan, he allegedly said that India will fight against the forces that are trying to destroy peace and weaken India.
He said that there are around 700 to 800 fighters present in Indian Kashmir, of whom almost 50% are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that the governmental efforts of encroachment between Pakistan and Kashmir would be increased only when the weather improved, although India has increased security on the boarders.
They have refused the possibility of reducing the number of army soldiers in Indian Kashmir by stating that one can not compromise over the country's security.
May God answer the world's prayers that Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, we shall see if the relationship between America and Pakistan is affected in our favor by this change.
What will Mr. Barrack Obama give to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams?
Obama - whose middle name is Hussein - becoming president of America is historically important in many ways, and is also a great challenge.
Not only for himself but also for those who supported him with all their hearts.
It will also be challenging be for the white majority as it is not easy for them to accept that a colored man is ruling over them.
Here in South Asia, Muslims who have expectations from him, should remember that he has been elected as the President of the United States. And Obama should remember that being President of the United States actually means being the President of the entire world.
A man whose brothers and sisters were brought to America as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, this will be a win for the people who love him.
What will be its effect on South Asia, and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan?
?
Whether it is by Obama or some one else, the policy of the entire world is done by Jews who lobby billionaires and influence powerful and effective people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts, the offensive reactions of India, America and Israel are in front of everyone.
Even for a while, after Pakistan was formed, the managing of Swat was left to the Ruler of Swat, which had its own army and law.
They surrendered their rule to the government of Pakistan according to a treaty.
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a stepmother.
There has been no increase in the number of schools in Swat, since the rule of the Ruler of Swat was finished.
Nor was there any interest in construction and development over there.
The number of girls receiving education in the present rule is many times less than their number in the previous rule.
In the Sarhad state of Pakistan, the local Taliban have been targeting the educational institutions.
The most schools were destroyed in Swat province, of which the majority were girls' schools.
Not only this, but the Taliban have announced the prohibition of girls' education in Swat.
Thousands of male and female students are being deprived of education.
What do you think the Taliban have to gain by eradicating the education of women?
Why has the government been unsuccessful in stopping these illegal steps?
What do you think the government should do?
The question should be, what do the ISI and Pakistani agencies get?
The public of Swat must have realized that this was a game and that the army was there to serve the Taliban, rather than to kill them. Otherwise, how could five schools have been blown up in a single curfew night? How could people have been slaughtered during curfew and hung in the main circle of the town?
When the government is not allowed to have any say in Swat, how can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps?
Now, the question arises as to why these four Taliban are not being controlled when the government has an armed military, new and dangerous weapons, a new spy system, and more.
The answer to this is that they have the hand of a hidden guide on their heads, because of which neither do their weapons get exhausted, nor do they get captured.
The conclusion is that the Taliban, via their dark activities, is making the work of the global leadership easier.
15 years ago, there was war in Afghanistan.
ISI used to control the Taliban when there was the opposition from the Northern Alliance, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then, suddenly, the situation changed and the Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of money from America, so the former friend became an enemy.
Now the situation has changed, but the war is still going on and those supporting them in Pakistan are still Russia, India and Iran.
Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.
For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play God with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings
The question is whether war, armed resistance and terrorism are the solutions to the problem?
If not, then what is the magic recipe that will bring about a solution to the problem?
It is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but rather give 'blessings' to them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development that Nelson Mandela used in South Africa.
That is: to struggle character wise and politically more than with arms.
Seeing the Kashmiris taking part in the elections, it looks as if they have accepted this view point.
It is the third week of Israeli attacks on Gaza, and the number of deaths have come close to a thousand.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date a ceasefire has not been possible.
According to another report, since the start of attacks on the 27th of December, 90,000 Palestinians have left their homes and moved towards safer locations.
Here aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, and said that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victims of grave psychological and emotional difficulties.
What do you say?
What should happen?
How is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Give Taliban a Chance.
Basit, Peshawar.
Wake up! If the Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down girl's schools?
And kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
The Taliban has damaged Islam in such a way that no other nation or religion has done.
Pashtoon Rore
Kohat, Pakistan
If the whole Muslim world just gave a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see how upset will father America will be.
And immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well.
But what can be done? Where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from?
Someone tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step, as he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
The responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on Arab and the Muslim worlds but its the obligation of the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny.
This unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
Just like in Pakistan and India before 30th June or the end of the fiscal year, the government institutions are looted, the American regime just before its end have given a green signal to Israel to do what ever it wants.
On one hand America says that effort will be made for ceasefire.
On the other hand, the United Nations is passing resolution after resolution, but action-wise, has done nothing. There is only one meaning of this, and that is that the even the United Nations is openly in favor of destroying the Muslims.
All Muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the United Nations, and should establish their own global organization.
We have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations are seen, but the harm is only done to the Muslims.
What is the use of these vain efforts if BBC does not want to publish anything?
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically of Muslims, is spilled, the monster of unbiasedness gets onto BBC's back.
It considers itself the standard bearer of truth.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments from Muslims.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments from Muslims.
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, and the likes of you stay among Muslims, and call yourselves Muslims.
[syja786]
A recent trend in BBC forums has been the subject of terrorism of India, and the subject sometimes arises while discussing suicide attacks.
These anti-Islamic comments often use the term extremism.
But the real extremist is the person who made the above comment.
When will Muslims understand that Dajjal can not be fought with the sword?
Looking at the helpless people facing the Israel bombings, if the heart does not cry, what does it do?
The most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that using the name of Jihad disfigures the beautiful face of Islam.
When a majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existence of Israel, what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks?
The conduct of both sides is misanthropic.
The action of the United Nations and the United States seem to support the wrongdoings of Israel.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
The real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism. After all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, is this large scale terrorism possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who these controller are.
So this situation, in common terms, is called DADAGEERI, which means do what ever you can.
It hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry.
Medicine for the injured and coffins for the dead are being supplied by the Arab leaders and in case
the Israeli attacks should take place.
This is the actual problem. The leaders of Muslim countries, including the Saudi crown prince are in a false sleep. They have an neither an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
They should take immediate measures against Israel.
For example, stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Salam to All brothers and sisters!
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is the same as them declaring defeat.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature.  The steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer, growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants don't realize.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Israel and Hamas should enter a truce so that the death and destruction can come to an end.
Mohammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France
Absolutely correctly stated.
Suppose that Hamas is 100% truthful, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah.  Even then, they should know that if a good deed results in the destruction of an established house, it is no longer a good deed.
For those who claim to love God, love the messenger, and love their religion, loving mankind is a part of their faith.
As if it is the order of Allah to wipe all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than Muslims.
Najeeb-ur-Rahman Psycho *Lahore* [Pakian]
No! It is not decreed to annihilate, but it is decreed to invite people to Islam.
People who have conspiracies against the religion are decreed to do Jihad against them.
One should fight with them until they finish their conspiracies, but this certainly does not mean that they can wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the consequence of a murder of children is disaster.
It's a request to my friends that yesterday Israelis did not have a roof over their heads and today they are so strong that they do not listen to anyone because all Jews are one.
They do not have Shiite nor Sunni, all are just Jews, and they have succeeded in every field and made everything.
Opposite to this, what is the condition of 55 Islamic Countries?
By lagging in every field now the condition is that they are so helpless that enemies are killing them and they are waiting for their death.
The point is that all Muslim countries should get together and should make a plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
and there is no better strategy, that recognize Israel, learn modern education and means of progress and let the world live in peace and harmony.
The Muslims have plenty of land and means as well.
the need is of proper use.
The first and most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque.  This was impossible without getting Yasin and Arafat out of the way.
The world is witnessing that Palestine had been scattered after the death of these two leaders.
and how the Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
In 1974 a Pakistani Prime Minister was so trusted worldwide that for the first time in history he manged to gather all the Muslim leaders under one roof with hundred percent attendance.
Today on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task for the whole nation to promise to keep unity in its lines.
While eradicating the differences between other Muslims, the formation of an Islamic common wealth will be carried forward.
It is a monster that has gripped Palestine for half a century.
This monster has many faces.
Many times, this monster criticizes itself from its own different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
Its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This monster is most unhappy with Islam, because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out it will be through Islam. Muslims and the perfect religion of practical Islam, have put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
Bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since the 27th of December.
More than three hundred Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
After the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
Through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
However, the Israeli authorities say they will continue operation in Gaza until they make sure the rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
In your opinion, is this claim by Israel true?  Is Israel  doing all this to defend its own sovereignty?
Is the world community doing enough in this situation?
Does this aggression have any relation to the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can any improvement be expected in the situation in the middle east after the newly elected American president Barak Obama takes office?

The BBC makes it a point to dig out and publish such accounts.
After all, they have to maintain the illusion of neutrality.
By the way, BBC news is factual, but an essential factor is the tone in which the news is delivered.
Which news to be made prominent and which news to be considered as insignificant.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
Now even the electronic media and printed media of Pakistan, specifically a few Urdu newspapers and columnists, are not behind anybody else in exhibiting this skill-- who, while giving coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism, and while writing about it, hide facts about the grudge mafia.
It has been said that the United Nations seemingly supports human rights and peace but actually the Muslims are being subjected to extreme levels of cruelty and brutality. And what we hear from the United Nations is that Hamas should stop the attacks. How long will this hypocrisy carry on?
Why there is so much atrocity committed on Muslims. If people like Americans are backing up the Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So, Americans, if you have courage then stop supporting them and see then what their fate is.
So-called writers and murderers in name of peace should understand that peace in the world can only be obtained through justice not through genocide.
If any nations perish through genocide and results of choice can be obtained then after actions of Hitler, existence of Jews and their uprising was impossible.
As poet says.
Atrocity is atrocity, it vanishes when it rises.
Blood is blood, clots when drop.
Now who will tell whom what is terrorism?
Is this comes in terrorism, why? because own pain is only felt.
Other people are not humans or blood of Muslims is so cheap or color of these innocents' blood was not red?
And now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere?
I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.
I can not find the words that are strong enough to condemn the actions that resulted in the dead bodies on the road, and the helpless, injured, and innocent faces soaked in blood.
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims in this situation.  On the one hand, because of the killing in India the rest of the world comes over to Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations that we would normally do on our own.
On the other hand, Israel is killing generations of muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent.  This is unbearable!
There is delay but NEVER in the house of God and only then will this darkness be shed. Then
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Elections are important for securing the people's support, especially in countries like Israel, and rulers should continue to hold them.  However, history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy so Barrack Obama likely won't either.  Regime, whether black or white, is still a regime.
From the debates in the forum it is evident that everyone is sad about Benazir's death, however we can not ignore her political mistakes.
There's room for debate about whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was so dear then why did it take American involvement to end Musharaf's ten year dictatorship?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the public needed her. Unfortunately, she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised.
When each and every historic personality is being accused, there is no one to say anything about this.

How brutal is our nation?  Not only we are blind while writing odes on ourselves and our parties, but now we are picking, accusing and criticizing every historical scholar and no body is there to say any thing about it.
Enough of development that we have made.
Sana Khan
Few things are ignored just by thinking that nothing can be done with them. Just like a donkey can not become a scholar by just loading books onto it.
Because of the Mumbai attacks, there has been a setback in the dialog between Pakistan and India.  However, Pakistan and India should continue these dialogs.
If we talk of war then it will bring loss of life on both sides.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu.  On the other hand, when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer.  Shortly afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader; point to be noted.
First of all Merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and to all the Christian brothers of the forum.
Greeting to all friends of the Forum: Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida and Mr. Akram.
We do not want the flames of fire; but the flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
Will war give a solution to our problems?
It will be blessed with fire and blood.
It will give hunger and exigence.
Therefore wise humans
It's better to avoid war.
In our yard.
It's better that the glim keeps lightened
The India-America relations have deepened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
This is the history of America.
In the case of an Indian attack, America's goals will be fulfilled, and the expenses will be India's.
Pakistan should clearly announce that it will not start a conflict, but if a conflict is caused, there will be no talks of peace or truce. The war will not stop until India is completely destroyed or captured, even if it involves our own destruction.
This is Islamic history.
Before the resolution, the message that had to be given by the public and the army was released.
In compensation for the Mumbai attacks, the abnormal diplomatic and military benefits that India tried to gain, made it more a victimizing party, than a victim. That is why, in contrast to the harsh initial global reactions, the world has now reduced their force on Pakistan.
The satisfaction expressed by the United Nations over Pakistani efforts and the praise by the Interpol leader of Pakistani efforts, in disregard of India's commotion, shows the side effect of India's more than necessary diplomacy.
There is no argument about the brutality of these actions.
But the question is, when thousands of Taliban were attacking Pir Samiullah's town, where were the Pakistani Army, and what were they doing?
Should the army not be taken into account, for what they did there in a year?
How many Taliban die each day due to their firing of thousands of mortar and canon shells?
I appeal to the ICI that they stop their guardianship of the Taliban, for God's sake, and let us live peacefully in paradise like Swat,
and that they stop this fixed operation.
The day is not far when a resolution will be passed in the United Nations against army intervention in Pakistan, the same way as it was passed against Jama'athud-Da'wah.
Riyaz Ahmad Farooqi
First of all, our radicalism and our protecting them, is alone, sufficient to provide complete proof and permissibility for action against us. And the very day such a resolution is passed, there is all probability that no voice will be raised in our support, in the United Nations.
And supposing the passing of such a resolution is delayed, some other strength will definitely leave our aid to ourself,, keeping the example of America in front of them.
We do not know about the personality and works of Pir Samiullah.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
The bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah, and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are eternal even after death.
But here an international game is being played. Here ferocity and animosity are created to do the ruling.
So there can be reason created that if we are not here then these vandals and animals can come take over the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so-called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
America sees the torture of these extremists but instead of being sad about these faithless activities, they easily call them "tribal culture".
The reason for these faithless activities, sometimes given in the name of tribal culture and other times in the name of Islam, is not something done by a person with a heart.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so brave that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also men of God and so is our army.
It is very clear that there is something fishy.
Instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and lesson-gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen. Besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "What Will Happen After Death" also create fear and terror.
These people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of obtaining world power.
Wiso!
You have scared the world with the fire of hell.
You, yourself, have become the reason for fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Who burned the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on the refusal of the oath after the Prophet passed away and who took her husband by the rope around his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
Was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
Motives cannot be diminished and correcion cannot be made without accepting reality.
O' BBC please stop this dual-headed policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
A human was pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office?  Please show some modesty.
the success of Operation Sherdil and Operation Lion Heart across the border depends on who is in the favor of public opinion.
This is an act of American and Pakistani agencies and Peer.  Sahab is a victim of this conspiracy.
Now that secret agens have successfully joined the Taliban and they are doign what the can to change public opinion, all discussions on this forum will now be anti Taliban.
I only want to ask, when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public? They even report something like this: "Bombing of Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother".
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000 in Swat went there to do.
The bodies of the Taliban who help the army are left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake, stop this drama.
These Taliban members have tarnished the Muslim image.
If, around the world, true Muslims don't call these terrorists Muslims, then why are these elements able to live in the lands of true Muslims?
Those who become shameless can't do hard labor, and they pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
No religion or family tradition allows this.
All the media, incl present their views on the Taliban or the tribal people in different styles.
No one, other than us tribal people, are aware of the ground realities, what the truth is, and what really is the matter.
In short, it's a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a Talib or a tribal. Warmongers, who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions, made these institutions.
This move has ashamed all Muslims.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is the Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq, a man who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that the current leadership will end this  cancer.
After the Mumbai attacks, India said that extremists are behind the attacks.
Pakistan rejected the accusations and said that it will help India in investigating the attacks in every possible way.
India said that it has given a list to Pakistan that has 20 suspected extremists being sought by India.
Now Pakistan has said that included in the list is Jaish-e-Muhammad's Molana Azhar Masood, who is not in custody and the government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before that, Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari refuted the view that the West's secret agencies and the Indian government had given evidence related to the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari has said that it has not been proven that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani.
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that its relations with India are not going to improve until its land is ceased to be used for terrorism.
In latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should sports be effected due to recent political events?
What future to you see for India-Pakistan relations?
Neither America nor India broke Pakistan.
Pakistan was broken by the Pakistanis themselves.
What else could be expected after such regionalism, communalism and vandalism.
Even Jinnah did not do good for the Muslims of India. Time has proved this.
Yasmin, Chicago
If we had kept working on the vision of Jinnah, destroying the cancer of communalism, then regionalism and vandalism would not have spread in Pakistan, and the Muslims of India would not have been treated poorly.
It's our fault that we could not bring up a leader of his stature.
If we can not care for our heroes, then
this region has great capabilities.
God knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
In both countries, enemies of peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv sena, RSS have been raised.
The evil powers don't want this region to progress, therefore these countries are controlled like puppets.
Can you imagine what status this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world?
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
May Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
But sir, open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and reality on the ground, and you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
Moreover, the internal affairs don't seem to be good, as you can see the circumstances in NWFP, Balochistan and in Karachi in Sindh.
In this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
O Allah bestow your mercy upon us.
According to my understanding, a final war is inevitable.
This is enough of it.
Now it should be do or die.
This problem cannot be solved through these acts of insincere dialogues.
And not through small scale terrorism in each other's country.
After all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
And if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all of our political parties agree on this matter that these terrorist and denominational activities should be terminated from the country.
But our army rule does not seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, American and Europe are made to believe that we are with you on this war against terrorism and the other hand, we also help Taliban secretly.
We have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way. Thank you.
There is no doubt in this that majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are the members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined  the party  named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.
Although these members preferred subsidiary activities and now after India's great persistence, The United Nation has invalidated it also and Government of Pakistan is continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it is better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
Terrorist groups present in Pakistan, who support professional criminals and the heads of those Mullahs are those who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.
And now they are doing everything to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan from these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to wonder whether we should ban these mutinous people or not?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose work is only to kill.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What kind of world is this where it is hard to live for one who takes the name of one major pillar of Islam,  religion of Allah.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims but when Muslims even try to take revenge, all our hypocrite leaders together with all the non-Muslim world treat people with the true and right pain of religion just like our great leader Hafiz Saeed is being treated today.
India in impunity of Bombay attacks.
Pakistan relations are bitter. The better relationship as a result of last few years between the two countries have been jolted greatly.
India has always held the military and non-military groups in Pakistan responsible.
And putting the relationship back on track is being conditioned by operations against these groups.
Indian security departments have held Lashkher-e-Tayyaba responsible for the Bombay attacks.
In this case, the name of Jamat-ud-Dawa has come to the forefront many times.
This is the first time that relationship between both the countries has worsened due to terrorist activity in India.
In December 2001, after the attacks on the Indian Parliament, these two neighbors were on the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
Now it is about Jamat-ud-Dawa, which Security analysts say that is in reality a new face of Lashker-e-Tayyaba. Restrictions on the party are being requested.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan conduct decisive operations against extreme activists on its land?
By banning Jamat-ud-Dawa, can  the current Pak-India crisis be brought to a close?
And how important is it to close down the armed groups to keep constant peace between both countries?
The Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all, what proof does the Security Council have to decide this so quickly?
Does the Security Council always show urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful country.
Whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours? India. And they want to put the blame for it's inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis, continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salam: Please do it with pleasure but act on your own.
Do not do it under American pressure.
If India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
And why does it accuse us of everything?
There are extremist groups and organizations in India as well. Why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the world?
What India is doing in Kashmir, what is that?
What Israel is doing, what is that?
The truth is, we are the first nuclear Muslim state. Why is this the main issue?
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart.
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be part of this conspiracy.
American are not slowly but now very swiftly tightening their grip on Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances, if we as a nation dos not display unity and solidarity, then if Bangladesh can be created, anything can happen.
Terrorism is condemned, whether it is in a hotel in Mumbai or in a Marriott Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine.
Likewise, regardless of the origin of the terrorists, they should be eliminated, whether they are Pakistani or Indian or American or Israeli.
Now the question is that why the whole world, including Pakistani officials, are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack carried out on the Marriott Hotel not a terrorist attack?
Then why?
Hale to the adviser for interior Rehman Malik, how brave and bold the gentleman has become.
No image.
Not only this; but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity. That the arresting of the terrorists has been carried out under "someone's pressure".
Wow, praise to the Almighty!
Whether having the ability to say that I don't want to or not.
We, the Pakistanis, are fighting whose war?
We have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect.
No one has a right to interfere with anyone's national affairs.
The colonial system is apparently not there.
If people expect justice, demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan. I do not believe this is acceptable by those calling for unity.
As such, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
And this causes more feelings of opposition.
If they trust America and the United republics, then let them leave the style of new populations, and let them work on those lines, upholding the sovereignty of the state.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
In Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, security forces captured a proved camp of practically non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India's accusation is that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice told the Pakistani leadership that there should be immediate action taken against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack.
It is their claim that without a doubt, the extremists who carried out the Mumbai attacks used Pakistani land.
Meanwhile, officials in Peshawar claim that the lot of trucks which carry supplies to the united forces in Afghanistan was burned by unidentified armed people, because of which more than 50 trucks were destroyed.
This is the second attack in Peshawar on NATO and American supplies in the last 48 hours.
Meanwhile, Pakistan captured an established camp of the almost non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba. Previously, lots of efforts were carried out to try to disarm groups all the way from Karachi to the tribal regions, which included giving compensation to those who returned their weapons and even assuring them that no action would be taken against them.
The situation is telling us that the efforts undertaken in the regime of General Ziyaul Haqq, after the previous Soviet Union's interference in Afghanistan to get rid of the armed groups that formed as a result of the resistance that started through American and Saudi funding, and to bring an environment similar to that before 1980 were not successful.
The question is what does Pakistan want to do?
Does Pakistan have the ability to do so?
What do you say?

I have only one question for the standard bearers of the world.
If you kill their children, will they come to give you garlands? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill innocent people, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in negative, then you really need to fix your viewpoint.
The people were armed when there was the fear that Russia would head towards Pakistan after finishing Afghanistan, and that is why they were supplied with arms.
Now, when there is the fear that America will capture Pakistan, via Afghanistan, as the present American president has clearly mentioned in his presidential mission, why should we disarm them now?
Only such that after defeating the American or Indian army it does not have to face any resistance from the public?
Yes, if any of them are guilty of being involved in any destructive work, Pakistan can take action against them alone.
It is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved, proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it's still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
Another question is that were these terrorists supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or trained in Pakistan, and not any other country in the world?
As for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the present terrorism is in no way connected to it.
It must be remembered that Hafiz Saeed is the first 'Jehadi leader' who called the Taliban actions 'mischief'.
I'm sure that the Taliban effect is a inseparable result of American plans, and hence every person who can stand in the way of the Taliban must be removed.
Despite the support of the whole nation, the fact that Zardari and co. took action against the Lashkar is a clear sign of their frigid and kiss-up nature.
To stop the project that is running on Saudi-American funding, they must be requested themselves to regather the filth that has polluted our society.
America and Saudi spread in our country dangerous weapons and so-called "Jihadi", which is in reality hate-inciting and cultural virus enticing literature. Our country has become a human slaughterhouse because of this.
Due to the risk of attack from India, The Pakistani Army's announcement that it would remove forces from the Afghan border and post them at the Indian border, and the Taliban's announcement that it would handle the Afghan border caused America to stumble and pressure India not to attack Pakistan.
This showed the strength of America in the region.
Though India did not warn that they would attack, nor do they have that much courage.
The Taliban attacked and finished most of the remaining American supplies.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and tha Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi is the trade and financial center of Pakistan, and the Dubai of the backward regions.
Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty handed, but ever since the law and order situation in the western border regions was lost, all people diverted their attention here.
Now they want to kidnap this city.
Pathans are now called Pukhtons, made foreigners, and forced to fight, while the need in Pakistan is for unity.
One solution to the problem is to have the Urdu speak or learn Pushto or the Pushto to speak or learn Urdu. Alternatively, it would be best for everybody to learn English.
You must be thinking its a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
The cause of the torture is language.
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir in my childhood I had actually given the same suggestion many times to my friends ,which included people from every religion and rhetoric groups, but people used to laugh over these suggestions.
At that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not that evident but they were boiling up inside.
It is hard to understand what is happening and why.
Are these the signs of judgement day?
What are these innocent and innoxious people being killed for?
The reason is in front of everyone; there are those who want to break Pakistan into pieces and those who do all this neither belong to this religion nor this country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns
Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir mean that is what is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
At the height of the Mumbai attacks, efforts to cause mischief on linguistic and racial lines in Karachi failed, which is proof that those politicians working on racial parole have resigned from their jobs.
The taking of the lives of innocent Pushtu speaking laborers, and the Indian warnings have awakened the sleeping Pakistani feelings from Karachi to Khyber.
The identical country loving reaction of all the political, religious, linguistic and national parties has not only taught India the manners of diplomacy, but it has also given the American policy makers a chance to think again.
The responsible parties for the worsening situation in Karachi are the United and the ANP. The government is taking sides.
The government can control the situation in one hour, but it is purposely allowing it to grow.
The police and rangers are avoiding action because of the pressure on them by the political parties.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
Until pressure is put on the administration, these kinds of incidents will keep taking place.
I think these people are terrorists.
Foreign powers are definitely involved in this, but no one knows who they are.
If these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there?  Because it's not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
The government should operate here and save a large and very important city from terrorism.
otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
BBC Urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure, and Pakistani media's condition is already weak.
The whole truth is on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that either Urdu speakers should learn Pushto, or Pushto speaking learn Urdu, or better if every body learns English.
You will definitely take this as a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
The reason for persecution may be language.
Another story of murder has finally been published in Karachi, which was being dreaded by all the citizens for a long time.
The criminals do not let go any opputunity of a crime. The news reports and the media are only telling 50% of what actually happened here in 4 days.
We have spent the last three nights without sleeping and the fear is still there.
Those who make the people evacuate hotels, those who kill the shoe-makers and the peanut-sellers.
Those who rob and kill at the Super Highway, and cut off the ears of innocent citizens, they are ignorant of the wrath of Allah which will eventually entrap them.
What could be the reasons of this sudden turmoil in your opinion?
(B.B.C)
Keeping in view, the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai, we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in Karachi. It is simple and easy to guess that the turmoil is just due to an unconcious trade of blood.
Obviously if somebody infuriates a father, it would not be surprising if the son reacts violently.
The blood of the loyalists of Liaqat Ali Khan also belonged to the same place, but to eliminate Mr. Psycho's misunderstanding I am writing this verse.
We will also repeat our elders traditions.
We made it by sacrificing lives, and will save it by doing the same.
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
It is very disappointing that the whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
See Liaqat Ali Khan, you will find out that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family from Karnal, in Punjab.
Due to his steps for the migrants, today the migrants consider him as one of them.
There is always a reaction to every action.
One can afford on oneself.
Ejaz Aiwan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the graffiti of real gangsters these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan. They did not face any reaction.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
One Muslim League Q was left, and even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to the People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment to the National Assembly and the Senate.
Until now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment are a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in favor of this amendment, nor has anyone forced the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like after submitting the drafts of the 18th amendment, these parties have done their part. That is, they will be able to say tomorrow that they submitted the draft and the government speaker did not take any action.
How is it possible that MQM coalition partner of the government, Muslim League N an underhand ally of the government and Muslim league Q the party to approve the seventeenth amendment be sincere enough to approve the disapproved amendment?
It's just like writing your name amongst Shaheeds by just putting color on yourself.
The People's Party is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment anyways.
What would one think of getting his own hands cut?
As long as Zardari is the president, the seventeenth amendment is not going to be canceled.
This is the opinion of the majority in our survey takers and so is deemed to be the truth.
If the seventeenth amendment had been canceled then Zardari would never had become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Musharaf because along with being the president he is also the chairman of the People's party.
As long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.
In order to cancel the seventeenth amendment, the political parties will first have to dismiss President Zardari from the presidency.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
Most of the elders from our family belonged to the labor community.
In our childhood, when we used to see our uncles doing labor work, we used to pray to Allah to save us from this hard work.
To avoid this, we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what we should we do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor work.
The editor wrote in reply that we should select certain subjects and become doctors or engineers.
Right from beginning, my trend was towards engineering. I had selected technical drawing instead of Biology as well.
But at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.
I studied biology for a month and then took math as an alternate subject when nothing worked out.
The fear of labor work made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than other in my family, for which I am always thankful to God.
I remembered that when my two sons and I were trying to remove the carpets from our old house.
It was only half an hour since he started working that the little boy said, "Daddy, I am not born to do this".
I said that if this is true, then study a lot like us and get rid of the physical labor.
The son said, "I am studying and I will get through it, but it is the work that I cannot do".
We did that work in three hours and came back home.
The point of this story is that if a person picks his destiny, whatever is the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving that destiny.
Here if you do not know what you have to do then may God help you!
It is said that you should not say bad things about the dead, but what shall we do? We see only bad things in Benazir, even on the anniversary of her first death.
Benazir, for her selfish purpose, crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs after giving the list of the names of those who were fighting for freedom. On the other hand, she gave India the chance to keep its full attention on Kashmir after helping to suppress the Punjab movement.
A tug-of-war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history and has pushed the country back many years.
Benazir continued to give negative comments on Kashmir and the nuclear program after being exiled.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
During her rule, Benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make money. That is why he is known as "Mr. Ten Percent".
During Benazir's rule his brother got killed, but his murderers are still safe from any punishment.
Although she was a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
Just as Benazir conducted her politics over her father's dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came into power twice, but she could not punish the culprits of her father's political murder. Even she couldn't register a case against them.
It has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us, but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
What should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated December 16 as a didactic day and take measures to ensure that this kind of incident doesn't happen again.
On this day, we can send greetings to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again.
The rulers would reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Bahari's stuck in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines.
If only East and West Pakistan could be one together just like East and West Germany was united once again.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem to be granted in the near future.
It was announced today that the governor of Illinois was arrested on corruption charges.
When the state Congress started getting ready to remove him from the position of the governor as soon as possible, then there is this one American companion who has a close watch on the circumstances of Pakistan, boastfully claimed to us that this is what we call democracy.
In America, even the higher level people can not transcend the law.
And there is your country, whose President was made after he had the corruption charges dropped.
We felt our nerve of wit and said, "what if a governor was arrested in America?  In our Pakistan our Prime Minister was once arrested during the night and was hanged.
Tell me if anything like this has happened in America.
Pakistan awarded Guard of Honor and bid farewell from the President's house, who broke the law of the country. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America.
Chief Justice of Pakistan was laid off in such a way that even after the nations support, he has not yet been reinstated. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America.
In Pakistan, a fake degree holder was appointed as Health Minister. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America.
After listening to this, the poor American could not stop laughing and also accepted defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by Americans from all sides.
It seems from his smile
America is with his government. But he is forgetting that last year, the same people were with Parvez Musharaf.
The picture looks like that of a family.
Before that no picture as such has been published in which the President is in the company of 3 American authorities.
Look like that America's work has been increased in Pakistan and one and more Authorities are working on it or they might not believe that person as compared to the first one.
It might be possible that they have planned this also, keeping in mind President Zardari's promise of fulfillment.
Had he been an intelligent politician then he  would be at least not been smiling in this picture and his face would show some signs of embarrassment.
If the principle of democracy applied on this picture than President Zardari is in Minority
In Democracy Majority rules the Nation and who are they picture is showing
The  Swat ares of Pakistan is like heaven on earth and is also known as Switzerland.
Till now, according to the Government Policy, cross talks are  going along together with the use of power.
But the use of power is resulting in increasing the power of Taliban and increasing sympathy for Taliban.It is also not providing any benefits.
The government must, instead of using the power, eliminate the causes of the issue.
by eliminating the causes, Fazlullah and Taliban will automatically disperse.
the Sharia bill proposed by ANP will, to a great extent, become the solution of the problems of Swat.
But besides implementation of the Sharia, the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues.
At the beginning of General Musharaf rise, it looked like the nation had rid itself of the incompetent politicians, but the lust for power changed all his plans.
all the hopes were from the participation in the "War of terror", he had started considering himself immortal.
those steps which were expected, all broke-off.
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, made a deal with the thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army but never know what wass happening to the present government.
Either its Bajor or Swat, the army does not control terror but bombs the ""Enemy"" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy a mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy.
In Swat, the strongly affected part of Sarhad state, despite the continuity of military action for over one year, the situation is still going from bad to worse.
On one side, the government is only reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly. On the other side, the Taliban's illegal radio FM channel is having much more influence in the region.
On the third side, the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region.
During the action of the security forces, there were claims of destroying the fundamentalists by the bombing of gun ship helicopters and cannon houses, but despite these destructions, the Taliban only became more powerful, and according to an estimation, their control over Swat increased that much more.
As a result, on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat, and on the other hand the Taliban is getting stronger.
Who are stuck in between? The poor civilians.
It is said in Swat, that someone asked what kind of people the Taliban were, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of Allah and the religion'.
Then he asked how the army was, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country'.
He then asked who the enemies of the religion and the country were, so he got the answer, 'We civilians'.
I am wondering how the Pakistani Army will fight the Indian Army, when they couldn't control a small faction of the Taliban.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
But still, the FM channel is spreading poison with vigor.
First the girls' schools and now boys' schools are being destroyed.
Curfews are called so that the Taliban can move around easily.
During curfew tonight, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
The question arises as to how they got there despite the curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone convince the army to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the army can defeat any enemy.
You say that mostly blood is spilled in the world because of religion. Tell me, if there was no religion today, would all this killing not take place?
Are Punjabi, Pathan, White, Black, Mahsood and other tribes the result of religion?
No! No way! Sir, religion is what teaches that no one is black or white, punjabi or muhajir. Otherwise, if religion was not present then half world would have vanished for the war between white and black and other half fighting over the status and sect.
Actually, religion gives moral teachings to the man. And binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here. And he should spend his life according to his rules.
As a Muslim, I have total faith that Islam is a complete way of life and a true religion.
After living in London, for many years I used to ask wellness of my family over the telephone every morning, although many did not even call once to find out how we were. It was then I realized that they do not even tolerate our phone calls so we stopped calling.
Living here in France for the last two years, I have also felt the same thing.
I do not know why people expect us to call.
A resolution passed about Iraq in a few hours, Darfar has absolutely no problem in sending peace army.
Bombay attacks were condemned in no time and banning dubious groups is only a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are doing consensus.
O caretakers of international peace, life is finishing here!
Is it for real that every one is waiting for it to end?
So that no other victim will even think about using a great damage causing weapon like a gun to fight for his rights?
Doesn't your heart ache whenever a father runs holding his son's dead body?
If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
But you are a shame to humanity.
At least it was proven that this area was Israel's country for thousands of years.
What should happen is that both the nations should live together happily and with love. But since they are controlled by either west or arab countries,  peace therefore,  cannot be formed here without their consent.
But even Iran wants to fight its proxy war right now.
Even if operations in Israel are halted for the time being, they will start again after another incident.
The interest of BBC's country is subject to the bestowing of America and Israel. And this is the reason why in the name of ""enlightenment"", they have come with a series of blogs based on ""darkness"" and doing one-way and a blind propaganda.
BBC is only completing a formality, and its goal and intent is to gather well wishes.
I request the moderator to publish this comment of Fidwi, so it be known that at least a little bit of affinity towards truth is still remaining in BBC
Thank You.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, Dracula's have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How could I not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time, including Derah Gahzi Khan, summer showers are taking place throughout the country.
Here is a poem according to the weather. Enjoy the weather along with this poem.
These rains are with your presence.
If it rains, it's spring.
If it stays, then it's peace.
Sometimes it comes without a reason.
At times it spreads over day and night.
Sometimes very noisy and sometimes very quiet.
These rains are with your presence.
In a memory, at night.
To buried ash.
Sometimes the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burned itself.
Sometimes each drop seems sorrowful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What it means to them is whether the country lasts or not.
Whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them.
Our media is corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday afternoon something surprising happened.
All of the policemen are running here and there, but aren't asking about illegal parking.
What's more, NYPD traffic was not in the state where it could look at illegally parked vehicles.
What happened was, a plane of the US Air transformed into a ship and landed in the Hudson river.
Until now, we only know that terrorists are descendants of geese.
It was historically cold in New York yesterday.
The temperature usually does not drop like this.
My jaws began to hurt from my thirty minute walk.
Imagine, how the people who jumped from the plane into the water felt.
It is a matter of happiness that all people were safe.
It was also sad that the company's plane sunk during this financial crisis.
I went by the West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I still do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, during my one-hour trip the way had opened at least a bit, so I was able to use the 56th street exit.
When I saw the lines waiting at them, I had not taken the previous two exits.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women.
Shaguftah: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak, to you too.
Sarah: I have slaughtered two chickens and how they are slaughtered and Jahanzeb has already mentioned how I did it.
Apart from this, there is no other way to do it.
At this farm one has to get his own meat done, including removing the skin.
Bossom: It may take some time for the dot net to get fixed
What happened on the forum?
Linko.
To fight with the "Listen to the blog", use Firefox.
Duffer: Khair Mubarak! Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sir please use Firefox.
It will snow till it disappears.
For no reason had we thought that the Taliban group from Sawat was non religious, who were only against women education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
But like majority of the ideas, this was not proven right also. According to this news of CNN, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a Boys school with gunpowder.
The Taliban has destroyed a boys school in Swat.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First".  I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation of the Taliban being against girls education is not true.
Rather, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government less.
May He help them in uprooting the evil government.
Amen, Amen.
Masha Allah, up until now 182 schools have been destroyed.
The stories about various Muslim customs like fixing marriages before birth, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the supposed statements by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight, were not exaggerations.  There was recently a news story from India about a girl who was married to a frog.
See a picture of the bride at the marriage.
Just before this, the wedding between a dog and a girl took place.
Look at that groom.
Humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
It is the era of computers and its involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life.
Many people have reservations over this increasing involvement of the computer in financial matters.
Where use of credit cards bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
So that now, you can be located by transactions from your credit card.
And in future when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent, its benefits will increase more and more.
Similarly in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, it is easier to steal credit card information.
Similarly computers have become the source of friendship.
Social networking sites such as Orkut, Facebook and Myspace have achieved an initial level of acceptance.
Yet, do you think it's possible that the more we use these social networking sites, the further we distance ourselves from people in real life?
Also consider match-making websites, where your preferences are matched to a list of people with similar desires as you.
But do you want to live with a person who is just like you?
I know that I would not want to.  Why else would a spouse be called the better half
unless they can get rid of the faults within me?
Perhaps I have some good sense.
I used to believe that anything that someone older than me said was true.
In the same way, I thought my father knew the answer to every question on earth.
I even used to get laughed at a lot for this.
But only what is possible seems true.
It is very troubling that lies need to be told.
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
That is why I try to lie as least as possible.
that I do not falsely please others in the name of Allah.
And that I say, "Insha Allah", (If God Wills) only when I am asking Allah to complete the work.
As for the intentions, only Allah knows best.
This is a despicable matter that arose due to distance between religions.
According to both our religions and Pakistani law, young children should stay with their mothers.
Their expenses are to be borne by the father, and the father can meet his children.
Then when they become mature, they can live with whom they want.
The actual problems are the relatives who misguide them.
Feudalism has overshadowed our deeds.
Even here is thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in father's property so it is resisted, although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated.
These restrictions regarding relations have created many evils in society.
Concept of remarriage of a divorced women, or a widow is becoming rare.
Due to these unnecessary beliefs and traditions, the family system is facing disarray.
Why is it in our society, if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarries, it is not appreciated?
A Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago,  had all his children married, but when he married a widow, his own children went against him.
In my opinion, this is due to religion, is it not?
What type of mentality is the "'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place" kind of mentality?
I believe that this person's children should have thought what's wrong if he married a widow after he married off all his children?
This widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
As the children would get busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow, if their wives refuse to look after them when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society we are facing for the last 40-50 years.
It is acceptable for a wife to not let her husband marry another women, even if he commits crimes.
If it's in her power, she will not let him do so even after she dies.
Destroys her afterlife along with her husband's, while spreading immorality in the society.
Nothing happens with singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, preventing girls from being educated, and fear of love and marriage.
And about your question, when a man instead of bringing his wife home goes to someone else's wife, the dependents just make a fuss for the show then stay quiet and satisfied. (Later the relatives of the wife get angry.)
In the Indian subcontinent, we accepted Islam centuries ago but we still thought of culture and tradition as being more valuable than Islam.
In this way of thinking a man's 2nd marriage is considered ridiculous, divorce is seen as denigration, the divorced are untouchable, love in marriage is dishonorable, and a man marrying an older woman is devaluation of women.    Considering man's 2nd marriage as ridiculous, divorce as denigration, divorced as untouchable, love marriage as dishonor and considering a man marrying an older women is dissimulation of the women is only the result of this way of thinking.
By copying the western world we are declaring the religious and veiled to be old fashioned.
Accepting Islam was easy, but getting rid of the old ways of thinking is very hard.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Amen.
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.
Centuries passed with such little writing.
Know that little is much.
Allah Hafiz
Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes, "I found this secret in my life that if the leader of any army is in the front line then that army will never lose."
But that's not the situation here.
They say that common people are there to die for us and they die as martyrs.
But when the common man dies it's murder.
May Allah bless and have mercy on you.
When I was coming back to the shop after Isha prayer tonight, one man who was sitting in his car raised his hand and asked me to come.
I thought maybe this man has forgotten his way or maybe he wants to ask something. I stopped, and his whole family was in his car.
He asked if I can understand Arabic very well or not. I said that there is no problem. You can tell me what is the matter.
He started saying, I have come from Riyadh but here some one in Medina picked my pocket and I need help. I said no, because this has happened with me earlier also as I gave this man 20 riyals to pay for gas and go back to Riyadh but he started doing the same thing after moving forward a little.
I got really angry and when I threatened to tell the police, he vanished.
So now this is the condition of us Muslims that even when we come to beg money, we come with families riding in cars and daily manage to get at least 2 or 3000.
Although there is an saying of the Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the hand above is better than the hand below and the hand above is the giving hand the lower is the taking hand.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims (Amen)

The wife of the famous singer Adnan Sami went to a police station in Bombay accusing him of torturing her.
The police station suggested for her to contact a court.
Adnan Sami's wife, Saba Guladari, submitted a plea against her husband stating that Adnan Sami tortures her continuously.
and treats her inhumanely.
This has exceeded her tolerance limit, therefore a case should be recorded against Adnan Sami.
Police, instead of recording a report, suggested that she should contact the court by saying that this matter is not what is covered under police control.
In your opinion, is the accusation of Adnan Sami's wife on him correct?
What if this accusation is an attempt of tarnishing the name of Adnan Sami?
Let us know of your comments regarding this matter.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
As far as allegations are concerned, anyone can post it on someone else.
Nothing comes before prestige.
however may be the relations between Adnan Sami and his present wife, he left his respectful life and went to India to make money and now this fame has caught him badly.
This is a consequence of his own deeds.
Washington...
Top American officials say that president Obama will take a strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
In the new American policy over Afghanistan there is more emphasis on war than development.
Officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in the achievement of American goals Since in his government, there is corruption, drugs business has increased and Taliban are regaining their power.
American officials say that people, who are putting more pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more, include vice president Joe Biden and President Obama's representative for Afhanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke.
He said that this good administration was noticed after President Bush left, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai every 2 weeks, which used to emphasize the role of America in Afghanistan and the development of its city departments.
Officials say that the Obama administration will work with state leaders as a backup to the main government.
Officials say that they will emphasize to Hamid Karzai the importance of fighting against corruption.
Hamid Karzai faces new elections this year. It is not yet clear whether Obama and his administration will favor his re-election or not.
Is this statement of the American officials a forecast of change in America's policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is this era of Hamid Karzai ending?
What are your thoughts in this matter?
In the series of three one-day matches between Pakistan and Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan with a score of 2-1.
Pakistan defeated Sri Lanka in the first day's match, but Sri Lanka won the next two matches.
In the third match, the nation's team performance was very poor. They scored only 75 runs in 23 overs against 309 runs made by the national team of Sri Lanka, and this is how we were defeated.
The result of the series proves that the National team has no consistency in its performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
Which facets of the game should be addressed most by the authorities?
Are you satisfied with the selections for the team?
Which department would you hold responsible for the defeat- the fielding, batting or bowling department?
Please provide your feedback.
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kinds of heathenish traditions continue to occur. These feudal lords target innocent people using their authority, who would call them Muslims?
A Sardar, himself should walk over these embers. Why doesn't the present government act against them?
When will the judicial justice be of use?
The Shrilanken cricket team has arrived Karachi to play One Day internationals.
Besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
Upon reaching the Karachi airport, the Srilankan team was very warmly welcomed.
Two one days between Pakistan and Srilanka in Karachi, whereas the third one day will be played in Lahore.
Both teams have there claims over bowling, batting and fielding.
If the Srilankans are proud of their spinners, the Pakistanis trust their fast bowlers.
Srilankan Captain Mahela Jayvardena has said that not a single player but the whole team from Pakistan is dangerous
Murli dharan and Mendis will be the trump cards whereas the Pakistan Captain says that it will be a tough competition.
Shoaib Malik has said that "We have played Murli dharan and we'll see Mendis as well. We have prepared a secret game plan and we shall implement that in the ground"
Will the Pak-Srilanka Series be really as interesting and exciting as they claim are?
Who will dominate the series between Pakistan and Srilanka?
Who will win the series?
Who will be the man of the series?
Give your opinion.
Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.

The Kashmiri people have been fighting for independence for the last 60 years.
No, no one asked, and they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism, so they start talking about making up.
First they openly killed the Muslims, now they are trying to set things right.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating such a situation so that the world's attention can be diverted from Kashmir.
But Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now the British Government is also understanding that the Indians are taking cover from their occupation over Kashmir by accusing Pakistan of terrorism.
They hesitate to talk to Pakistan about this issue.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that resolving the issue of Kashmir will bring an end to extremism, and the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
It should be clear that newly-elected American President Obama has also expressed similar views about the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister has written in an article and told the media that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of President Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
Due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Is India using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialog?

Usman Aftab,
I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
Rather it wants to keep it in check, and hence is thinking of taking certain steps. They know that Pakistan is a nuclear state.
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries are only thinking that if they corner Pakistan, they would face some political and geographic problems. They want to help Pakistan, but also want to be successful in their goal.
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife, and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn Pakistan.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.

Ras al Khaima, This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but they  know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is now deep waters.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden, played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers movement not played any role?
What do you have to say about this statement, in regards to the Prime Minister?
Make us aware of your opinion.
American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference, advised newly elected President, Barack Obama. Former president G.W. Bush said that he had made many mistakes in his presidency and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
'I did, as a president, whatever I felt was appropriate, according to the situation, and the American law and constitution, giving preference to American interest over my own acceptance'.
President Bush said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him, and considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this would be his last press conference, and thanked the journalists and other friends who were present in the press conference.
Do you think Obama will repeat the mistakes that Bush made?
Did Bush delay accepting his mistake?
Will Obama be able to follow Bush's advice?
Give us your opinion.
American Vice President Dick Cheney said, "I want to see Osama Bin Laden alive or dead."
He said that Osama Bin Laden is hiding in some hard to reach area and is of no use to his organization, and if Osama Bin Laden is arrested alive or dead then his organization must be destroyed.
America intends to arrest Osama and the search for Osama is on.
Will Dick Cheney's goal to arrest Osama be accomplished?

After the completion of Quaid Azam Trophy match between PIA and Habib Bank, the all-rounder cricketer Shahid Affridi had a altercation with one fan.
When Shahid Affridi came out of the drawing room after playing the match on the UBL ground, a large number of fans gathered around him.
In one instance, a fan held his hand and asked to take a photo with him, after which Shahid Affridi removed his hand from the fan's and said that he can take the photo tomorrow. After further insistence from the fan, Affridi became angry and slapped him. An altercation then began between Affridi and the fan, though the crowd seemed to dismiss the matter there.
Shahid Affridi later said that he had been in a hurry to attend the prayer.
Nevertheless, I shall apologize to that spectator.
What would you say about this behavior of Shahid Afridi?

The Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, has once again accused Pakistan of provoking a war.
Pakistan is using terrorism as a state policy.
While addressing a Chief Minister's conference in New Delhi, Manmohan Singh said that the terrorist elements are backed by neighboring countries and especially Pakistan.
The terrorists of the Mumbai attacks used the far out to sea route and were safe from the Indian coast guards.
The Indian Prime Minister said that the November attacks were carried out by Lashkare Taiba.
He added that the terrorists are using modern techniques and the latest communication systems and said, "We'll have to be more rigorous over the line of control where the intrusion takes place". He said that terrorism will not be tolerated in any case and that is their policy.
How do you see this allegation from the Indian Prime Minister?
Do the internally opposed and separatist movements of India show the disturbed situation in India?
On whose orders is India taking this warning stance?
Give us your views.

This is a sad calamity that Israel is massacring the Palestinians and the same situation is prevalent in Kashmir, but there is no effect on the Security Council.
All the organizations present in Palestine and Kashmir should keep their war going until they gain independence, and they should form unity among themselves and keep facing any type of harm, and eventually their martyrdom will give fruit, God Willing.
The air attacks by Israel on Gaza are continuing just the same. Until now, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
Important Hamas leader Nazariyan was killed along with his wife and children.
Here the Security Council meeting concluded without any decision.
The meeting saw American opposition to the derogatory resolutions passed against Israel by Libya and other Arab countries.
For the last few days there have been bombings by Israeli planes on the Palestinian civilian population.
The whole world cried out about the Mumbai issue, but the Israeli attacks do not seem to matter to anyone including America and Britain.
Why are the important Islamic countries quiet?
What can say about this double standard of the world?
Saeed, New York
I think that most of our people are ignorant. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties. The electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has taken a serious position.
On the other side, there was an increase of an average of 18% in gas rates, while the unavailability of petrol in some cities has become a cause of great difficulty for the public.
Among the manufacturing and business circles, there are strong protests and severe protests against the long power cut and gas crisis.
The producers have given the ultimatum to close the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is perturbed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
The production life cycle has become practically paralyzed.
The government institutions are blaming each other to explain their stances.
Are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas a joke against the nation?
Why is attention not being paid to solve the problems?
Are the wheels of national development not seeming jammed to the government?
What immediate steps can you suggest to gain control over this crisis?
Let us know your opinions.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that government is carrying slogan of public service is itself hurting them.
The unavailability of electricity, gas, and petrol has become a persecution.
Government has no control over the institutions.
Law and order is deteriorating every day, may Allah bestow his mercy on this country.
The new year has started.
Last year was the year of outbreaks and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered in reference to the terrorism.
The stepping down of President Musharf and the end of the eight years rule of president Bush; throwing of shoes on Bush and formation of democratic government in Pakistan; calamities; earthquake in Baluchistan; global financial slump and monopoly.
The new year is arriving, how do you foresee it?
In your opinion, what will be the result of the political or geographical situation? What will be Obama's strategy?
Is there a hope of a development towards eliminating terrorism?
Will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?
What turn will the Indo-Pakistani relations take?
Is there any chance of a surgical strike, or maybe a full-fledged war?
What are your expectations for the new year?

It is the first anniversary of the death of Benazir Bhutto. She was slain after an election rally in Liaqat Bagh, Rawalpindi on December 27th, 2007.
Unfortunately, Benazir is not among us today. She was a thoughtful politician and a world renowned figure. She held a special status in national politics.
It's been a full year now, yet the enigma of her death still remains unsolved.
Benazir's efforts to bring democracy to Pakistan were not in vain.
Today a democratic government exists in Pakistan and her husband, Asif Zardari, currently holds the position of Pakistan President.
What do you think if the role of martyr Benazir Bhutto is in Pakistani politics?
Who can be her behind murdering?
Recently,, she was given the global human rights award. What would you like to say about her democratic and political services?
After ruling over America for eight years, President Bush left the White House, for presidential camp office, Camp David, so that the White House can be decorated and prepared for new President Barack Obama, according to his wishes.
In Bush's eight year presidency, the historic World Trade Center attack, the attack on the Pentagon, the action against Afghanistan and Iraq in the name of a global war against terrorism, in which armies of many countries were pulled into the war, and American resources were completely exhausted, were some of the memorable events of the Bush era.
As a result of this war, America had to face the worst economic and financial crisis in history.
What do you think the world got and what do you think it lost as a result of this war?
Were the policies of President Bush successful?
What are your views of the Bush era?
The Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from touring Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one-day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, when interviewed by Jeev News, said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour.  Due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip due to the present political situation a proper step? Shouldn't sports be separate from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that the security conditions are so bad in India, the England cricket team is continuing its tour. So why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this matter?

Their are people who are proud about going to India.
They make their films and videos over there. Their eyes should now be open to how much the people of India respect them.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami should return to Pakistan first chance he gets because respect did not suit you there either.
Fareed Ahmed

Indian's attitude has changed after Bombay Attacks.
Jagjit Singh has showed in  his reaction  that he hates Pakistan and Pakistani.
One should know that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsley. How is he a bad singer now? Adnan Sami should stay in India, there is no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshaad Alam
Karachi, On the statement of Jagjit Singh, I would only say that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! Open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Bombay incident, their hateful statements have increased. The same people are now saying evil things against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
According to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said ""You dog this is a farewell kiss""
After that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards Bush. president Bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself.
The second shoe hit the American Flag.
Security personnels dragged the journalist away from there.
at this point, president Bush said that he didn't know why he had done so , Shoe was of number 10, I had no problem.
Do you think this reaction of the journalist wasn't an expression of deprecation or President bush from the Iraqi people?
What would you say on this incident?
The tension between Pakistan and India's relations after the terrorism in Mumbai got further intense when the fighter planes from the Indian Air force violated the Pakistani airspace in Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
As a result of retaliation from Pak Air force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
Sources say that both Indian planes were loaded with ammunition.
This is the first of its kind incident in the current tensed situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that it is ready to defend the country.
Information Minister Sherry Rahman says that Indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed, although this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
In your opinion, does India really have an intention of an air strike on Pakistan?
Is this statement of India correct that this violation was a mistake or this was to find out the ability of the Pakistan Air Force?
Is this incident not going to aggravate the current estrangement among the two countries?

Respected martyr Benazir Bhutto was given the International Award for Human Rights after her death, which was received by her son and chairperson of the People's Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
During a session of the General Assembly in the United Nations headquarters, the former prime minister of Pakistan, martyr Benazir Bhutto, was presented with this award for acknowledgment of her efforts for human rights in a ceremony.
The 60th anniversary of the passing of the human rights resolution by the United Nations was celebrated on the 10th of December.
Among those people and institutes being honored on the occasion for working for human rights, apart from Benazir Bhutto, were:  former American Attorney General, Louis Ramsey Clark, and the Human Rights Watch, the organization that works around the world for human rights.
On this occasion, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations Abdullah Husain Harun and other senior embassy agents were present.
What do you think about the former martyr Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto receiving this award?
Samir

It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she completely changed.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party and made her son the representative of the People's Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi, This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
But until the iron ax is fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are just like this, in that they are adopting secretive ways. This is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations has included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed and two other Pakistani citizens, and that of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organizations in their list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, the practically non-existent organization Lashkar-e-Taiba's Operation Chief Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi, and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, a Saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek, was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organizations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, Al-Rasheed Trust, and Al-Akhtar Trust International.
The host countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organizations, and they will be restricted from traveling and will be placed under arrest.
They will have to face charges.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India accusing these organizations of responsibility for the Mumbai Attacks without any proof?
Doesn't India have any local terrorist groups ?
Aren't the world organizations aware of the persecution of minorities in India?
