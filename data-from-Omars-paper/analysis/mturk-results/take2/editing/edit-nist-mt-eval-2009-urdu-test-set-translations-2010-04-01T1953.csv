Karachi,Pakistan,,,Sindh,I think asking Hamas to give up their struggle for the sake of peace is unfair to millions of widows and orphans. It is similar to prove them unsuccessful.,It seems God has asked to annihilate all others than Muslims,If the  Pharaoh-ism of US and Israel is on rise then Moses will come to counter them because every Pharaoh has a Moses.The American and Israelis actions are producing suicide bombers among Muslims.,Power has abandoned their ability to think and understand.,Abu Abdullah&#44; Pakistan,Now Hamas and Israel should seize fire to stop bloodshed.,Mohammad Sarfraz&#44; Paris&#44; France,rightly said,Suppose Hamas is on right path and struggling against cruelty for the sake of God&#39;s will; they should know that an act of goodness does not remain good if it causes harms to others.,Love for humanity is the precondition for God and his prophet&#39;s love.,,,ur-en,urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post217__2,urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post27__1,urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post217__3,urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post217__4,urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post217__5,urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post230__1,urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post230__2,urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post230__3,urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post230__4,urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post230__5

Bangalore,India,no,yes,Karnataka,They command even after they die.,They are also servants of Allah and so is the army.,But there is an international game being played over here.

At one side Europe and America are assured that the military is sincere in achieving a terror free state but on the other hand helps the Taliban in disguise.,Now we have to think and define our path and select one path to focus on&#44; Thank you.,There is no doubt that the elements of Jamat-ud-dawa include majority of those people who belong to Lashkar-e-Taiba which is a banned organization&#44; is now established and operating with a new name Jamat-ud-dawa Pakistan.,However after that more focus was diverted towards humanitarian activities and now on India&#39;s strong request &#44; the United Nations has also banned it and the government of Pakistan has also implemented a crack down on this organization.,In my opinion if these Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and get focused towards religion and humanitarian assistance then it is much better.,The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan which have used the name of Jihad to induct and nurture professional killers and criminals and their molana&#39;s are the same people who called Pakistan &#39;Plaeedistan&#39; meaning un clean land. These are the people who use bad named for Pakistan.,Now they are trying their best to destroy Pakistan.,In reality they don&#39;t even get close to be called a Muslin&#44; in fact they deserve to be called animals or barbarians,16,20,ur-en,urd-NG-102-174502-11516161-post112__1,urd-NG-102-174502-11516161-post150__4,urd-NG-102-174502-11516161-post112__2,urd-NG-102-174502-11516161-post112__3,urd-NG-102-174502-11516161-post13__1,urd-NG-102-174502-11516161-post13__2,urd-NG-102-174502-11516161-post13__3,urd-NG-102-174502-11516161-post150__1,urd-NG-102-174502-11516161-post150__2,urd-NG-102-174502-11516161-post150__3

Kannur,India,no,no,Kerala,Instead of using power&#44; government should find out the real causes of the problem.,The army could not put down the terror in Baajodoh and Swat. The commoners are subjected to &quot;&quot;bombardments and enmity&quot;&quot; i.e&#44; creating great loss to lives and properties. It also puts them into psychological disorder.,Fazalullah and Taliban will dissolve into nothingness if the root causes are terminated.,The Shariat bill suggested by the                                                                 The Shariat bill suggested by the ANP administration will&#44; to a great extent&#44; bring a solution for the problems in Swat.              a,But&#44; in addition to the observance of the Shariat law&#44; the administration will take care of the well being of the people.,The actions of General Musharaf made us believe that we had been made free from the unqualified politicians of the land. But&#44; his ambition for more power changed everything.,How many expectations were there! He lost all hopes in &quot;&quot;war and terror&quot;&quot;.,Hopes of taking actions were lost.,It seemed that he understood that the end of his reign was imminent along with the end of Bush administration.

Lahore,Pakistan,,,Punjab,The conditions in the  terrorism struck area Swat in the Frontier Province are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area,I am astonished&#44; how the Pakistan Army will fight with the Indian Army&#44; while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban&#39;s.,On the one side the governments writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side the effect of Taliban&#39;s unlawful radio is increasing everday in Swat.,On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.,The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban&#39;s has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.,The result is that on the one side the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other hand the Taliban has established their hold.,In between who got grinded&#44; the poor citizens.,It is said that in Swat somebody asked&#44; which type of people are the Taliban&#39;s are? The answer was  &quot;&quot;very good people because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country&quot;&quot;.,Then asked how is Army&#44; the answer was that the Army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.,Then it was asked&#44; who are the enemies of religion and country&#44; the answer was &quot;&quot;the citizens&quot;&quot;,,,ur-en,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__1,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post5__1,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__2,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__3,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__4,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__5,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__6,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__7,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__8,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__9
Rawalpindi,Pakistan,,,Punjab,Despite the military operation in Swat&#44; a war-torn area of NWFP&#44; things are getting worse.,I am greatly astonished&#44; how the Army of Pakistan will fight against Indian Army. It has failed to  control a small group of Talibans.,On one hand the writ of GOVT is limited to a resolution of condemnation passed by National assembly while on other hand the influence of Taliban&#39;s FM channel is increasing in swat.,The common citizen has no choice but to obey the rule of power.,In swat security forces have used lethal weapons and have claimed to kill many extremists. But despite these causalities&#44; Taliban&#39;s Power is rising. They are controlling nearly 80% area of Swat.,Result: GOVT is not accepting its failure and Talibans are getting stronger,The poor citizen is the only looser.,&quot;&quot;how are the Talibans&quot;&quot; asked by someone in Swat. It is answered as &quot;&quot;They are very good; they are fighting the war against the enemies of God&quot;&quot;,Then asked about the army. Answer was &quot;&quot;very good&#44; it is fighting against the enemies of our country&quot;&quot;,Who are the enemies of religion and country? &quot;&quot;The poor citizens&quot;&quot;&#44; it was answered.,,,ur-en,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__1,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post5__1,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__2,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__3,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__4,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__5,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__6,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__7,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__8,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__9

On the other side&#44; the Taliban&#39;s illegal radio FM channel is having much more influence in the region.,On the third side&#44; the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region.,During the action of the security forces&#44; there were claims of destroying the fundamentalists by the bombing of gun ship helicopters and cannon houses&#44; but despite these destructions&#44; the Taliban only became more powerful&#44; and according to an estimation&#44; their control over Swat increased that much percent more.,As a result&#44; on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat&#44; and on the other hand the Taliban is stronger.,Who is stuck in  between? The poor civilians.,It is said in Swat&#44; that someone asked what kind of people are the Taliban were&#44; so he got the answer&#44; &#39;They are very good&#44; as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of Allah and the religion&#39;.,Then he asked how the army was&#44; so he got the answer&#44; &#39;They are very good&#44; as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country&#39;.,He then asked who the enemies of the religion and the country were&#44; so he got the answer&#44; &#39;We civilians&#39;.,15,23,ur-en,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__1,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post5__1,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__2,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__3,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__4,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__5,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__6,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__7,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__8,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post1__9

Islamabad,Pakistan,,,Islamabad,They are unable to track the illegal FM radio channel of Taliban.

This will improve the image of Pakistan Army.,He has said that religion is the reason of bloodshed; kindly tell me if it would be a peaceful world without any concept of religion?,,,ur-en,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post5__2,urd-WL-77-174260-11358578-post2__2,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post5__3,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post5__4,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post5__5,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post5__6,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post5__7,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post5__8,urd-WL-77-174260-11358562-post5__9,urd-WL-77-174260-11358578-post2__1

But still i continued to do so. But the time when i felt that my relatives dont even like my calling them&#44; i stopped making calls to them ever after.,Even i have felt the same here since i have spent my two years of life in France.,Why people keep expectation only from us to make a phone call to them in Patna.,About Iraq&#44; within a few hours there would be an Army sent for the &quot;&quot;peace&quot;&quot; in the Darfar.

Riyadh,Saudi Arabia,no,yes,Ar Riyad,It is acceptable for a wife that her husband does unlawful actions but she does not let him marry another woman.,Accepting Islam was easy&#44; getting rid of this way of thinking is very hard.,If its in her power&#44; she will not let him do so even after she dies.,Destroys her afterlife along with her husbands&#39;.And also lets spreading of the immorality in the society.,Nothing happens with singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.,For example&#44; keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.,And about your question&#44; when sir instead of bringing his wife home&#44; goes to someone else&#39;s wife so the dependents just make a fuss for the show and stay quiet and satisfied. ( yeah&#44; later the relatives of the wife get angry),In the Indian subcontinent&#44; we accepted Islam centuries ago but we could not let go of this illiterate thinking and always thought of culture and tradition as more valuable than Islam.,Considering man&#39;s 2nd marriage as ridiculous&#44; divorce as denigration&#44; divorced as untouchable&#44; love marriage as dishonor and considering a man marrying an older women is dissimulation of the women is only the result of this way of thinking.,And over all&#44; by copying the western world&#44; we are declaring the religious and veil as old fashioned.,20,27,ur-en,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post6__2,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post9__4,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post6__3,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post6__4,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post7__1,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post7__2,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post7__3,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post9__1,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post9__2,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post9__3

Bangalore,India,no,yes,Karnataka,A wife can accept her husband going around having illicit relations&#44; but she cannot stand him having a second wife.,Accepting Islam is easy&#44; but leaving this mentality is very tough.,If possible&#44; stop him from doing so&#44; even after you die.,She destroys her husband and her own hereafter&#44; and becomes a cause for spreading filthiness in the society.,Chanting Islam&#44; Islam does not mean anything. In reality&#44; we like only our culture and traditions.,For instance keeping girls  from gaining education and fearing marrying the girl of ones choice.,As for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house&#44; so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax&#44; (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt).,In the Indo Pak subcontinent&#44; Islam was accepted centuries ago&#44; but it could not yet leave its ignorant mentality and has always kept culture and tradition above Islam.,Thinking of a man&#39;s second marriage as an innovation&#44; divorce as a clinical rest&#44; divorced woman as untouchable&#44; love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife&#44; is all a part of this mentality.,What&#39;s more&#44; in mimicry of the western countries&#44; we have started to consider piety and veil as old fashioned.,15,23,ur-en,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post6__2,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post9__4,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post6__3,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post6__4,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post7__1,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post7__2,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post7__3,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post9__1,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post9__2,urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post9__3
