'First Nuclear Experiment - 1990'
The books is authored by Americans Thomas Reed, a former weapon designer at the Lever National Laboratory, and Danny Stillman, the former director of technical intelligence at Los Alamos National Laboratory.
The book is titled 'Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and Its Proliferation.' The authors claim that the first country to make a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets or had the support of another country.
in an interview with US news, Thomas Reed said that in 1990, during the rule of Benazir Bhutto, China texted Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Thomas Reid said that, for many reasons, he believes that China had tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
These reasons include the design of the bomb and information gleaned from talks with the Chinese scientists.
He further added that China's assistance allowed Pakistan to, in only two weeks and three days, carry out nuclear testing in response to that of India in 1998.
Thomas Reed recalled that, in 1961, Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear test. Although the U.S. had possessed the bomb for decades, it was 17 days before it conducted its own nuclear test in response.
He said further that in May 1998, the atom bomb that Pakistan tested was made with care, and Pakistani scientists were completely trusted for it.
When Thomas Reed was asked if China supplied atomic technology to Pakistan, he replied that India is a mutual enemy of Pakistan and China.
He said  evidence was also present that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan had used the Chinese model. Later the Libyan documents confirmed this.
Another question was about mutual nuclear experiment. He replied that Anees Sonway openly performed a nuclear experiment in the desert of Nevada for Britain.
He said Israel was predicted to have access to the results of this experiment.
Thomas Reeds was also asked if China was continuing nuclear proliferation.
On this Thomas Reeds said that China has been supplying raw material, instructions and the design to an Iranian nuclear facility in Asfahan.
Apart from this, China has also provided Iran with an enrichment plant in Kheeraj.
He said that China had been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Rome, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen via North Korea.

President Asif Ali Zardari took the oath from the new ministers.

Azam Swati was elected as a free senator and is considered to be one of the richest.

Bolochistan, Blasted Pipeline
According to police, this is a 18-inch diameter pipeline which connects different wells of Parekoh and meets the Suyi gas pipeline. This was blasted by unidentified men in the early morning.
Apart from this, yesterday, well number 3 near Suyi had been totally destroyed by a blast and a gas pipeline near Dera-allayar was also damaged due to a blast.
Militant organization Baloch republican army's spokeperson, Saryaz Baluch, accepted the responsibility for these blasts on the behalf of his organization.
As 2009 began, there was an increase in violent incidents in Baluchistan.
This month, until now, several gas pipelines have been blasted.  Attacks on trains and on people belonging to the Punjab region have also increased.
Though the Prime Minister of Baluchistan, Nawab Aslam Rayisani, has expressed concern over such activities and ordered the police to exchange information from intelligence agencies, stopping such incidents has not been possible yet.
819 billion dollars package for economic revival approved.
All members of the Republican party voted against President Obama's plan.
Members of the Republican party said that the economic plan is very expensive and will not prove effective.
In the members assembly, 240 votes were drawn in favor of this package, while 160 were drawn against it.
This economic revival plan will be presented next week in the Senate, where the ruling Democratic party has very little majority.
Concern is being expressed that great opposition from the Republican party may not make it easy for Senate approval.
After the economic revival plan was approved by the members assembly, Barrack Obama urged members to look past political differences, and work together on this plan.
President Obama said that this plan, which he was hopeful would become law by next month, will prove to create a peaceful atmosphere in the country, which will stimulate the American economy.
According to this plan, working-class people will be relieved of 275 billion dollars worth of debt, and 540 billion dollars will be paid for roads, bridges, schools, unemployment allowance and research for new technology.
BBC writer Richard Luster in Washington has stated that Barrack Obama intended to introduce a new political culture by putting back the political disagreements but discussion this Economic Package has once again made political pillars sore.
Republican party members in the assembly declared the bill proposed by the government a waste of government money, and they said that this will not help in creating new jobs.
They insisted on the bill proposed by their party in which attention has been given to reduced taxes.
They said that through their package, less investment is required to create more chances of livelihood.
They said that instead of construction plans, reduced taxes can create more jobs instantly.
Bitterness among Israeli president and Turkish Prime Minister
Rajab Tayyab Erdogan almost shouted at Israeli President and said that the blood of many people has been shed in Gaza. He felt sorrow watching that people can actually applaud this military action from Israel.
Mr. Erdogan said that, "I think you are using such words to erase your guilt and that in a high voice. But you killed people and I am remembering those children who were killed near the shore."
Shamoon Parez said that Gaza's pain is not Israel, but that it is instead Hammas who has founded a dangerous dictatorship there.
A correspondent of BBC from Davis said that nothing like this has been seen before in an international economic forum.
Although, Erdogan said later that he respects the Israeli president and also his age due to which he did not shout at him but what he was saying was miles away from truth.
Turkey is one of the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, but for the last few years there has been tension between them.
The attacks were not planned in Pakistan.
Speaking to Indian news channel NDTV, Wajid Shamsul Hasan, said that the report of the Pakistani investigations into the Mumbai blast will be prepared soon.
In the attacks that took place in Mumbai last Novemeber, more than 170 people were killed.
India claims that extremist group Lashkar-e-Taiba is responsible for the attacks.
India also said that Pakistani "state factors" were responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
The Mumbai attacks affected relations between the two countries.
High commissioner Wajid Shamsul Hasan gave his first statement about the report of the Pakistani investigations, from which it becomes evident as to what is within the report.
Wajid Shamsul Hasan said that as far as the investigation has deteremined, Pakistani land has not been used.
It must be some other place, not England.
These are the two places (Pakistan and Britain) about which I was worried.
India and the international community have created a lot of pressure on Pakistan to take action against the culprits of the Mumbai attacks.
Wajid Shamsul Haq said: We are not trying to cover it up.
We believe in taking action based on facts.
The world will accept our investigations.
We will try to satisfy India over the results of the investigation.
While defending the delay in the investigation in Pakistan, he said that it takes time to collect, understand and check these kind of things.
High Commissioner Wajid Shamsul Haq said that it took 45 days for India to present its dossier.
A black man elected as the republican leader too.
In the sixth round of elections in the Republican party, Michael Steel has won, receiving 91 votes out of 168.
During the election for the position of chairman of the party, Katen Dawsen, candidate opposite to Steel, obtained 70 votes. Whereas former chairman Dunken abdicated from the competition in the second round.
People say that from the five candidates who stood for the position of the chairmanship of the Republican party, Michael Steel was considered the most conservative among them.
After his win, Michael Steel said in his speech, "We are saying to our friends and enemies together, to come with us but those who will cause problems in this, be prepared to separate from us." Michael Steel is from Maryland where he has also been the Deputy governor.
He became famous in 2006 when he stood for a seat in the Senate.
But after losing in the Senate elections, he was appointed as the chairman of one political conservative committee of the party.
Now after being selected as the chairman of the party, the efforts of the Republican party campaign in the entire country will be under his supervision.
He fought elections for the promise that he will give the party a new cause. He will also use a new technique to join conservative supporters to the party.
Indian claims presence of Lashker-e-Tayyaba and Josh-e-Muhammad in Jammu.
There is news of presence of terrorists in the Poonch Tribal area of Jammu.
According to official sources, police and army surrounded the area and started the search on receiving secret information.
During this, a fight started in which four militants, two soldiers and one policeman were killed.
According to the sources, fights were going on until the last news broke.  In this area, where militants associated with Lashker-e-Tayyaba and Josh-e-Muhammad are present, more soldiers have been sent to fight them.
During this, chief minister Omer Abdullah, nominated by the involved officials, met with the governor.  He directly gave the news of the Assembly leader's election from his party national conference.
Congress, the ally of the National Conference, also informed the governor of their advocacy of Omar Abdullah.
Omar Abdullah will take oath as the chief minister of the state.
Remember, the National Conference became the biggest party by gaining 28 seats in the 87 member assembly in the current state elections. Keep in mind that separatist parties boycotted the elections.
Congress, which secured 17 seats, accepted to form a coalition government with the National Conference.
Today, party workers welcomed Omar Abdullah with great fanfare on his arrival in Srinagar.
On this occasion, Omar Abdullah says that he will play his role in making the talks possible between the Indian government and separatists. However, this will not be possible until the elections in India and formation of the new government.
Role of EU for Peace in the Middle East.
From the official point of view, the role of the European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
According to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
European Union's spokesman Amadeu Altafaj has said that every such effort is admirable which is helpful in sending the European Union's message to the opponents of the war.
It seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned.
But in reality the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
As the head of the Union, the Czech Republic's role is even weaker than before.
And on top of that the internal issues have made it helpless.
On the other hand, the French president Sarkozy is behaving as if he is still the president of the European Union.
Whereas France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it.
The French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, is faced with a strange situation.
He is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of the Czech Republic, Schwarzenberg.
The problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the Middle East war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense, whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. Moreover, Germany has sent its special ambassador to the Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.
Its proof is the Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.
This is a golden chance for the European Union to do something since America, due to the policies of George W. Bush, has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial Crisis: Suicide of a billionaire German industrialist.
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany, left a huge business group behind him.
But, a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.
When he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines. Then he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 and  one billion euro loan it needed immediately , so Merkle went into deep pressure.
Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had gone from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic power.
After the death of his father, Adolf Merkel took over his family business. He developed it quick, putting it on new lines.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm,the  Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm, always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine."
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the management of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have sanctioned 400 million Euros in floating loans for his group. But under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.
Like this, after the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain the same as it was.
Crime rate among the immigrants in Germany
According to the fresh statistics, crime rate among the immigrants from 2004 to 2007 is
Reduced from 9.22%
to 4.21%
According to Joachim Herrmann, the interior minister of Baweria province, this is apparently a positive change.
He said: "It is important to note that the number of foreigners getting German citizenship is increasing."
Therefore this should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German, his background is foreign.
Herrmann said that his province will take this into account when gathering statistics in 2010.
Besides Baweria, Hamburg is also thinking within the same lines.
A senator for foreign affairs from CDU, Christoph Ahlhaus, has said: "When research is done in a scientific manner, man can not pre-decide its results but it is based on the facts and figures that come out as a result of the research."
Ahlhaus diverted attention to a research report from the anti-crime provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamburg, it was discovered that out of all crimes happening there is a percentage that have the involvement of foreigners.
results showed that the foreigners here have
Tthe crime rate was less as compared to crime all over the province.
By contrast, when a survey was done in 2006 on crimes in youth in Berlin, it was determined that young people having foreign background had a percentage of 44%.
was 7 percent
However, other political parties of Germany for example, SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei,were against this proposal that while collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired which German citizens have foreign backgrounds.
We want quick evacuation of troops from Gaza: Olmert
Ehud Olmert has stressed that for complete evacuation of the army, a future and permanent ceasefire agreement is inevitable.
Hamas and Israel declared ceasefire on Sunday.

A video message for Germany from Al-Qaeda
In this 30-minute video message, a man wearing a black turban with a covered face and holding a gun gives a message to the German Government.
Abu Talha is introducing himself and speaking in German language.
There are Arabic sub-titles of this video message.
The logo of Al-Qaida  is on the side of the screen and the date written is October 2008.
In this message it is said to the German government that after deploying such a large number of troops in Afghanistan, this country is thinking that it will not be attacked. If it's not ingeniousness then what else?
Introducing himself as Abu Talha, this man however did not threaten to directly attack Germany.
The number of German troops amongst the Allied NATO forces in Afghanistan is around 3500.
Last year the German parliament approved a bill to send one thousand more troops to Afghanistan.
This is the first message to Germany from Al-Qaida.
Having a critical eye on terrorism related issues, the famous expert Mikhail Luders says: "the recent suicide attack on the German embassy in Kabul is a proof of the fact that we should take it seriously in any case."
For the past few years Al-Qaida has been issuing video messages on the internet and there have been attacks after such messages.
On Saturday, the Taliban militant organisation took responsibility for the suicide attacks that took place outside the German embassy.
Many German newspapers and pundits are looking at this attack in connection with the Al-Qaeda message.
"They are targeting Germany."
Fundamentalist Muslims are viewing the German Afghan policy in a negative and critical manner.
They accuse the German government of following an extremist policy, not only in Afghanistan, but also in the Middle East.
Because of this, they are increasingly considering Germany as a target.
In the meantime, the German government claims that the German secret agencies had knowledge about this video, even before it came to light.
The German joint crime control organisation is busy studying the video.
Obama Becomes American President
In this situation, the whole world, not just the American public, has high hopes for Obama.
As Barack Obama is receiving greetings from all over the world on becoming the president of America, the expectations from him are also rising.
In this reference, the German Chancellor Angela Merckle has expressed confidence in the American president.
I am sure that based on the friendship between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America, we can resolve all the issues faced.
Russian prime minister Viladimir Putin has said that Obama appears to a serious and open hearted man and that this is really good news.
The policies of former American president George W. Bush have been facing criticism.
However, his regime is appreciated for promoting China to play a more constructive role internationally. Whereas, China has said about the new American president will have to work for stronger military relations between both countries.
Active in the German city of Bochum, Chinese political expert Kusuay Wu says:
"In this reference, I am sure that in coming weeks and months, Obama and his team of economists will put immense pressure on China to have a more flexible and competitive to market exchange rate for the Chinese currency".
The former American regime has also improved its relations with India.
On the issue of how far Obama can take these relations, Christopher Raj, Professor of American Studies in New Delhi says, "now we have come closer in strategic partnership, however, Obama can not bring an overnight change".
In a message sent to Obama by Pope Benedict, the Pontiff also stressed the need to create an environment of peace and mutual help in the world.

According to the Urdu service of Mehr news agency, even on the 16th day of the fight between truth and falsehood in Gaza, there was beastly bombing by Israel on the city population of Gaza, by the use of air, land and naval attacks, in which 880 people have died so far.

Today, the always ready to die, Mujahids of Ajeen province, have defeated the Israeli army, with the power of faith and martyrdom, and a show of amazing forbearance and steadfastness, tightening the collar of life, around the necks of the Zionist enemies.
If it were not for the deception of Egyptian president, Hasani (not) Mubarak, the brave and loyal Hamas Mujahids would have defeated Israel a long while ago, but apart from the Israeli siege, the Egyptians have also placed Palestinian Muslims under siege, which is the saddest story of Arab history.
Here, the Saudi Arabian and Jordanian governments are giving the Israeli government political and economic support, and are helping Israel by deceiving the helpless Muslims of Gaza.

Mehr News Agency related from Associated Press that the American President George Bush, in the last press conference of his term, accepted numerous mistakes and crimes.

Upon being asked various questions about the Israeli inflictions on Gaza, President Bush said that Israel has the right to defend itself. According to him, Hamas does not have the right to defend itself and Hamas should not do anything to Israel, and like America, the whole world should choke the oppressed rather than the oppressor.

Israel is using American weapons to massacre Palestinians. and Bush also praised the Israel-supporting Arabs, calling them the friends of Israel.

Iranian President Ahmedinejad expresses sorrow over silence of Arab leaders.
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, the Iranian President Mahmood Ahmadinejad criticized the Arab leaders' silence on the Israeli inhumanity and oppression in Gaza, expressing his sorrow.
Expressing surprise over the Arab countries' and their leaders' silence over the beastly acts of Israel, President Ahmadinejad said that Israel is subjecting the Palestinian public to a holocaust, that they are making the Palestinian children, women and civilians targets of their barbarity, and that the Arab leaders have not even given one statement.
President Ahmede Nejad has called upon all the Arab countries to unite against Israel and to save the oppressed Muslims of Gaza from Israel's harm and tyranny.
Ahmade Nejad says the Saudi King should clarify his stance on the  genocide being done in Gaza by Israel.
According to the report by MAHAR/MEHR news agency, President Ahmede Nejad in his message to the Saudi King Malik Abdullah declared that the silence on the human genocide in Gaza and muteness on the murder of innocent children and women by  the Muslim King of Saudi Arabia is encouraging the enemies of Islam.
President Ahmede Nejad has said in his message: "You should show your true stance on Gaza and declare support for the oppressed, so that the enemy's efforts to plant differences in the Islamic block will fail."
President Ahmede Nejad has said in his message: "You know that for the last 19 days Israel has been bent upon human genocide, murdering innocent children, and subjecting homes, mosques, schools and hospitals to barbaric bombing. The Zonist Regime is brutally murdering the unarmed Muslims in Gaza. In situations like these, silence on the part of leaders like you is only encouraging Israel."

He says that the oppressed will win over the oppressors because that's Allah's promise.
President George Bush: Terrorism is Still a Threat to USA
MEHER/MAHAR news agency has copied from the German news agency that the US President, while addressing his successor Barak Obama and the nation in his farewell speech, said that though the US is safer than it was seven years ago, the threat of terrorism still looms over USA.
Bush said that the enemy terrorists are waiting patiently to attack America, and they have a strong determination to attack America so America should never be unaware about its security.
The American President ignored the hurts and suffering of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza, and defended his policies saying that America is still the biggest supporter of independence. However, commentators do not accept the reality of the unpopular president's remarks, as America is neither a supporter of freedom, nor a supporter of human rights, but rather it is the most mischievous country in the world, which not only supports a blood thirsty country like Israel, but is also directly involved in its crimes.
Israel openly kills children, women and civilians and the American president is congratulating them. This is the American humanity and freedom which the world is seeing in Gaza and other places.
Usama Hamdan: Presence of army in Palestine continues
According to a report by Mehr News Agency, the Hamas leader in Lebanon, Usamah Hamdan told French News Agency during an interview that the one-sided ceasefire from Israel's side is against the comprehensive international efforts for a ceasefire. He said that as long as Israel is present in Gaza, a one-sided ceasefire is meaningless.
He said that the one-sided ceasefire was an unsuccessful effort of Israel to escape defeat. Hamdan said that if Israel wants long term peace, it will have to accept Hamas's conditions as well as end this siege.
The Hamas leader in Lebanon made it clear that if Israel tries a one-sided ceasefire with its army remaining in the Gaza belt, there will be resistance against it.
Addressing a one way conference from Beirut, the Usamah Hamdan called for the European countries to break ties with Israel.
The Hamas leader said that the increasing numbers of the martyred and injured will only increase our determination.
He told the Palestinian public to stay firmly rooted and resist the enemy like a boulder.

That will be difficult, because as long as it keeps supporting the bloodthirsty Israeli government, it can not be expected to do anything good. Therefore, if America wants to save its image, it will have to stop its support of Israel and disassociate itself from Israel's crimes.

The Pakistan Muslim Leagues (n)'s leader Nawaz Sherif and Pakistan's home minister Rehman Malik met on Sunday in Raiwand in which Punjabi Chief Minister Shehbaz Sherif was also present.

Tea: A potential cure for breast cancer?
According to new research, drinking three cups of tea every day
reduced the chances of breast cancer by more than one third  in women less than 50 years old.
In research conducted by the Moffitt Cancer Center in Florida in the United States, it has been found that women less than 50 years old that have the breast cancer oncogene
reduced their chances of breast cancer by 37 percent among those who drank three cups of tea a day.
The research indicated that older women did not get any benefit from drinking three or more cups of tea a day.
The researchers think that the tea contains polyphenols that are effective against the type of oncogene in the breast cancer that affects women younger than 50.
The Moft Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, studied 5,000 women who had taken the treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 70 years.
The experts compared their medical records and lifestyle with those of women who have not been diagnosed with breast cancer.
The experts also found out that on a particular type of breast cancer called Lobular, tea had shown to prevent cancer by 66%.
Almost one in ten patients of breast cancer suffer from this type.
This type of cancer is more dangerous because it deep inside and is usually diagnosed when it has already spread to a great extent.
Experts say that by drinking at least three cups of tea a day, the danger of breast cancer can be reduced in young women.
They say that making tea a regular drink can cause great resistance in the body against breast cancer.
In Britain every year almost 40,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer.

Why Reduce Exercise With Age?
New Research
Exercise at any age is good for your health.
It energizes your heart, reduces cholesterol levels, helps in keeping weight low, helps to prevent diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer's or dementia.
Unfortunately the ability to exercise decreases for many people as they age.
Experts say that exercise keeps our body and brain active however age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise from not doing exercise.
Dr. Pattricia P. Leka of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says that increase in age is a big reason for being handicapped from exercise and other physical activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo clinic.
She headed a research study regarding heart disease and man's ability to do exercise in older age.
A team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart
in which it's activity of pumping blood and its contraction and relaxation was studied.
Researcher focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.
They came to know ,that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.
Dr. Patricia says with increase in age, problems occur in the activity of relaxation of heart and this effects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garvin Ken was also part of this research.
He says that they were surprised to see that it has an effect  and it confirmed that bad exercising ability is very much related to the heart relaxing activity.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause disorders in heart functions and heart disease.
If the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard, the patient can take advantage of the benefits of exercise regardless of age.
A detailed report on this matter is published in a magazine from the American Medical Association.
No Chances of an Immediate War with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief
Indian Army Chief General Deepak Kapoor has said that there are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan. "However/ we are always ready to defend our country and sacrifice our lives for it," he said.
He has stated that even with commitments from other nations and international pressure on Pakistan as a result of Mumbai attacks, the infrastructure of terrorism is not only existent but also proactive in Pakistan.
He said this while talking to correspondents in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day tour to the valley of Kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in New Delhi-administered Kashmir and preparation of armed forces on the borders.
He was asked his thoughts on media reports that Pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from India regarding the Mumbai attacks.
General Kapoor said that the decisions of peace or war matters are made by the political leadership.
Talking about the presence of the skeleton of terrorism on the land of Pakistan, he said allegedly, that India will fight against such circumstances and those who are ready to destroy peace and weaken India.
He said that there are around 7 to 800 fighters present on the land of Indian Kashmir from which almost 50% are foreigners.
General Deepak Kapoor said that only with the betterment in the weather, the efforts of encroachment between Pakistan and Kashmir under its government can be increased.  Although India has increased security on the borders.
They have refused the possibility of reduction in the number of army soldiers in Indian Kashmir by stating that one can't compromise over the country's security.
May God answer the world's prayers and may Barrack Obama be beneficial for the world.
Though there is not much hope, we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan are effected by this change.
That what will be what Mr. Barrack Obama gives to the world in the name of Martin Luther King's dreams.
The oath taking of Obama as the President of America, whose part of the name is also Hussain, is where historically important in all the ways, is also a great challenge for the history.
Not only for his own self but also for those who supported him with all their hearts.
This challenge will also be for the white majority as it's not easy for them to accept that a colored man is ruling over them.
Here in South Asia, Muslims who have expectations from him, should remember that he has been elected as the President of the United States. And Obama should remember that being President of the United States actually means being the President of the entire world.
A man whose brothers and sisters were brought to America as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, this will be a win for the people who love him.
What will be its effect on South Asia, and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan?

Whether it is by Obama or some one else, the policy of the entire world is done by Jews who lobby billionaires and influence powerful and effective people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts, the offensive reactions of India, America and Israel are in front of everyone.
Even for a while, after Pakistan was formed, the managing of Swat was left to the Ruler of Swat, which had its own army and law.
They surrendered their rule to the government of Pakistan according to a treaty.
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a stepmother.
There has been no increase in the number of schools in Swat, since the rule of the Ruler of Swat was finished.
Nor was there any interest in construction and development over there.
The number of girls receiving education in the present rule is many times less than their number in the previous rule.
In the Sarhad state of Pakistan, the local Taliban have been targeting the educational institutions.
The most schools were destroyed in Swat province, of which the majority were girls' schools.
Not only this, but the Taliban have announced the prohibition of girls' education in Swat.
Thousands of male and female students are being deprived of education.
what do you think, by stopping girls' education, thatthe Taliban want to achieve?
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities so far?
what do you think the government should do?
The question should be that what ISI and Pakistani Agencies will get as a result?
because the people of Swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them, otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that even during the Curfew. How can people be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing?
When the writ of the government is not being let implemented, how can the government succeed in stopping these illegal activities?
Now the question arises that having an armed force, armed with modern weapons, modern technologies and intelligence systems, why the government can not control these few Taliban.
The only answer is that there is a hidden hand over their head, that neither their arms can reach nor they are apprehended.
The result of the discussion is that the Taliban with their wrong steps are making it easier for the imperialists.
Fifteen years before the war was being continued in Afghanistan.
ISI used to control the Taliban when there was the opposition from the Northern Alliance, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then, suddenly, the situation changed and the Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of money from America, so the former friend became an enemy.
Now the situation has changed, but the war is still going on and those supporting them in Pakistan are still Russia, India and Iran.
Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.
For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play God with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings
The question is whether war, armed resistance and terrorism are the solutions to the problem?
If not, then what is the magic recipe that will bring about a solution to the problem?
It is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but adds 'blessings' to them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development that Nelson Mandela used in South Africa.
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
After the Kashmiris took part in the elections, it appears that they have accepted this point of view.
We are in  the third week of Israeli attacks on Gaza and the number of deaths have risen to close to a thousand.
To date, a ceasefire was not possible despite worldwide diplomatic efforts.
According to another report, since the attacks began on December 27, 90,000 Palestinians have left their homes and moved to a safer location.
Aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, saying that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victims of severe psychological and emotional problems.
What are you saying?
What should happen next?
How can we maintain permanent peace in Gaza?

Give Taliban a Chance.
Basit, Peshawar
Wake up! If Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down girls schools?
They will be kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
These Taliban have damaged Islam so much that no other nation or religion has done.
Pashtoon Rore
Kohat, Pakistan
If the whole Muslim world just gave a joint threat to attack Israel, you will see how upset will father America will be.
And immediately not only talks on ceasefire but ceasefire will really happen as well.
But what can be done? Where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from?
Someone tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step, as he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
The responsibility of peace and human rights not only lies on Arab and the Muslim worlds but its the obligation of the whole world to raise their voice against tyranny.
This unfortunate incident is Bush's worst sin so far.
Just like in Pakistan and India before 30th June or the end of the fiscal year, the government institutions are looted, the American regime just before its end have given a green signal to Israel to do what ever it wants.
On one hand America says that effort will be made for ceasefire.
On the other hand, the United Nations is passing resolution after resolution, but action-wise, has done nothing. There is only one meaning of this, and that is that the even the United Nations is openly in favor of destroying the Muslims.
All Muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the United Nations, and should establish their own global organization.
We have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations are seen, but the harm is only done to the Muslims.
What is the use of these vain efforts if BBC does not want to publish anything?
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically of Muslims, is spilled, the monster of unbiasedness gets onto BBC's back.
It considers itself the standard bearer of truth.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments from Muslims.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments from Muslims.
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, and the likes of you stay among Muslims, and call yourselves Muslims.
[syja786]
For a long time on BBC forums, sometimes suicide bombing and terrorism in India was used to target a certain sect.
The favorite word of these Anti-Islamic discussions was "Extremism".
You can get a very good idea about who an extremist is from the above discussion, where writing against Iran was almost considered blasphemy.
When will our muslims understand that Anti Christ can not be fought with swords?
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what can one do other than cry?
But the basic fault is that by naming the source of this turmoil and massacre Jihad, we try to blacken the beautiful face of Islam.
When the majority of Palestinians accepted the existence of Israel, then why did Hammas need to fire those rockets on Israel and conduct suicide attacks?
The attitude of the both the sides is against humanity.
The role of UN and the USA was again seen as favoring towards the injustice of Israel.
May Allah give the muslim nation the understanding of becoming united. Amen!
The real terrorists should be given the noble prize for this painful movement against terrorism. After all, they are doing the real work.
This large scale terrorism would not be possible without the support of some big feudal and everyone knows who those controllers are.
so in this situation, in common terms it is called DADAGEERI which means do what ever you can.
That it even hits you hard on the head and does not even let you cry.
There are medicines for injured, and coffins for the dead. They are being supplied by the Arab leaders.
Should the Israeli attacks take place?
This is the actual problem that the leaders of Muslim countries including Saudi crownprince are in a false sleep, neither they have an army nor any plan for defense and just by providing aid they think they have fulfilled their responsibilities.
They should take immediate measures against Israel.
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Salam to all brothers and sisters!
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is similar to considering them defeated.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature. The steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Israel and Hamas should enter a truce so that the death and destruction can come to an end.
Mohammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France
Absolutely correctly stated
Supposing that Hamas is 100% on the truth, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah. Even then, they should know that if a good deed is resulting in the destruction of an established house, it is no more a good deed.
Those who claim to love God, love the messenger and love their religion. Loving mankind is a part of their faith.
As if it is the order of Allah to evacuate all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than the Muslims.
Najibur Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI@N]
There are no orders to destroy but there are invites for them to come to Islam.
Jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion.
These people should be fought against unless they stop these conspiracies. This doesn't mean that one should wear a jacket and blast himself at a gathering.
The only end to the killer of innocent children is destruction.
I ask my friends about the Israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past. They have become so strong today that they don't listen to any one. This is because the Jews are united.
There are no Sheas and Sunnis. There are all just Jews and they have developed everything in every field.
What is the condition of 55 Islamic countries?
They are behind in every field and they have become so helpless that the enemies are killing them and they are waiting for the death.
it is essential that all Muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan.
There is no better course of action than accepting Israel. They could learn new technology and ways of success from them, and also let the world live in peace.
Muslims have great land and resources.
The need is correct usage.
First of all, the most tragic part is that Hammas and Alfatah could not be united.
The only reason to destroy great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin was to weaken the only nation fighting for the Aqsa Mosque; and it was impossible until Yasir and Yasin were eliminated.
The world was watching that Palestine was falling down every second after the death of these two leaders.
..., and how this lobby of Jews strengthened their target by every moment.
In 1974, a Pakistani Prime minister was in such world power that he led all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100% attendance for the first time in history.
Today, on his 81st birthday, is it hard for this nation to make a promise to whether or not it will be able to unite itself.
While eradicating the differences between other Muslims, the formation of an Islamic common wealth will be carried forward.
It is a monster that has gripped Palestine for half a century.
This monster has many faces.
Many times, this monster criticizes itself from its own different mouth to divert the pressure and attention of the world.
Its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
This monster is most unhappy with Islam, because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out it will be through Islam. Muslims and the perfect religion of practical Islam, have put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
Bombing from Israeli fighter planes on Gaza has continued  since the 27th of December.
More than three hundred Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
After the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
Through a unanimous resolution in an emergency meeting of the security council, the United Nations has demanded Israel and the Palestinian authorities to ceasefire.
However, the Israeli authorities say they will continue operation in Gaza until they make sure the rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
In your opinion, is this claim by Israel true?  Is Israel  doing all this to defend its own sovereignty?
Is the world community doing enough in this situation?
Does this aggression have any relation to the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can any improvement be expected in the situation in the middle east after the newly elected American president Barak Obama takes office?

BBC publishes these kind of comments after deep search.
A neutral impression is to be maintained.
Although the news from BBC is usually correct, the real thing is the style of the news.
It is sometimes difficult to decide what should be highlighted and what news should be given less importance.
etc. etc.
Zaheer Chughtai
In the Pakistani electronic and print media, some Urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone, and cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the "grudge of Muavia" written on them.
has said that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. how long this hypocrisy will continue.
Why there is so much atrocity committed on Muslims. If people like Americans are backing up the Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So, Americans, if you have courage then stop supporting them and see then what their fate is.
So-called writers and murderers in name of peace should understand that peace in the world can only be obtained through justice not through genocide.
If any nations perish through genocide and results of choice can be obtained then after actions of Hitler, existence of Jews and their uprising was impossible.
As poet says.
Atrocity is atrocity, it vanishes when it rises.
Blood is blood, clots when drop.
Now who will tell whom what is terrorism?
Is this comes in terrorism, why? because own pain is only felt.
Other people are not humans or blood of Muslims is so cheap or color of these innocents' blood was not red?
And now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere?
I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.
I see dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood. How shall we condemn? I can not find words!
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims. On one side people are being killed in India so the rest of the world comes over to Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations that we will do it ourselves!
On the other side, Israel is killing generations of Muslims in front of everyone and the world is silent. This is unbearable!
There is delay but not ever in the house of God. Only then will this darkness shed.
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
Considering elections, the rulers should these activities for people's support. There is no doubt in this, especially when countries like Israel exist. Rest talking about Barrack Obama, then history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy. Regime, whether black or white, is a regime.
The debate going on in the forum makes it clear that every one is sad on Benazir's death. As a politician, one can not ignore her mistakes.
This talk requires debate on whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If democracy was so dear, then  why was it left in 10 year dictatorship of Musharaf until American clearance and the deal?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the public needed her, but she came at a time when her acquittal from her cases and her supremacy was promised.
When each and every historic figure is being accused, there is no one to say any thing over this.
Sana Khan
Few things are ignored by thinking that nothing can be done about them.

Sir, maybe you should not only study Pakistan's history but that of 4 friends and 7 other countries, then maybe you would agree with Psycho's point of view.

Living green in the water made the reflection of the wheat plant look like a cypress.
Britain never let them unite, which established the Hindu-Muslim conflict later brought on by Sir Syed.
Psycho
How merciless is our nation? We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party. Now, when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.
We have succeeded a lot!
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored. We are thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar, if you en wreathe him with books.
Although the ongoing talks between Pakistan and India were interrupted after the Bombay attacks, Pakistan and India should continue these meetings.
If they talk about war, then both the sides will suffer human loss.
India says that a Pakistani citizen was caught in the Bombay attacks. He has written and sent a letter in Urdu to Pakistan. Earlier, when India caught this extremist, they say he is a smart engineer but later they declared him to have studied only four grades. All this should be considered.
First of all, Merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and all our Christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
We do not want the flames of fire; but the flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
Will war give a solution to our problems?
It will be blessed with fire and blood.
It will give hunger and exigence.
Therefore wise humans
It's better to avoid war.
In our yard.
It's better that the glim keeps lightened
The India-America relations have deepened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
This is also the old history of America.
In case of an Indian attack, America would make its goals and the expense would be on India as well.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that says we will not attack first, but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation and ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied, even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
This is Islamic history.
Even before this resolution, the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it clearer and that is why, in contrast to the initial strict reaction, the world community has relaxed its pressure now.
While ignoring India's unnecessary bobbery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a "Side Effect" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
There are no two opinions over this. It is a heinous act.
But the question is this- when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past year?
How many Taliban are killed by thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday?
I appeal to the I.S.I, that for God's sake, stop monitoring the Taliban and let us live in peace in our heavenly hometown Sawat.
And stop this phony operation.
The day is not far when a resolution about Pakistan's military intervention will be passed by United Nations, just like the bill which was passed against Jamat-ud-Dawah.
Riaz Ahmad Farooqi
The extremists of our country and their supporters themselves are constantly providing all evidences and justifications required for instigation of action against them, and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is passed, in all likelihood, not a single voice would be raised in United Nations, in our favor.
And supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.
We are not aware and familiar with the character and achievements of Pir Sami-ullah and what his activities were.
Maybe he was not a revolutionist.
Like the dead bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, Doctor Najeebullah and thousands of other revolutionists have been subjected to dishonor at the hands of the enemy.
They are deathless even after being dead.
But here, an international game is being played. Here ferociousness  and animosity are created to do the ruling.
So there can be reasons created. That if we are not here then these vandals and animals can come take over the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
America sees the torture of these extremists, but instead of being sad on these faithless activities, they easily name them as tribal culture.
The reason for these faithless activities, sometimes given in the name of tribal culture and other times in the name of Islam, is not something done by a person with a heart.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
That is because when they change destination, it takes time. But to catch them, forget about getting there on time, even if they are on the spot, they leave from there.
Are they so brave that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also men of God and so is our army.
It is very clear that there is something fishy.
Instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and punitive occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion, was seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell!
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said, that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose not to know about it.
Who burnt the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on her refusal of oath after the Prophet (PB-UH) passed away and who took her husband's life with the rope in his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
Was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
Motives cannot be diminished and correcion cannot be made without accepting reality.
O' BBC please stop this dual-headed policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
A human was pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office?  Please show some modesty.
the success of Operation Sherdil and Operation Lion Heart across the border depends on who is in the favor of public opinion.
This is an act of American and Pakistani agencies and Peer.  Sahab is a victim of this conspiracy.
Now that secret agens have successfully joined the Taliban and they are doign what the can to change public opinion, all discussions on this forum will now be anti Taliban.
I only want to ask, when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public? They even report something like this: "Bombing of Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother".
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000 in Swat went there to do.
The bodies of the Taliban who help the army are left hanging on poles throughout the day.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake, stop this drama.
These Taliban members have tarnished the Muslim image.
If, around the world, true Muslims don't call these terrorists Muslims, then why are these elements able to live in the lands of true Muslims?
Those who become shameless can't do hard labor, and they pick up guns and become the members of terrorist groups.
Islam did not spread on the point of a sword or barrel of a gun.
Feel the shame.
No religion or family tradition allows this.
All the media, incl present their views on the Taliban or the tribal people in different styles.
No one, other than us tribal people, are aware of the ground realities, what the truth is, and what really is the matter.
In short, it's a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD and our own ISI are invloved. No one is a Talib or a tribal. Warmongers, who are against Islam, Taliban, Madrassa's, Pushtoon people, tribes and tribal traditions, made these institutions.
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute the leader of MQM, Althaf Husain, and the leaderships of ANP and PPP, as they have spoken against this cancer, i.e. the Taliban.
This cancer was given birth to by Zia-ul-Haqq. He has gone, but he  destroyed Pakistan as he went.
But I have hope that the present government will eradicate this cancer.
After the Mumbai attacks, India said that a few extremist groups are involved in such attacks. 
Pakistan has denied charges and said that India in the investigation will provide all possible help. 
India said they have provided Pakistan a list of 20 extremists who are wanted in India. 
Pakistan said that leader of Jaish e Muhammad, Maulana Masud Azhar, included in this list has not been detained and the Pakistani government has no information about him. 
Previously, president Asif Ali Zardari has denied the allegations that western intelligence agencies and Indian government have provided Pakistan the proof of Mumbai attacks. 
President Zardari said that it is not yet proven that Ajmal Qasab is Pakistani. 
During this, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that the its relations with India are not going to improve if its land continues to be used for terrorism.
And in the latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should sports be affected due to these political events?
What future to you see for the India-Pakistan relationship?
Neither America nor India could break Pakistan.
Pakistan could only be broken by the Pakistanis themselves.
What do you expect after such regionalism, communalism. and vandalism?
Even Jinnah, too, did not do good for the Muslims of India. Time has proved this.
Yasmin, Chicago
Madam, if we had kept working on the vision of Jinnah, the cancer of Communalism, Regionalism and Vandalism would not have spread in Pakistan. And also the Muslims of India would not have been treated this way.
It's our fault that we could not bring up a leader of his stature.
If we can not care for our heroes, then
this region has great capabilities.
God knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
In both countries, enemies of peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv sena, RSS have been raised.
The evil powers don't want this region to progress, therefore these countries are controlled like puppets.
Can you imagine what status this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world?
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
May Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
But sir, open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and reality on the ground, and you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
Moreover, the internal affairs don't seem to be good, as you can see the circumstances in NWFP, Balochistan and in Karachi in Sindh.
In this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
Oh Allah, bestow your mercy upon us.
According to my understanding, a final war is inevitable.
This is enough of it.
Now it should be do or die.
This problem can not be solved through these acts of insincere dialogues.
And not through small scale terrorism in each other's country.
After all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
And if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all of our political parties agree on this matter: these terrorist and denominational activities should be terminated from the country.
But our army rule does not seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, American and Europe are made to believe that we are with you on this war against terrorism, and the other hand, we also help Taliban secretly.
We have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way. Thank you.
There is no doubt in this that the majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are the members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined  the party  named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.
Although these members preferred subsidiary activities and are now after India's great persistence, The United Nation has invalidated it also and Government of Pakistan is continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it would be better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
Terrorist groups present in Pakistan, who support professional criminals and the heads of those Mullahs are those who call Pakistan the land of destruction.
And now they are doing everything to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called Human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan from these evil-doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to wonder whether we should ban these mutinous people or not?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose work is only to kill.
This news breaks my heart to pieces.
What kind of world is this where it is hard to live for one who takes the name of one major pillar of Islam,  religion of Allah.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims but when Muslims even try to take revenge, all our hypocrite leaders together with all the non-Muslim world treat people with the true and right pain of religion just like our great leader Hafiz Saeed is being treated today.
India in impunity of Bombay attacks.
Pakistan relations are bitter. The better relationship as a result of last few years between the two countries have been jolted greatly.
India has always held the military and non-military groups in Pakistan responsible.
And putting the relationship back on track is being conditioned by operations against these groups.
Indian security departments have held Lashkher-e-Tayyaba responsible for the Bombay attacks.
In this case, the name of Jamat-ud-Dawa has come to the forefront many times.
This is the first time that relationship between both the countries has worsened due to terrorist activity in India.
In December 2001, after the attacks on the Indian Parliament, these two neighbors were on the brink of war.
After that, in 2002 Lashker-e-Tayyaba was banned and included in the list of terrorists.
Now it is about Jamat-ud-Dawa, which Security analysts say that is in reality a new face of Lashker-e-Tayyaba. Restrictions on the party are being requested.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan conduct decisive operations against extreme activists on its land?
By banning Jamat-ud-Dawa, can  the current Pak-India crisis be brought to a close?
And how important is it to close down the armed groups to keep constant peace between both countries?
The Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all, what proof does the Security Council have to decide this so quickly?
Does the Security Council always show urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful country.
Whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours? India. And they want to put the blame for it's inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis, continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Salam, please do it with pleasure, but act at your own discretion.
Do not do it under American pressure.
If India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
Why does it accuse us of every thing?
As there are extremist groups and organizations in India, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the world?
What is India doing in Kashmir?
What is Israel doing?
The truth is that we are the first nuclear Muslim state, and this is the main issue.
Pakistan is in its last stage.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart and circumstances also seems to be such
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all of these sanctions seem to be part of this conspiracy.
Americans are now not slowly but very swiftly tightening their grip over Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances,if we as a nation do not display unity and solidarity and if Bangladesh can be created, then anything can happen.
The more terrorism is condemned the lesser it is , whether it is in a Hotel at Mumbai, in Marriott Hotel Islamabad or in Palestine.
Likewise irrespective of the origin of the terrorist, they should be eliminated, no matter these are Pakistanis or Indian or American or Israelite.
Now the question remains why the whole world, including the Pakistani officials, is silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack carried out on Marriott Hotel not committed by terrorists?
then why
Hale to the advisor for interior Rehman Malik! How brave and bold has the gentleman become!
no image
not only this, but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under 'someones's pressure'.
Wow, all praise to the Almighty!
Whether having the ability or not or to say what I do not want.
We, the Pakistanis are fighting who's war?
We have our own interests that we shall do our best to protect.
No one has  a right to interfere with anyone's national affairs.
The colonial system is apparently not there.
If people expect justice, demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan. I do not believe this is acceptable by those calling for unity.
As such, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
And this causes more feelings of opposition.
If they trust America and the United republics, then let them leave the style of new populations, and let them work on those lines, upholding the sovereignty of the state.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
In Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, security forces captured a proved camp of practically non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India's accusation is that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice told the Pakistani leadership that there should be immediate action taken against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack.
She says that the extremists responsible for the attacks in Mumbai undoubtedly used Pakistan as a base. 
During this, the Peshawar Government says that unknown armed persons set another convoy of goods for Allied Forces deployed in Afghanistan on fire, destroying more than 50 vehicles. 
It is the second attack on Nato and American supplies in Peshawar in 48 hours. 
Attempts made prior to the raid to disarm the  groups of Laskkr e Taiba from Karachi to the Tribal areas were unsuccessful despite offers of rewards for surrendering weapons and promises of immunity. 
It is revealed that during the reign of General Zia ul Huq because of the invasion of the ex USSR in Afghanistan and its resistance started by the American and Saudi funding resulted in the birth of armed groups of which Pakistan unable to terminated could not get back herself to the era before 1980s. 
The question is, does Pakistan want to do it? 
Is Pakistan capable of doing this? 
What do you think?

I ask only one question from flag holders of humanity.
If you kill their children and they bring necklace for you, this is impossible.
Saeed, Multan.
And question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies, say any logic, argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men, laborers and poor workers of different occupations, in revenge of American attack?
If the answer is no, then you have instant need of correcting your point of view.
People were armed, at that time it was dangerous that Russia will turn toward Pakistan after Afghanistan, therefore people were armed.
Now when there is danger that America will overrun Pakistan through passage of Afghanistan of which American president had said out in his election campaign then why should we unarm these people?
Only because America or India army don't have to face any civil resistance after defeating Pakistani army?
Yes, if anyone of them is involved in any destructive actions then Pakistan should act against them.
It is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved, proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it's still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
Another question is that were these terrorists supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or trained in Pakistan, and not any other country in the world?
As for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the present terrorism is in no way connected to it.
It must be remembered that Hafiz Saeed is the first 'Jehadi leader' who called the Taliban actions 'mischief'.
I'm sure that the Taliban effect is a inseparable result of American plans, and hence every person who can stand in the way of the Taliban must be removed.
Despite the support of the whole nation, the fact that Zardari and co. took action against the Lashkar is a clear sign of their frigid and kiss-up nature.
To stop the project that is running on Saudi-American funding, they must be requested themselves to regather the filth that has polluted our society.
We should also protest against them, because in their opinion, America and Saudi Arabia distributed dangerous weapons and announced Jihad but in reality, spread the virus of hateful literature and culture, which caused slaughter houses to open in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, with the announcement that the Pakistani Army will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan and the announcement of the Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly. And tried its' best to get India to attack Pakistan.
This shattered the confidence of America in the area.
Although India did not even threaten nor does it have the guts to.
And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of the Taliban on American posts.
Thus it was proven that without the support of Pakistan and its' army, America can not do anything.
Karachi is Pakistan's business and economic center, and Dubai of the less privileged areas.
Hundreds of thousands do not return empty-handed from here. But since the law was enforced on the western borders, Karachi has taken all the attention.
Now they are looking to kidnap this city.
For the first time Pathan's are called Pashtoons. They are made to fight by making them strangers to each other, although the need is to be united.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speaking learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu. It's better that everybody learns English.
You must be thinking it's a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also amusing?
That the cause of the torture would be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir in my childhood I had actually gave the same suggestion many times to my friends which included people from every religion and rhetoric groups, but these people used to laugh over these suggestions.
At that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not as apparently alive and powerful on the surface but they were boiling inside.
It's hard to understand what is happening and why.
Are these the signs of the Judgement Day?
What are these innocent and obnoxious people being killed for?
The reason is in front of everyone: the ones who want to break Pakistan into pieces are active and those who do all this neither belong to any one religion nor a country.
Whether it is Karachi or Bombay, our homes are burnt with their own lamps (we have destroyed our homes ourselves.)
When the government comes, they just change names of the places to build a name for themselves. Just like these days airports, roads, buildings are all named Benazir.
What has happened in Karachi, is this what Benazir means?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of the RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
Unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awakened sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
Where reactions full of patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties have taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time they have also given American planners one more chance to think.
MQM and ANP are responsible for the turmoil in Karachi and management is showing self interest.
Management can control the situation in one hour but it is being given wind on purpose.
Pressure of political parties on police and rangers keep them from doing the operation.
Talk of getting united are only limited to statements, political parties should let go of their self interests and work for the interest of a common man.
These kinds of incidents will keep taking place until there is pressure on the administration.
I think that these people are the biggest terrorists.
Foreign powers are definitely involved in this, but no one knows who they are.
But alas, that if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there, but since its not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
The government should operate here and save one of this country's largest and most important cities from terrorism
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
Also, BBC Urdu is not writing the truth under pressure-- Pakistani media's condition is already weak.
The whole truth is there on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that either Urdu speakers should learn Pushto or Pushto speaking learn Urdu. The best solution would be if every body could learn English.
You will definitely take this as a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
Language may be the reason for persecution.
Another story of murder, long dreaded by all the citizens has finally been published in Karachi.
The criminals seize any opportunity to commit a crime. The media are only telling 50% of what actually happened here in 4 days.
Citizens have spent three sleepless nights. Clearly the fear is still present.
Those who make the people evacuate hotels, those who kill the shoe-makers and the peanut-sellers.
Those who rob and kill at the Super Highway, and cut off the ears of innocent citizens are ignorant of the wrath of Allah which will eventually entrap them.
In your opinion, what is the cause of this sudden turmoil?
(B.B.C)
In light of the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai, we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the cause of the disorder in Karachi. It seems that the turmoil is due to an unconscious trade of blood.
Obviously if someone infuriates the father, it would not be surprising for the son to react violently.
The blood of the loyalists of Liaqat Ali Khan also belonged to the same place. To eliminate Mr. Psycho's misunderstanding I am writing this verse.
We will also repeat our elders' traditions.
We made it by sacrificing lives and will save it by doing the same.
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
it is very disappointing that whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
See Liaqat Ali Khan and you will will find out that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family from Karnal in Punjab.
Due to his steps for the migrants, today the migrants consider him as one of them.
There is always a reaction to every action.
One can afford on oneself but.
Ejaz Aiwan
Before you gather a huge crowd quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.
These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan. They did not face any reaction.
On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.
One Muslim League N was left. Even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to the People's Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q have made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment to the National Assembly and the Senate.
Till now, it seems that the drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment. They also did not force the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part. They will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft and that the government speaker did not take any action.
MQM is the government in power, Muslim League N in the opposition and Muslim League Q the party who passed the 17th amendment; how is it possible that these parties will be sincere in finishing the 17th amendment?
This is what is called getting credit for nothing.
The people's party is already tardy about finishing the 17th amendment.
How can someone think of cutting off their own hands?
The 17th amendment will not be canceled until Zardari is the President.
This was the opinion of the majority in our survey and it is also true.
If the 17th amendment was to be discarded, then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf. Because by supporting the president, he became the chairman of the People's Party.
The 17th amendment is valid until he is the president.
In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to bid Zardari farewell from the presidential house.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
Most of the elders from our family belonged to the labor community.
In our childhood, when we used to see our uncles doing labor work, we used to pray to Allah to save us from this hard work.
To avoid this, we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what we should we do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor work.
The editor wrote in reply that we should select certain subjects and become doctors or engineers.
Right from beginning, my trend was towards engineering. I had selected technical drawing instead of Biology as well.
But at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.
I studied biology for a month and then took math as an alternate subject when nothing worked out.
The fear of labor work made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than other in my family, for which I am always thankful to God.
I remembered that when my two sons and I were trying to remove the carpets from our old house.
We were not even thirty minutes into our working that our younger son said “Dad, it feels like I am not born for this job."" 
We said that if that is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor. 
Our younger son started saying, ""I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work."" 
The three of us somehow managed to finish the job and get back home. 
It means that when a man decides the destination, no matter what the motives were behind this, no one can stop him from getting it. 
But if you don’t even know what you have to do, then God be with you. 
It is said that do not say bad about the dead. But what shall we do, we see only bad things in Benazir even on her first death anniversary.
Benazir, for her selfish purpose, crushed the independence movement of the Sikhs after giving the list of their names who were fighting for freedom on one hand and on the other gave India the chance to keep its full attention on Kashmir after them helping to suppress Punjab Movement.
Tug of war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history, which has pushed the country back many years.
Benazir continued to give negative comments on Kashmir and the nuclear program after being exiled.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
During her rule, Benazir gave a free hand to her husband to make money. That is why he is known as "Mr. Ten Percent".
During Benazir's rule his brother got killed, but his murderers are still safe from any punishment.
Although she was a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
Just as Benazir conducted her politics over her father's dead body, similarly her widower is doing the same over her dead body.
Benazir came into power twice, but she could not punish the culprits of her father's political murder. Even she couldn't register a case against them.
It has been 37 years since East Pakistan separated from us, but look at the extreme of senselessness of our people and leaders that we never celebrate the mourning day.
What should have happened instead is that we should have celebrated December 16 as a didactic day and take measures to ensure that this kind of incident doesn't happen again.
On this day, we can send greetings to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again.
The rulers would reopen the Hamudur Rehman commission reports and discuss the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
They used to make arrangements to bring back the Biharis trapped in Bangladesh and send them presents to raise their spirits.
But we lack feelings now. We are not even aware if someone dies in our neighborhood.
We do not care about our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines of life from one day to the next.
If only East and West Pakistan could be one together just as East and West Germany were united once again.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not seem likely to be granted in the near future.
It was announced in the news today that the Governor of the American State Illinois had been arrested on corruption charges.
When the State Congress started getting ready to remove him from the position of governor as soon as possible, there was one American companion of ours who keeps a close watch on the circumstances of Pakistan, who boastfully claimed to us that this is what we call democracy.
In America, even the higher level people are not above the law.
And there is your country, whose president was made after he had the corruption charges dropped.
We felt our nerve of wit and said  "What if a governor was arrested in America?" In our Pakistan, our prime minister was arrested during the night and was then hanged. The other time was exiled.
Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
Pakistan awarded the guard of honor and bid farewell from the president's house, who broke the law of the country. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
The Chief Justice of Pakistan was laid off in such a way that even after the nation's support, he has yet not reinstated. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
In Pakistan, a fake degree holder was appointed as Health Minister, Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
After listening to this, the poor American could not stop laughing, and also accepted defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by Americans from all sides.
It seems from his smile
...that America is with his government. But, he is forgetting that last year the same people were with Parvez Musharaf.
The picture looks like a picture of family.
Before that one no picture had been published in which the President is seen with 3 high ranking Americans.
It looks like American activities have increased in Pakistan and one or more authorities are working with them. They might not believe the second person as opposed to the first one.
It might be possible that they have planned this also. Keep in mind the nature of the promise President Zardari fulfilled.
If any politician in the picture was thinking of how people would view this, they would not be smiling. Instead his face should show some embarrassment.
If democratic principles are applied to this picture then you will notice President Zardari is in the minority.
According to democratic principles, majority rules and who that majority is can be seen in this picture.
Heaven like Swat of Pakistan is also known as Switzerland.
Even now, according to government policy, cross talks continue along side the use of force.
But the use of force is resulting in increased support and sympathy for the Taliban among people not receiving any benefit from it.
The government must, instead of using the power, eliminate the causes of the issue.
by eliminating the causes, Fazlullah and Taliban will automatically disperse.
the Sharia bill proposed by ANP will, to a great extent, become the solution of the problems of Swat.
But besides implementation of the Sharia, the government will have to give more attention to the economical issues.
At the beginning of General Musharaf rise, it looked like the nation had rid itself of the incompetent politicians, but the lust for power changed all his plans.
all the hopes were from the participation in the "War of terror", he had started considering himself immortal.
those steps which were expected, all broke-off.
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, made a deal with the thieves.
Even then General Musharaf could control the Army but never know what wass happening to the present government.
Either its Bajor or Swat, the army does not control terror but bombs the ""Enemy"" public; along with loss of lives and wealth if you make the enemy a mentally sick, then aren't we the Enemy.
In Swat, the strongly affected part of Sarhad state, despite the continuity of military action for over one year, the situation is still going from bad to worse.
On one side, the government is only reiterating the passing of a reproachful resolution in the national assembly. On the other side, the Taliban's illegal radio FM channel is having much more influence in the region.
On the third side, the common man considers it safest to listen to the one who actually has control over the region.
During the action of the security forces, there were claims of destroying the fundamentalists by the bombing of gun ship helicopters and cannon houses, but despite these destructions, the Taliban only became more powerful, and according to an estimation, their control over Swat increased that much more.
As a result, on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat, and on the other hand the Taliban is getting stronger.
Who are stuck in between? The poor civilians.
It is said in Swat, that someone asked what kind of people the Taliban were, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of Allah and the religion'.
Then he asked how the army was, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are the protectors of the country and they fight against the enemies of the country'.
He then asked who the enemies of the religion and the country were, so he got the answer, 'We civilians'.
I am wondering how the Pakistani Army will fight the Indian Army, when they couldn't control a small faction of the Taliban.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban. Though I believe it was very easy to do.
Still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
After the girls schools, boys schools were being destroyed.
Curfews are called so that the Taliban can move around easily.
During curfew tonight, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
The question arises as to how they got there despite the curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone explain to the army how to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the Army can defeat any enemy.
You say that mostly blood is spilled in the world because of religion. Tell me if today, there were no religion, would all this killing not take place?
Are the Punjabi, Pathan, White, Black, Mahsood and other tribes the result of religion?
No! No way! Sir, religion is what teaches that no one is black or white, punjabi or muhajir. Otherwise, if religion was not present then half world would have vanished for the war between white and black and other half fighting over the status and sect.
Actually, religion gives moral teachings to the man. And binds him that he is not here on his own choice but the creator of the universe has sent him here. And he should spend his life according to his rules.
As a Muslim, I have total faith that Islam is a complete way of life and a true religion.
After living in London, for many years I used to ask wellness of my family over the telephone every morning, although many did not even call once to find out how we were. It was then I realized that they do not even tolerate our phone calls so we stopped calling.
Living here in France for the last two years, I have also felt the same thing.
I do not know why people expect us to call.
A resolution passed about Iraq in a few hours, Darfar has absolutely no problem in sending peace army.
Bombay attacks were condemned in no time and banning dubious groups is only a matter of a few hours.
And where death is dancing, we are doing consensus.
O caretakers of international peace, life is finishing here!
Is it for real that every one is waiting for it to end?
So that no other victim will even think about using a great damage causing weapon like a gun to fight for his rights?
Doesn't your heart ache whenever a father runs holding his son's dead body?
If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
But you are a shame to humanity.
At least it was proven that this area was Israel's country for thousands of years.
What should happen is that both the nations should live together happily and with love. But since they are controlled by either west or arab countries,  peace therefore,  cannot be formed here without their consent.
But even Iran wants to fight its proxy war right now.
Even if operations in Israel are halted for the time being, they will start again after another incident.
The interest of BBC's country is subject to the bestowing of America and Israel. And this is the reason why in the name of ""enlightenment"", they have come with a series of blogs based on ""darkness"" and doing one-way and a blind propaganda.
BBC is only completing a formality, and its goal and intent is to gather well wishes.
I request the moderator to publish this comment of Fidwi, so it be known that at least a little bit of affinity towards truth is still remaining in BBC
Thank You.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, Dracula's have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
How could I not feel that whatever is happening is presenting a very ugly picture of mankind.
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time, including Derah Gahzi Khan, summer showers are taking place throughout the country.
Enjoy the weather along with this poem related to it.
The rains are present.
If it rains, it is spring.
If it stays, then it is peace.
Sometimes, it comes without a reason.
At times, it spreads over day and night
Sometimes, it is very noisy, and sometimes it is very quiet.
The rains are present.
in a memory, at a night
to a buried ash
Sometimes the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burned itself.
Sometimes each drop seems sorrowful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What it means to them is whether the country lasts or not.
Whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them.
Our media is corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday afternoon something surprising happened.
Police are running here and there, but don't ask about illegal parking.
What's more, NYPD traffic was not able to look at illegally parked vehicles.
Something like this happened, when a plane of US Air really became a ship and landed in the Hudson river.
Until now, we only thought that terrorists are of the descendants of geese.
Yesterday was perhaps historically cold in New York.
The temperature does not fall this much.
Even my jaw started hurting from my half an hour walk outside.
Imagine how the people who jumped from the plane into the river would have felt.
It is a matter of luck that all people were safe.
And it was sad that the company's plane sunk during this financial crisis.
I went by the West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I still do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, during my one-hour trip the way had opened at least a bit, so I was able to use the 56th street exit.
When I saw the lines waiting at them, I had not taken the previous two exits.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women.
Shaguftah: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak, to you too.
Sarah: I have slaughtered two chickens and how they are slaughtered and Jahanzeb has already mentioned how I did it.
Apart from this, there is no other way to do it.
At this farm one has to get his own meat done, including removing the skin.
Basim.net might take some time to repair.
What happened on the forum?

The snow will vanish.
We unnecessarily kept thinking of these Taliban of S.W.A.T. as indelicate and were only unhappy over female education.
They kept expressing their grief by demolishing an all-women school and college somewhere every day.
Just like other ideas, this idea did not also come true.  According to this report by CNN, today on the sacred day of Monday this Taliban gang of S.W.A.T. have blasted an all-boys school.
Swat: The Taliban has destroyed a boys' school.
The girls' schools were already destroyed, according to the famous English saying "Ladies First". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusations against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, says Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujaheddin more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Amen, then Amen.
Masha Allah, up till now, 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom, among Muslims, of fixing marriages before birth, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement made by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See a picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
Just before this, the wedding between a dog and a girl took place.
Look at that groom.
Humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
It is the era of computers and its involvement is ever increasing in every sphere of life.
Many people have reservations over this increasing involvement of the computer in financial matters.
Where use of credit cards bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
So that now, you can be located by transactions from your credit card.
And in future when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent, its benefits will increase more and more.
Similarly in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, it is easier to steal credit card information.
Similarly computers have become the source of friendship.
Social networking sites, like Orkut, Facebook, and Myspace are at a high level of acceptance.
Do you think that the more we follow these social networking sites, we get farther away from people in real life?
The matchmaking websites, where you are shown a list of the people who match your desires, have a similar aspect.
Can you live happily with a person who is just like you?
I cannot, and I think that is why the spouse is called the better half.
He or she will help me address faults within me in a positive and productive manner.
Perhaps I received a lesser share of wisdom. 
From childhood, I thought that anything that adults told me was true. 
In the same way, I was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world. 
I was even ridiculed a lot for this reason. 
But only plausible things seemed true. 
I was always perplexed at the need to tell a lie. 
Even at this age, I suffered because of it. 
So I tried to keep the lies to a minimum. 
I refrained from giving false hopes to others, particularly with Allah’s name. 
And only say, ""God willing"" when I wished the work be done. 
Allah always knows what is in their hearts. 
This is a disturbing problem which appears because the religion is misunderstood. 
According to both our religion and the law in Pakistan, infants should remain with their mothers. 
Their father is responsible for their financial needs and he may be allowed to see them. 
Then when they mature, they live with whom they want to live.
You are right that the actual problem is the relatives who misguide.
Feudalism has overshadowed our deeds.
Even here, thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in father's property so it is resisted, although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated.
Here these restriction regarding relations have created many evils in the society.
The concept of remarriage of a divorcee or a widow is getting rare.
Due to these unnecessary beliefs and tradition, the family system is facing disarray.
In our society, if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarry, then why it is not appreciated?
There is a Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago, now after getting all his children married when he married a widow, his own children have gone against him.
In my opinion, this is religious right, what do you say?
What type of mentality is the "'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place" kind of mentality?
I believe that this person's children should have thought what's wrong if he married a widow after he married off all his children?
This widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
As the children would get busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow, if their wives refuse to look after them when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society we are facing for the last 40-50 years.
It is acceptable for a wife if her husband does unlawful actions but it is not acceptable for him to marry another woman.
If its in her power, she will not let him do so even after she dies.
It destroys her afterlife along with her husband's. It also lets the spreading of immorality in the society.
Nothing happens when singing about Islam. We actually like our traditions and cultures.
For example, we like keeping girls from getting an education and fear of love marriage.
About your question, instead of bringing his wife home, he goes to someone else's wife and the dependents make a fuss for the show and stay quiet and satisfied. ( yeah, later the relatives of the wife get angry)
In the Indian subcontinent, we accepted Islam centuries ago but we could not let go of this illiterate thinking of how our culture and traditions are not more valuable than Islam.
Considering man's 2nd marriage as ridiculous, divorce as denigration, divorced as untouchable, love marriage as dishonor and considering a man marrying an older women is dissimulation of the women is only the result of this way of thinking.
Over all, by copying the western world, we are declaring the religious veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam was easy but getting rid of this way of thinking is very hard.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Amen
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.
Century passed writing such little writing
Know that little is much.
Allah Hafiz
Ameer Taimoor in his book "I am Taimoor" writes, "I found this secret in my life that if the leader of any Army is in the front line, then that Army will never lose."
But here the situation is otherwise.
To say that common people are there to die for us, if we die then we are a martyr,
but, if someone from the common people dies then it is murder.
May Allah bless and have mercy on you.
When I was coming back to the shop after Isha prayer tonight, one man who was sitting in his car raised his hand and asked me to come.
I thought maybe this man has forgotten his way or maybe he wants to ask something. I stopped, and his whole family was in his car.
He asked if I can understand Arabic very well or not. I said that there is no problem. You can tell me what is the matter.
He started saying, I have come from Riyadh but here some one in Medina picked my pocket and I need help. I said no, because this has happened with me earlier also as I gave this man 20 riyals to pay for gas and go back to Riyadh but he started doing the same thing after moving forward a little.
I got really angry and when I threatened to tell the police, he vanished.
So now this is the condition of us Muslims that even when we come to beg money, we come with families riding in cars and daily manage to get at least 2 or 3000.
Although there is an saying of the Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the hand above is better than the hand below and the hand above is the giving hand the lower is the taking hand.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims (Amen)

The wife of the famous singer Adnan Sami went to a police station in Bombay accusing him of torturing her.
The police station suggested for her to contact a court.
Adnan Sami's wife, Saba Guladari, submitted a plea against her husband stating that Adnan Sami tortures her continuously.
and treats her inhumanely.
This has exceeded her tolerance limit, therefore a case should be recorded against Adnan Sami.
Police, instead of recording a report, suggested that she should contact the court by saying that this matter is not what is covered under police control.
In your opinion, is the accusation of Adnan Sami's wife on him correct?
What if this accusation is an attempt of tarnishing the name of Adnan Sami?
Let us know of your comments regarding this matter.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
As far as allegations are concerned, anyone can accuse someone else.
Nothing comes before prestige.
However the relations between Adnan Sami and his present wife may be, he left his respectful life and went to India to make money and now this fame has caught him badly.
This is a consequence of his own deeds.
Washington...
Top American officials say that president Obama will take a strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
In the new American policy over Afghanistan, there is more emphasis on war than development.
Officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achievement of American goals.  In his government there is corruption, drug business has increased, and Taliban are regaining their power.
American officials say that the people who are putting more pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more include Vice President Joe Biden and President Obama's representative for Afhanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke.
He said that this good administration was noticed after President Bush left, who used to have a video conference with Hamid Karzai every 2 weeks, which used to emphasize the role of America in Afghanistan and the development of its city departments.
Officials say that the Obama administration will work with state leaders as a backup to the main government.
Officials say that they will emphasize to Hamid Karzai the importance of fighting against corruption.
Hamid Karzai faces new elections this year. It is not yet clear whether Obama and his administration will favor his re-election or not.
Is this statement of the American officials a forecast of change in America's policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is this era of Hamid Karzai ending?
What are your thoughts in this matter?
In three one - day matches between Pakistan and Sri لنكاكے series in Sri Lanka has defeated Pakistan by 2 - 1 . 
In one - day match before facing defeat to Sri Lanka , however , Pakistan has won the next two میچزمیں Sri Lanka . 
The national cricket team in the third one - day match is very poor performance , Sri Lanka 's national team only in response to 309 runs ڈھیرہوگئی on 75 runs in 23 overs , and thus it faced a lesson nose of the defeat . 
This proves that the result of the series is not consistent with the performance of the national cricket team . 
Despite home ground , and all the دعووں was hit by national team defeated , in your opinion , what are reasons of this ? 
Authorities كوكھیل of what is necessary to pay more attention on sectors ? 
Are you satisfied with the selection of the team ? 
The defeat YOU HOW responsibility will lie on the Sector , fielding , batting or bowling ? 
aware of his opinion . 
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kinds of heathenish traditions continue to occur. These feudal lords target innocent people using their authority, who would call them Muslims?
A Sardar, himself should walk over these embers. Why doesn't the present government act against them?
When will the judicial justice be of use?
The Sri Lankan cricket team has reached Pakistan to participate in a one-day international series. 
Besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
Upon reaching the Karachi airport, the Srilankan team was very warmly welcomed.
Two one days between Pakistan and Srilanka in Karachi, whereas the third one day will be played in Lahore.
Both teams have there claims over bowling, batting and fielding.
If the Srilankans are proud of their spinners, the Pakistanis trust their fast bowlers.

Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.

The Kashmiri people have been fighting for independence for the last 60 years.
Since no one asked, they are now stuck in their war of extremism and terrorism. So, they start talking about making up.
First, they openly killed the Muslims. Now, they are in the efforts of setting things right.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating a situation so that the world's attention can be diverted from Kashmir.
Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now the British Government is also understanding that the Indians are taking cover from their corrpution over Kashmir by blaming Pakistan of terrorism.
They hesitate to talk to Pakistan over this issue.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that by resolving the issue of Kashmir it will bring an end to extremism, and the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
It should be clear that the newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister talked to the media in Mumbai and has written an article about the idea of the war against terror is wrong; killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan shouldn't be lenient with the extremist groups.
Due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, India is trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region.
Isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Is India using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialogue?

Usman Aftab,
I think that the major powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
Rather, it wants to want to keep it in check, and hence is thinking of taking certain steps. They know that Pakistan is a nuclear state.
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries seem to think that if they corner Pakistan they will face political and geographic problems. They want to help Pakistan, but they also want to be successful in their goal.
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition that in the side is a knife, and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn Pakistan.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.
Faheem Siddiqi
Ras al Khaima, This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but they  know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is now deep waters.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden, played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers movement not played any role?
What do you have to say about this statement from the Prime Minister?
Make us aware of your opinion.
American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference, advised newly elected President Barack Obama. he said  that he had made many mistakes in his presidency, and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
"I did, as a president, whatever I felt was appropriate, according to the situation. And according to American law and constitution, giving preference to American interest over my own acceptance."
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop it.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him And considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this was his last press conference, and he thanked the journalists and other friends who are present.
Do you think Obama will make the same mistakes that Bush made?
Did Bush delay accepting his mistakes?
Will Obama be able to follow Bush's advice?

American Vice President Dick Cheney said, "I want to see Osama Bin Laden alive or dead."
He said that Osama Bin Laden is hiding in some hard to reach area and is of no use to his organization, and if Osama Bin Laden is arrested alive or dead then his organization must be destroyed.
America intends to arrest Osama and the search for Osama is on.
Will Dick Cheney's goal to arrest Osama be accomplished?

After the completion of Quaid Azam Trophy match between PIA and Habib Bank, the all-rounder cricketer Shahid Affridi had a altercation with one fan.
When Shahid Affridi came out of the drawing room after playing the match on the UBL ground, a large number of fans gathered around him.
In one instance, a fan held his hand and asked to take a photo with him, after which Shahid Affridi removed his hand from the fan's and said that he can take the photo tomorrow. After further insistence from the fan, Affridi became angry and slapped him. An altercation then began between Affridi and the fan, though the crowd seemed to dismiss the matter there.
Shahid Affridi later said that he had been in a hurry to attend the prayer.
Nevertheless, I shall apologize to that spectator.
What would you say about this behavior of Shahid Afridi?

The Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, has once again accused Pakistan of provoking a war.
Pakistan is using terrorism as a state policy.
While addressing a Chief Minister's conference in New Delhi, Manmohan Singh said that the terrorist elements are backed by neighboring countries and especially Pakistan.
The terrorists of the Mumbai attacks used the far out to sea route and were safe from the Indian coast guards.
The Indian Prime Minister said that the November attacks were carried out by Lashkare Taiba.
He added that the terrorists are using modern techniques and the latest communication systems and said, "We'll have to be more rigorous over the line of control where the intrusion takes place". He said that terrorism will not be tolerated in any case and that is their policy.
How do you see this allegation from the Indian Prime Minister?
Do the internally opposed and separatist movements of India show the disturbed situation n India?
On whose orders is India taking this warning stance?
Give us your views.
Zubair Khan, Karachi
This is a sad calamity that Israeli is massacring the Palestinians and the same situation is prevalent in Kashmir, but there is no effect on the Security Council.
All factions in Palestine and Kashmir should keep their war going until they gain independence, and they should form unity among themselves and keep facing any type of harm, and one day or the other their martyrdom will give fruit, God Willing.
The air attacks by Israel on Gaza are continuing, just the same. To date, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
Important Hamas leader Nazariyan was killed along with his wife and children.
The UN Security Council meeting concluded without any decision.
The meeting saw American opposition to the resolutions passed criticizing Israel by Libya and other Arab countries.
For the last few days there have been bombings by Israeli planes on the Palestinian civilian population.
The whole world cried out about the Mumbai issue, but the Israeli attacks do not seem to matter to anyone including America and Britain.
Why are the important Islamic countries quiet?
What can say about this double standard of the world?
Saeed, New York
I think that most of our people are ignorant. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties. The electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has taken a serious position.
On the other side, there was an increase of an average of 18% in gas rates, while the unavailability of petrol in some cities has become a cause of great difficulty for the public.
Among the manufacturing and business circles, there are strong protests and severe protests against the long power cut and gas crisis.
The producers have given the ultimatum to close the factories.
Here in Karachi, the public is annoyed over the 8-10 hour load shedding.
Production has become practically paralyzed.
The government institutions are blaming each other to express their positions.
Are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas not a joke against the nation?
Shouldn't more attention should be given to solving the problems?
Are the wheels of national development not seeming jammed to the government?
What immediate steps can you suggest to gain control over this crisis?
Please let us know your opinions.
Imran Khokar from Madīnah Munawwarah: “I would like to say that rulers are a reflection of society’s morality. 
I am surprised that government is carrying slogan of public service is itself hurting them.
The unavailability of electricity, gas, and petrol has become a persecution.
Government has no control over the institutions.
Law and order is deteriorating every day, may Allah bestow his mercy on this country.
The new year has started.
Last year was the year of outbreaks and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered in reference to the terrorism.
The stepping down of President Musharf and the end of the eight years rule of president Bush; throwing of shoes on Bush and formation of democratic government in Pakistan; calamities; earthquake in Baluchistan; global financial slump and monopoly.
The new year is arriving, how do you foresee it?
In your opinion, what will be the result of the political or geographical situation? What will be Obama's strategy?
Is there a hope of a development towards eliminating terrorism?
Will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?
What position will the Indo-Pak relation take?
Is there a chance of surgical strikes or a full fledged war?
What are your expectations for the new year?

First anniversary of the death of Benazir Bhutto Shaheed is being celebrated. She was martyred on 27th of December, 2007 after a  congregation at the Liaqat Bagh in Rawalpindi.
Benazir's presence will be missed. She was a statesman, politician and world famous personality that held a unique status in national politics.
One year has gone by but the mystery of her martyrdom has not yet been resolved.
Her efforts in bringing democracy in Pakistan and the formation of government have not gone in vain.
Today, Pakistan has a democratic government and her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, is holding the chair of the president.
How do you see Shaheed Benazir's role in Pakistani politics?
Who can be behind her martyrdom?
She was recently awarded the global award for human rights. What would you like to say about her political and democratic services?
After presiding over America for eight years, President Bush has left the White House and moved to Camp David so the White House can be renovated to Barack Obama's tastes.
The destruction of the World Trade Center, attack on the Pentagon, and Bush's subsequent "war on terror" retaliation against Afghanistan and Iraq (with the assistance of forces from other countries) have become memorable examples of his presidency.
Due to this war, America faced the worst ever economic and financial crisis in its history.
What do you think the world achieved and lost as a result of this war?
Were the policies of Bush successful?
What is your opinion of Bush's presidency?
The Indian government has stopped its cricket team from visiting Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one-day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, in an interview with Jeev News said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour, but due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step? Should sports be separated from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that security conditions in India are bad, England's cricket team is continuing its tour. Therefore, why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this?
Salman, Karachi
Those people who are proud about going to India
and who make their films and videos over there, should now have their eyes opened as to how much the people of India respect them.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami should return to Pakistan first chance he gets because respect did not suit you there either.
Fareed Ahmed
Karachi
Indian's attitude has changed after Bombay Attacks.
Jagjit Singh has showed in  his reaction  that he hates Pakistan and Pakistani.
One should know that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsley. How is he a bad singer now? Adnan Sami should stay in India, there is no need to come here.
Muhammad Shamshaad Alam
Karachi, On the statement of Jagjit Singh, I would only say that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! Open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Bombay incident, their hateful statements have increased. The same people are now saying evil things against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
according to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq, when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said ""You dog this is a farewell kiss""
after that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards Bush. president Bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself.
second shoe hit the American Flag.
Security personnel's dragged the journalist away from there.
at this point, president Bush said that he didn't know why he had done so , Shoe was of number 10, and he didn't had any problem.
do you think this reaction of the journalist wasn't an expression of deprecation or President bush from the Iraqi people?
what would you say on this incident?
The tension between Pakistan and India's relations after the terrorism in Mumbai got further intense when the fighter planes from the Indian Air force violated the Pakistani airspace in Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
as a result of retaliation from Pak Air force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.
sources say that both Indian planes were loaded with ammunition.
This is the first incident of this kind  in the current tensed situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that they are all set for country's air defense.
Information Minister, Sherry Rahman, says that Indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed. Although this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
In your opinion, does India really have the intention of an air strike on Pakistan?
Is this statement of India correct? Was this violation  a mistake or was this to find out the ability of Pakistan Air force?
Is this incident going to aggravate the current estrangement among the two countries?

Respected martyr ,Benazir Bhutto, was given the International Award for Human Rights after her death, which was received by her son and chairperson of the People's Party Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.
During a session of General Assembly in United Nations headquarters, former prime minister of Pakistan, martyr Benazir Bhutto was presented with this award for acknowledgment of her efforts for human rights in a ceremony.
The 60th anniversary of the passing of the human rights resolution by the United Nations was celebrated on the 10th of December.
Among those people and institutes being honored on the occasion for working for human rights, apart from Benazir Bhutto, were:  former American Attorney General, Louis Ramsey Clark, and the Human Rights Watch, the organization that works around the world for human rights.
On this occasion, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations Abdullah Husain Harun and other senior embassy agents were present.
What do you think about the former martyr Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto receiving this award?
Samir
Chicago
It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she completely changed.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party and made her son the representative of the People's Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi, This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
But until the iron ax is not fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are just like this, that they are adopting secretive ways. This is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations have included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed as well as two other Pakistani citizens and the name of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organisations into the list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaidah and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, practically non-existent organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba Operation Chief, Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organisations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organisations, they will be restricted from traveling and will be under arrest.
They will have to face cases.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India accusing these organizations of being responsible for the Mumbai Attacks when they do not have any proof?
Why doesn't India have any local terrorist groups?
Are these world organizations aware of the persecution of minorities in India?
