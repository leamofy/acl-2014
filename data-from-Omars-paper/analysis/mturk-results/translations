Because of their degrees, they refuse to do what they think low work and in fact work with the hands is thought to be dirty and shameful in such countries.	Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.	Thomas red who was a former director of the Cooperation in the National Laboratory technical committees in Los Angeles, United States has written this book.
this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.	The work of a completely uneducated farmer is far more important than that of a professor: we can live without education, but we die if we have no food. If no one cleaned our streets and took the rubbish away from our houses, we should get terrible diseases in our towns.	In this book, called 'Nuclear Express', the political history of the bomb and its spread, both the authors claim that whichever country made an atom bomb either stole the nuclear secrets from another country or they got help from a nuclear power.

And he could see a dark future of Meerklay groups.	when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.	After which the business people found difficulities to raise fund from 30 bank, then only he was in the headlines of the newspaper. which reflects a bad future for the mircale group	when he had to negotiate with 30 banks for weeks regarding his debts towards industrial groups, he became the hot news and could see the dark future for Marckay group.
The Merkel Group had to suffer financial losses of many millions of Euro after its investment to buy shares of German auto maker Volkswagen.	The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.	The aim of advertising is always to sell the product or let the people know the various facilities made available to them either at the market or at their doorstep.	Marclay Group had to bear the loss of hundreds of million euros after it bought the shares of one of known industry Folks Wigan.
Then monetary institutions canceled this groups loan amounting 700 million and another 1 billion Euro that it necessarily required and hence Merkel came into extreme pressure.	Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 to one Billion Euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle went into deep pressure.	When a product is being advertised we are able to gather more information such as its name, price,benefits and availability in short, it is a brief actual account of itself.	then the financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed 100 Million and 1 billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on Marclay.
Some time back the bank agreed to provide Merkel Group an emergency loan but Adolf Merkel who raised from a small industrialist to the position of a strong industrial group whose annual income was approximately 30 billion Euro, could not bare the loss in his investment capability.	Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had got to this position from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic powet.	But sometime the drafted messages tend to be fictional too, owing to either exaggeration or to false claims made by the advertiser. Viewed objectively, the advertising message must act as a salesperson and do its best to convinced consumer of the merits of the product.	Recently the same banks accepted to provide loan to Marclay group on urgent basis but Adolf Marclay who started as a small industrialist to reach a place where his industrial group's annual income reached 30 billion euros, couldn't bear the the loss in his financial strength.
Adolf Merkel, after the death of his parents started managing the business and took to modernize it.The business under his supervision became very popular and became more strong.	After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quick, putting it on new lines.	The words used in advertisements are typical of a salespersons' language and this is how he would like to convince his prospective buyer,should they come face to face.	After the death of his father when Adolf Marclay took the responsibility of the business he used modern methods and made the business more successful.
He named his company Ratiopharm which is today Germany's very large acclaimed and successful pharmaceutical company.

Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm, Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.	More often, they are colorful and catchy words as they persuade the customer to respond favorably and force him to purchase the product. Unless cosmetics and other like Kassbohrer products are heavily promoted, they will languish unsold on the shelves of this stores for a long time.	Till recent times this phamasutical company had a budget of around 5 to 6 billion euros and even now it is earning around 8 billion euros annually. After the great success of Rasue farm the Marclay Group bought many big industries like Hi-Del Barag Cement a manufacture of construction equipment. Kassbohrer and other good car maker
The workforce of Merkel Group is nearly about 100,000 throughout the world and its assets include Ratiopharm which always was the most important business in the portfolio.	The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm always had special importance.	So, advertising always puts forward the best points of the product. Advertisement can be educative, entertaining, informative handy and surely interesting.	Marclay Group has a employee number of around 100 thousand around the world and among its industries, Rasue Farm has always been given special importance.
Adolf Merkel during his liftime expressed the view may a time that " It has been four generations that we have been in pharmaceutical business.	Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.	At times, however, they tend to be boring, irritating, incredible and embarrassing.	Adolf Marclay has said this many times in his life. ""We have been in pharma business since four generations"".
Now the management of this institution is with my children and I hope this institution will be for few hundred years be managed by and in possession of my family.	Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.	Another category of advertisements tends to brag so as to tempt the buyers.	Now the industry is handled by the children and i hope that it continues to work for few hundred years by our family.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, the banks have provided approval for temporary loans of 400 million Euro for VEM Group but added the condition that VEM should sell off Ratiopharm to improve the financial situation for a long term sustainability.	After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have sanctioned 400 million Euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.

The history of civilization shows how man always has to choose between making the right and the wrong use of the discoveries of science. This has never been more true than in our own age.

In this practice, our Pakistani Wire-net media, in particular some columnists and newspapers are not far behind any more, as they are writing with courage against the growing extremism and terrorism and stressing a lot upon 'Muawiyah hate'.	Now even the electronic media as well as printed media of Pakistan, specifically a few urdu newspapers and columnists, are not behind anybody else in exhibiting this skill- who,while giving coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism, and while writing about it, hide facts about the grudge mafia.	in this art now a days the Pakistani electronic and print media, specially some Urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone, who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the "grudge of Muavia" written on them.	Now In this regard our Pakistani print and electronic media, specially few Urdu newspapers and columnists etc. are not behind in the trade who in the coverage or writing of increasing terrorism exaggerate to hell.
He said that the United Nations which speaks of human rights and peace, but though the Muslims ar being oppressed greatly, you hear them say that until Hamas does not stop it's attacks, this unfair policy will continue.	Has been said that United Nations seemingly supports human rights and peace but actually the muslims are being subjected to extreme levels of cruelty and brutality. And what we hear from United Nations is that Hamas should stop the attacks. How long will this hypocrisy carry on.	has said that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. how long this hypocrisy will continue.	At one side the United Nations, which apparently talks about human rights and peace, Muslims are wronged and tortured to their limits , but the United Nations only condemn Hammas attacks.

Why Muslims are getting abused, If People like America will leave the back support of Jews then Allah has said clearly that this caste will spend there life contemptible and this caste can not spend there life good,  if American Citizens has the guts to leave the Back support of Jews then see the Fortune of the life of Jews	Why there is so much atrocity on Muslims. If people like America leave backing up of Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So if Americans you have courage then leave backing up of them and see then their fate of life.	Why is so much oppression being done on the Muslims? If people such as America stop supporting these Jews, then Allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support, and then see what kind of life they get.	Why are the Muslims tortured that much, if the American people stop favouring Jews then as God said that they would live worst lives, so Americans, u stop favouring them and then see their fate
The People who are killing and murdering the people on the name of peace and justice they have to understand this clearly that in this world peace will come only and only by administer an Oath not by doing injustice and semination	So-called writers and murderers in name of peace should understand that peace in the world can only and only be obtained through giving justice not through genocides.	The famous just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.	All these world renowned leaders and people who murder innocents in the name of peace should realize that peace in the world can only be achieved by justice, and not through injustice or wiping entire races.
If only by doing semination u can kill the caste and want to withdraw the results what you want then after Hitlers Measure not only the Jews caste was continued but in one way the ascent as today was impossible	If any nations can be perished through genocide and results of choice can be obtained then after actions of Hitler, existence of Jews and their uprising was impossible.	If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.	If killing a particular race off completely is the answer, then Hitler's plan would not have seen any jews survive, and definitely not seen their rise.

May the Muslims think collectively.	I saw Bombay blasts operation like this fire was in my own house. Can not see the sorrow of mankind. And can anyone not see this sorrow? Alas if Muslims would think as one.	I watched the Mumbai attacks investigations like the fire was in my own home. I cannot watch this human suffering. Can't everyone else see this suffering?

As for elections, there is no doubt, to gain public support, such actions will have to be taken for the sake of power, especially in a state like Israel. As for Barack Obama, history is witness that no American ruler has been able to go against the American policy and nor will they go. Whether the ruler is white or black, he is still a ruler.	In Israel, such tactics are used by ruling party to achieve public support.Historically no president was powerful enough to change American policies.Barrack Obama is no exception. Forces of Exploitation are similar in their character; whether they are black or white.	Considering elections, the rulers should do such activities for people's support. There is no doubt in this specially when countries like Israel exist. Rest talking about Barrack Obama, then history is the witness that no American leader has gone against the policy and nor will do it. Regime, whether black or white, is a regime.	As far as elections are concerned, it is not surprising that the people who are in power do such things to win the heart and mind of people especially in a state like Israel. And speaking of Barak Obama, history shows that no American president has wavered from the policy and will not do so in future. A tyrant is a tyrant whether he is white or black.

If democracy was dearer, why did she leave the republic for ten years in the control of Musharraf, waiting for American clearance and deal?	If Democracy was her motto then why did not she come before American clearance and deal? Whey did she leave democracy under the control of Musharraf's dictatorship for 10 years?	If democracy was so dear then  why was it left in 10 year dictatorship of Musharaf until American clearance and the deal.	If she sacrificed for democracy then why she left democracy in the dictatorship of Musharraf for 10 years till she got a deal and American clearance?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when the people needed her the most, unfortunately she came to Pakistan when she had to deal with cases and was promised a seat of power.

Though the question raised from the B.B.C. is substandard, it could only be felt pity at the poor quality of the writers. For instance, nobody asked this. What were the 3000 soldiers camping at Swat doing ?	The BBC, was asked the question is not enough to write to see the superficialness regret, for example, a question did not present in the Swat 30 thousand army has been to what?

There is no doubt in this that majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are the members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined  the party  named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.	There is no doubt that majority of the workers of Jama'athud Da'wah are the previous members of Lashkar-e-Taiba who joint the group called Jama'athud Da'wah Pakistan, after Lashkar-e-Taiba was rendered inexistent.	There is no doubt that the elements of Jamat-ud-dawa include majority of those people who belong to Lashkar-e-Taiba which is a banned organization, is now established and operating with a new name Jamat-ud-dawa Pakistan.	There is no doubt that the majority of the movement league are from the Tayaba Group, who joined the league after the inception of Pakistan.
Although these members preferred subsidiary activities and now after India's great persistence, The United Nation has invalidated it also and Government of Pakistan is continuing the crack down against them.	However, after that, the members gave preference to social work, and now even Jama'athud Da'wah was rendered inexistent by the United Nations, due to the pressure applied by India and the crackdown being enforced by the Pakistani government.	However after that more focus was diverted towards humanitarian activities and now on India's strong request , the United Nations has also banned it and the government of Pakistan has also implemented a crack down on this organization.	However, after that,  this leagues obstructed aid campaigns, and now on India's insistence, United Nations has declared them as the enemy and even the Government of Pakistan is cracking down on them.
In my opinion, it is better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.	I believe that if Jihadi groups leave religious fundamentalism and take up social efforts, that would be better.	In my opinion if these Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and get focused towards religion and humanitarian assistance then it is much better.	In my opinion, if these Jihadi groups quit this religious fanaticism, and try helping instead, then it would be better for all.
Terrorist groups present in Pakistan, who support professional criminals and the heads of those Mullahs are those who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.	The present terrorist groups that bring up criminals in the name of Jihad, and the elders of these Mullas, are the same people who used to call 'Pakistan' 'Palidistan', and who knows what else.	The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan which have used the name of Jihad to induct and nurture professional killers and criminals and their molana's are the same people who called Pakistan 'Plaeedistan' meaning un clean land. These are the people who use bad named for Pakistan.	The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan are employing professional criminals in the name of Jihad, the mentors of these and the mullahs are the same people who called Pakistan, Paleedistan and what not from time to time.
And now they are doing everything to destroy Pakistan.	Now they are not leaving any stone unturned in destroying Pakistan.	Now they are trying their best to destroy Pakistan.	They are not letting any stone unturned in the destruction of Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called Human beings, let alone Muslims.	Actually, these are not even fit to be called human beings, let alone 'Muslims'.	In reality they don't even get close to be called a Muslin, in fact they deserve to be called animals or barbarians	They do not deserve to be called humans let alone muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan from these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.	Without cleaning Pakistan of these mischief mongers, the national security will remain at risk.	Pakistan security will stay at risk until these extremists are not eradicated from Pakistan.	Without rooting these miscreants out of Pakistan, the national security will be at risk.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous or not?	Can we still think about whether or not to put a ban on these mischief mongers?	Should we still  think that the innocent people will be charged with rules and regulation?	Is there still room for consideration whether these scoundrels should be banned?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose work is only to kill.	There is no place on earth for extremist Mullahs whose only work is to cause killings.

What kind of world is this where it is hard to live for one who takes the name of one major pillar of Islam,  religion of Allah.

Placing in front of us the heart struck attacks of Bombay, we certainly do not have to dive to find the reasons for this disturbance in Karachi. But there is one simple and easy reason that this disturbance was the result of spilling of blood subconsciously.	Keeping the heart rendering Mumbai attacks in view and diving to search for a cause for the violence in Karachi is not at all needed, rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in 'blood'.	Keeping in view, the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai, we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in Karachi. It is simple and easy to guess that the turmoil is just due to an unconcious trade of blood.

Consequences of noises.	I'jaz A'wan	Ejaz Aiwan	Ijaz Awan
many of us who live in large towns and cities have grown used to working in noise which comes from several different sources. There is the noise of moving trains which is heard at almost all hours of the day.	Sir, before you get a large number of people with proposals, I shall tell you that the open signs of this mischief is also found on the walls of Karachi, in the form of posters and wall chalking.	Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.	Before that you gather a crowd of people giving suggestions over the night,I have to tell you that we can find true evidences of real missbehaving in the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalkings and posters.
The Jet planes that fly over head produce noise of even greater loudness and intensity.	We have been bearing both types of mischief.	We have been tolerating both kinds of actions.	We have been bearing both kinds of misbehaviour.
Most of us have no time to think of noises on one type or another.	Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan. They did not have to face any reaction.	These thugs did not even forgive Pakistan and the founder of Pakistan, they did not face any reaction.	By the way,vegabonds even did not tolerated newly existed Pakistan and its founder.But they have never faced any reaction.
They become part of our daily lives.	Contrary to that, they are pecking at the chest of Pakistan.	On the contrary, we are writing our hearts on the chest of Pakistan.	In return,creating problems for the same country,Pakistan
But there is something to be thought of-does noise affect our lives in some harmful ways.	There used to be one Muslim League (n), but they also made the rough version of the 18th amendment and handed it over to the Peoples Party.	One Muslim League N was left, even they made a draft of the 18th amendment and gave it to People's Party.	Only Muslim League (N) was left, she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to Peoples Party.
already there is evidence that it does so in several ways. It has been recognized for a long time.	Before that, MQM and Muslim League (q) had already handed in rough versions of the 18th amendment to the national assembly and senate.	Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q have made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment in the National Assembly and the Senate.	Before this MQM and Muslim League (Q) has already submitted the draft of 18th amendment in assembly and senate.
Now that exposure to noise high intensity leads to loss of hearing. There have been cases of boiler-makers, for example, whose suffer from occupational deafness.	It still seems that the copies of the 18th amendment is a political trickery, and no one is sincere about accepting that amendment.	Till now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.	Till now it appears that 18th amendment was a political move and none of the party is sincere in its approval.
More recently it has also been found that people who are continuously exposed to other loud noises require protection of the ear.	This is why no fuss was made in the assembly or on the floor of senate over this amendment, and the parliament was not forced into accepting the amendment.	This is the reason why  no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.	This is why nobody has raised voice in the favor of this amendment in senate or assembly and neither forced the House to approve the amendment.
If we live in industrial areas which are growing with every passing year, there is the deafening noise produced by the speakers in house or shops, radio sets in the neighborhood, school children at play or at chorus practice of arithmetical tables, and so on.	It looks as if the parties just wanted to get the thing off their backs by submitting the rough versions, so that tomorrow, they may say that we had submitted our versions of the amendment, but the government speaker did not take action.	It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part that is they will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft, government speaker did not take any action.	It seems that by submitted the draft of 18th amendment these parties has beaten around the bushes means they can claim that we had submitted the amendment but the ruling party's speaker did not proceed.
MQM is i coalation with government, Muslim League(N) is secret partnership with government and Muslim League(Q) is the party that passed 17Th ammendment, then how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17Th Amendment	MQM coalition partner of government, Muslim League N an underhand ally of government and Muslim league Q the party to approve the seventeenth amendment then how is it possible that these parties can be sincere to approve the disapprove amendment.	MQM the government, Muslim League N in the opposition and Muslim League Q was the party who passed 17th amendment so how is it possible that these parties will be sincere in finishing the 17th amendment.	MQM an ally of government, Muslim League (N) secret friend and Muslim League (Q) has approved the 17th amendment, then how is it possible that they are sincere in removing 17th amendment.
This is the way to get ones name entered in the list of martyrs by just getting painted.	its just like writing your name amongst shaheeds by just putting color on yourself.	This is what is called getting credit for nothing.	It is like painting red to be counted amongst martyred.
The Peoples Party is otherwise not in hurry to end the seventeenth ammendment.	Peoples Party anyway is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment.	People's party is already not in a hurry about finishing 17th amendment.	Peoples Party is not what so ever in a hurry to remove 17th amendment.

Zardari would not have opted to be the President, if seventeenth ammendment was to be abolished.	if the seventeenth amendment was to be cancelled then Zardari would never had become the president.	If 17th amendment was to be discarded then Zardari would have never become the president.	If 17th amendment ought to be removed then Zardari wont become president.
Now he is more powerful than President Musharraf, since along with President he is also  the chairman of Peoples Party.	Now he is even more powerful that president Musharaf as along with being the president he is also the chairman of the Peoples party.	Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf. Because with being the president, he is also the chairman of the People's Party.	Now he is more powerful then President Pervez as along with the President he is the Chairman of Peoples Party.
The seventeenth ammendment is there till he is the president.	as long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.	17th amendment is valid until he is the president.	Till he is president 17th amendment is there.
Political Parties will have to remove President Zardari first, in order to abolish  the seventeenth ammendment.	in order to cancel the seventeenth amendment, the political parties will first have to dismiss president Zardari from the presidency.	In order to finish the 17th amendment, the political parties will have to bid Zardari farewell from the president house.	For removing 17th amendment political parties has to depart President Zardari from President house first.
This is not the will of MQM nor of other parties.	neither MQM wants this nor other parties.	Neither MQM nor other parties want this.	Neither MQM wants it nor the other parties.

During your childhood when we our uncles doing their work we prayed Allah to protect us from physical labor.	And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.
To save ourselves from this, we wrote a letter to the editor of the Amroz daily, asking him what we can do after metric to save ourselves from having to toil.	to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what should we do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor work.

Karachi, our leaders should understand this that people, they are doing the operation against, are the true valuers of Pakistan, who are tolerating all kinds of tortures but they love Pakistan.	Our rulers should understand that the people they are fighting against are our own. Who are taking upon every problem because they love Pakistan
