If the United States wants to save its reputation in the international community, it will have to end its support of Israel and refuse to be a partner in its crimes.

Analysts are of the view that the efforts of the US President are aimed at saving America's deteriorating image in the world, but it will be extremely difficult for him to succeed in this task, because as long as the US continues to support the oppressive Israeli regime, nothing good can come of it. If the United States wants to save its reputation in the international community, it will have to end its support of Israel and refuse to be a partner in its crimes.

According to the daily, Tony Blair said that it is important to find a way to include Hamas in the Middle East peace process. Blair strongly criticized the Bush Administration's policy of engaging Mahmud Abbas and completely ignoring Hamas. It is worth noting that Western countries have realized the public influence of Hamas and are now talking about including it in the dialogue process. Earlier, they called Hamas a terrorist organization - a terrorist organization that is defending its country, and is busy struggling to liberate its home from enemy occupation and free its houses and homeland from Israel's oppressive regime of occupation which has lasted for 60 years.

Instead they should have highlighted qualities of God such as mercy. Incidents like hanging dead bodies (on trees) and their literature, like the book titled "What will happen after death?," also create a sense of terror and fear.
