mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0008	4	This research has proven wrong the old saying that "while suffering from fever, it is better to abstain from eating."

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	3	In the book, entitled "Nuclear Express: The Political History and Spread of the Bomb," both writers have claimed that any country that has made an atomic bomb has either stolen nuclear secrets from another country or has done so with the support of another nuclear power.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	4	During one of the interviews with US News, Thomas Reed said that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb in 1990, during the time of Benazir Bhutto.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	5	He said that his belief that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb is based on several reasons,
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	6	including the design of the bomb and information collected from conversations with Chinese scientists.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	7	He said that this is why Pakistan was able to respond in 1998 to India's nuclear test with their own test only two weeks and three days later.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	8	Thomas Reed reminded the interviewer how, when Russia conducted a nuclear test in 1961, America responded with its own test only 17 days later, despite the fact that it had had the bomb for quite some time.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	10	When Thomas Reed was asked why China would provide Pakistan with nuclear technology, he responded that it is because India is a common enemy to both Pakistan and China.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	11	He said that there is evidence that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan used the Chinese design, and that this was later verified through documents acquired from Libya.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	12	When asked whether it is common for countries to collaborate in nuclear testing, he gave the example of how America expressly conducted a nuclear test for Britain in 1990 in the Nevada desert.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	13	He said they also speculate that Israel was provided access to the results of this test.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	14	Reed was also asked whether China has plans for continued nuclear expansion.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	15	He responded that China has been providing raw materials, guidelines, and designs for nuclear installation in the Iranian city of Isfahan since 1991,
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	16	and has provided Iran with a production plant in Karaj.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	7	As Union President, the role of the Czech Republic has already been weak.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	8	On top of that, internal disputes have rendered it helpless.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	9	On the other hand, French President Sarkozy is acting as though he is still performing the presidential duties of the European Union.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	14	However, both Foreign Ministers are making different statements about the war in the Middle East.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	15	Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself, while Kouchner thinks that this war cannot be called one of self-defense.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	16	Evidence of this is Israel's conduct, which does not show any respect for Europe's conciliatory efforts.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	2	Adolf Merckle of Southern Germany's Swabia area has left a large business group behind,
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	3	but until some time ago the average German citizen did not know much about him.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	4	When he had to carry on negotiations for several weeks with the nearly thirty banks who lend money to his industrial group, he became the topic of headlines and began to see the future of the Merckle group as bleak.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	5	The Merckle group was forced to suffer millions of euros in losses due to the financial crisis, after purchasing shares of the German Volkswagen manufacturer.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	6	So when financial institutions refused to make new loans of between 700 million and one billion euros to this group, which they desperately needed, Merckle came under intense pressure.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	7	Just recently the same banks had agreed to provide loans to the Merckle group on an emergency basis, but Adolf Merckle, who had moved from being a small industrialist to the position that his industrial group's annual income was approximately 30 billion euros, could not withstand the deprivation of his strength as a capitalist.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	8	When Adolf Merckle took charge of his family's business after the death of his father, he greatly improved the business very quickly through a process of modernization.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	9	He named his company "Ratiopharm," now the biggest and most successful pharmaceutical company in Germany.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	10	Until recently the company was worth between 5 and 6 billion euros, and it still generates an annual income of 8.1 billion euros. After the tremendous success of Ratiopharm, the Merckle group purchased several large institutions, including HeidelbergCement, a manufacturer of construction materials, and Kaessbohrer, a manufacturer of special vehicles.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	11	The number of Merckle Group employees worldwide is nearly 100,000, and the Ratiopharm pharmaceutical company has always held a special place amongst its assets.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	12	In his life Adolf Merckle had said on several occasions, "This is our fourth generation of drug manufacturers.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	13	Now this company's administration is with my children and I am hopeful that in the coming few hundred years it will remain under my family's administration."
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	14	After the suicide of Adolf Merckle, banks approved a temporary loan of 400 million euros to his VEM group, but on the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that the group's financial situation can be improved over the long term.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090112.0005	5	According to Joachim Herrmann, Interior Minister of the Bavarian Province, this only appears to be a positive change.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090112.0005	6	He said, "It is necessary to keep in mind that the number of foreigners obtaining German citizenship is increasing.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090112.0005	7	Therefore, when presenting the statistics, this fact should also be made clear that even when the criminal is a German citizen, his background may be foreign.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090112.0005	8	Herrmann said that in 2010 his province will take this into account when collecting data about criminals.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090112.0005	9	In addition to Bavaria, thinking is being done along the same lines in the province of Hamburg.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090112.0005	11	Ahlhaus directed attention towards an analytical report from the provincial office of crime prevention prepared in 2006 in which the percentage of foreigners' involvement in crime was studied in the Bergedorf borough of the city of Hamburg.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090112.0005	12	Results showed that here
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090112.0005	13	the rate of crimes committed by foreigners is less than the crime rate for the entire province.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090112.0005	14	In contrast, when the crime rate amongst adolescents was studied in 2006 in Berlin, it was seen that the rate of adolescents with foreign background was

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090112.0005	16	However, other German political parties, such as SPD, the environmentalist party Garbanz, and the left-wing party Linkspartei, are opposed to the idea of determining which German citizens have foreign background when gathering crime data.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364084-post1	5	And in the future, when the use of real money becomes extremely rare, it will be even more useful.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364084-post1	6	In the crime world too, instead of taking the risk of robbing a bank, the information from a credit card is hacked.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364084-post1	7	Similarly, now there are even ways of making friends through computers.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364084-post1	8	Social networking websites like Orkut, Facebook, and Myspace rank highest in terms of popularity.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364084-post1	9	But don't you think that the more we comply with these social networking sites, the more we are getting distanced from people on a practical level?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364084-post1	10	There are even match-making websites, where your preferences are matched with the preferences of other people and the list of those compatible with you is provided.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364084-post1	11	Now can you spend your life with another person who is just like you?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364084-post1	12	I cannot. The reason why a life partner is also called the better half
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364084-post1	13	is that they make up for my flaws.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364087-post8	1	I may have gotten the lesser share of wisdom.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364087-post8	2	Since childhood, whatever my elders said was the truth to me.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364087-post8	3	For example, I was sure that my father knew the answers to all the questions in the world.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364087-post8	4	I was even made fun of because of this.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364087-post8	5	However, something seemed true to me only if it could be possible.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364087-post8	6	It was very perplexing why there was a need to lie.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364087-post8	7	I even suffered at that age for this reason.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364087-post8	8	Therefore, I try to lie as little as possible.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364087-post8	9	I try not to give anyone false hopes, especially in the name of Allah.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364087-post8	10	And I only say "Allah willing" when praying to Allah that he fulfill some request.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364089-post3	1	This is a nauseating problem, which has arisen because of estrangement from religion.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364089-post3	2	According to both our religion and the law of Pakistan, young children should stay with their mother.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364089-post3	3	It is the father's duty to take care of their expenses, and he is allowed to meet with the children.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364089-post3	4	Then when the children grow up, they can live with whomever they want.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post1	1	Why does our society frown upon the re-marriage of a 50- or 55-year-old husband or wife who has lost his or her spouse?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post1	2	We have a Pakistani uncle close to us. His wife died ten or twelve years ago. When he married a widow after getting all his children married, they all turned against him.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post1	3	In my view this is a right that has been granted to him by the Sharia. What do you think?

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post10	1	The feudal mindset dictates all our actions.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post10	2	The same mindset is at work here, that our father will have more children to claim their share in his property, so he must be stopped; if it weren't for this, their father's act would be praised and emulated.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post10	3	It is these hang-ups about marriage that have created the evils in our society.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post10	4	The concept of a marriage for a divorced or widowed woman is becoming extinct.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post10	5	Because of these useless beliefs and misplaced traditions, the family system is breaking down.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post2	1	I think this man's children should consider that if he married a widow after getting all of them married, what did he do wrong?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post2	2	This way the widow got support, and the uncle also got someone to take care of him.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post2	3	Because his children must have gotten tied up in their own worlds, giving him no time.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post4	1	The reason behind this is ignorance.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post4	2	If their wives refuse to take care of them when they're old, what will they do?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post4	3	This is a result of societal pressure.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post4	4	When people ridicule a family for such a thing, children start to feel embarrassed because of their father's re-marriage,
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post4	5	when they should face up to the situation and say that what their father did was completely in accordance with Islam.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post6	1	This is a curse in our society, which we have been suffering from for the last 40-50 years.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post6	2	A wife even accepts it if her husband goes around having extra-marital relations, but she does not allow him to marry a second time.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post6	3	If she could, she wouldn't even let him do it after her death.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post6	4	On top of ruining things for her husband, she ruins them for herself in the afterlife as well, and also gives cause to the spread of filth in society.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post7	1	It's no use talking about Islam; in reality we only like what goes along with our traditions and customs.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post7	2	For instance trading girls for marriage, killing girls for accusations of adultery, depriving girls of an education, and shooting them for marrying of their own choice.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post7	3	As far as your question is concerned, instead of bringing the widow to his own home, if the man had gone to the widow's home, his heirs would have settled down and been satisfied after making some fuss about it (although the widow's heirs would then become jealous).
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post9	1	Although we accepted Islam in the Indian sub-continent centuries ago, to this day we have not been able to get rid of this ignorant mindset and still prefer tradition and custom over Islam.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post9	2	A man's second marriage is obscene, divorce is a blot that cannot be hidden, a divorced woman is untouchable, marriage by choice ruins reputations, and a man's marriage with a older woman is seen as a result of the woman's trickery. All these attitudes reflect the same mindset.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post9	3	And to copy the Western nations we call abstinence and using the veil an outdated thing.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post9	4	Accepting Islam was easy; getting rid of this mindset is very difficult.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-83-174268-11364090-post9	5	May Allah give us all the strength and courage for this.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-84-174269-11325249-post1	3	I thought, maybe he's lost or wants to ask me something. I stopped and saw that his whole family was sitting in the car.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-84-174269-11325249-post1	4	He asked me if I could understand Arabic well or not. I said, "No problem, tell me what's the matter."

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-84-174269-11325249-post1	7	The situation has become such that we Muslims take our family with us on a car to beg and make at least two to three thousand a day.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	3	This book has been written with the title 'Nuclear Express:A Political History of the Bomb And its Proliferation,' and in this both the authors have claimed that any country that has made an atomic bomb has either stolen the nuclear secrets of another country or has had cooperation with some other nuclear power.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	4	Thomas Reed said in an interview to US News that in 1990, in the era of Benazir Bhutto, China had conducted the experiment of Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	5	Thomas Reed said that he is convinced on the basis of several reasons that China has conducted the experiment of Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	6	Those reasons include the design of the bomb and information obtained while talking to the scientists of China.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	7	He further said that this was the reason why in 1998, Pakistan was able to conduct a nuclear experiment just in two weeks and three days in response to India's nuclear experiment.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	8	Thomas Reed also reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and it took 17 days for America to do the experiment in response to this, although America already had this bomb for awhile.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	9	He further said that the atom bomb, whose experiment was done in 1998 by Pakistan, was developed with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had full confidence in it.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	12	To another question as to whether it is usual to carry out nuclear experiments with others, he said that in 1990 America openly conducted a nuclear experiment for Britain in the desert of Nevada.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	4	Then, when he had to negotiate with about 30 banks for many weeks which provided loans to his business group, he became the subject of the headlines, and the future of Merckle Group also looked to bleak him.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	7	Sometime back, these very banks had agreed to provide loans to Merckle Group on an emergency basis; however, Adolf Merckle, who had risen to such heights from a small industrialist that his group's income had become around 30 billion Euros, could not bear the loss of his investment power.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-72-174253-11359731-post1	4	This is because of the same reason that no one has so far made any hue and cry in favor of this amendment on the floor of the Assembly or the Senate and forced the houses to approve this amendment.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0008	3	The research found that mice fed with a low-calorie diet had relatively weaker immune systems for fighting off the flu virus.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	3	In their book, 'The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and its Proliferation,' Reed and Stillman claim that every country that has ever produced a nuclear bomb has been able to do so because it stole the nuclear secrets of another country or enjoyed the cooperation of another nuclear power.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	4	In an interview with US News and World Report, Reed alleged that it was China who conducted the first nuclear test for Pakistan in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's first term in office.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	5	Thomas Reed said that he was sure that China had conducted Pakistan's nuclear testing for several reasons.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	6	These reasons included the design of the bomb and information gathered in interviews with Chinese scientists.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	7	He added that this was why Pakistan was able to conduct nuclear testing in 1998 just two weeks and three days after India's nuclear explosions.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	8	Reed recalled that in 1961, the former Soviet Union had conducted a surprise nuclear test and the United States took 17 days to respond, despite the fact that it had possessed nuclear bombs for a long time.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	9	He added that the bomb that Pakistan tested in 1998 was made with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had complete trust in its effectiveness.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	10	When Reed was asked if China had also provided Pakistan with nuclear technology, he replied that India was the common enemy of both Pakistan and China.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	12	In response to another question, whether conducting joint nuclear testing was a routine occurrence, he said that the United States openly carried out nuclear tests for Britain in the Nevada desert in 1990.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	13	He added that Israel was presumably given access to the results of these tests.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	14	Reed was also asked whether China was continuing its nuclear proliferation program.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	15	Reed responded that China had provided the raw materials, instructions and design for the nuclear installation at Isfahan in 1991.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	BBC_URD_20090103.0021	16	China has also provided Iran with its enrichment plant at Kherej.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	6	In reality, the EU is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	7	On the one hand, there is the weak Czech president of the EU,
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	8	hindered by internal squabbling over Europe.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	9	On the other hand, there is the former French president of the EU, who would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as EU president.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	10	But France has already completed its six-month term of presidency.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	11	Sarkozy wants to lead, and is capable of it - but is no longer allowed to.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	12	Especially disturbing is the stance of French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	13	He is part of the troika led by the Czech Republic's foreign minister, Schwarzenberg.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	14	It is a particularly delicate situation because Kouchner and Schwarzenberg take very different public stances on the Mideast conflict.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	15	Schwarzenberg focuses on Israel's right to defend itself, while Kouchner says Israel's military actions are disproportionate. What's more, the Germans are sending a special envoy to the region to negotiate specifically on behalf of the German government.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	16	The result can be seen in the attitude of the Israeli government, which seems to find all European attempts at diplomacy irrelevant.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090106.0006	17	There is a good chance that the Europeans can play a constructive role in the region because the US has failed in the Middle East due to George W Bush's policies.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	4	He became the subject of headlines when he had to negotiate with nearly 30 banks to provide loans to his industrial group and realized that the Merckle Group was doomed.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	11	The Merckle Group employs around 100,000 people worldwide and Ratiopharm also plays a vital role for the Group's finances.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	DEW_URD_20090108.0002	12	Adolf Merckle had said: "Our family has been involved in the production of medicines for four generations.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	MHR_URD_20090115.0013	3	Ahmadinejad, in his message, asked the Saudi king to express a righteous stance on Gaza and support the cause of this oppressed people in order to frustrate the attempts of enemies to create differences among Muslims.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	MHR_URD_20090115.0013	4	In his message, Ahmadinejad said, "You are aware that Israel has been committing genocide in Gaza for the last 19 days, is carrying out the massacre of innocent children and bombing houses, mosques, schools and hospitals. The Zionist regime is busy perpetrating the mass murder of innocent Muslims in Gaza, and the silence of leaders of your stature under these circumstance is boosting Israel's morale."

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	MHR_URD_20090116.0010	3	Bush said that terrorist enemies were patiently looking for a chance to strike the United States again and they are determined to do so, but Washington is also not oblivious to its security.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516103-post18	5	Also, no interest was taken in its development and prosperity.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516103-post18	6	The number of girls who were attending school in recent times was several times lower than the number who used to study in the past.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516103-post32	1	The question that should be asked is what benefits the ISI and the Pakistani agencies will reap.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516103-post32	2	The people of Swat have now understood this game, which is about serving the Taliban, not killing them. Otherwise, how could five persons have been killed in one night in a state of curfew? How could people could have been hanged in the main street of the city after being butchered?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516103-post37	1	Since the government failed to implement its law in Swat, then how it can succeed in preventing these illegal actions?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516103-post37	2	The question is that, while the government agencies possess everything from armed forces, modern firearms, and modern technology to spy systems, why can't these outnumbered Taliban be controlled?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516103-post37	3	The answer is that they are supported by some 'hidden power', as neither are their weapons turned over, nor are they caught.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516103-post37	4	In a nutshell, the Taliban are facilitating the actions of a global imperial power through their evil deeds.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516103-post40	1	Fifteen years ago, there was war in Afghanistan.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516103-post40	2	The Taliban were controlled by the ISI, while the rival Northern Alliance was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516103-post40	3	All of a sudden, the situation changed. And, all of the actions of the Taliban became clear.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516103-post40	4	Also, the ISI was offered dollars by the US. Hence, the friend turned to foe.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516103-post40	5	In the current situation, the war is still going on. But, the supporters in Pakistan are the same: Iran, India and Russia.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post1	1	Israeli offensives targeting Gaza have entered the third phase of three in a row. The death toll has reached 1,000.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post1	4	On the other hand, relief agencies have accused Israel of not caring for Palestinian children's safety, saying a complete generation of Palestinian children will suffer from psychological and emotional problems.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post11	2	For example, if a thief realizes that theft is a bad habit and a curse, and that it brings punishment and the wrath of God, then this realization will serve as an effective deterrent for him, and he will not proceed with his plan of theft.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post11	3	Similarly, as long as Israel fails to realize that it is doing wrong by killing innocent people, and that it will be punished for doing so, it will continue to shed the blood of innocents in Gaza.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post13	1	Greetings!
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post13	2	The question is: are war, armed struggle or terrorism solutions to the problems?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post13	3	If not, then what is the useful prescription that may potentially lead to solving the problem?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post13	4	It is correct that war and the path of violence do not solve problems. On the contrary, they further complicate them.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post13	5	In order for their movements to be successful, Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should opt for the model implemented by Nelson Mandela in South Africa.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post13	6	Morals, political struggle and Jihad against oneself should be given more of a chance than armed struggle.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post13	7	The participation of Kashmiris in the election process is a reflection of the acceptance of this point.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post27	4	Who will burn girls' schools?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post27	5	Who will commit abduction in order to demand ransom? And, after not getting the ransoms, who will murder the abducted people and hang their dead bodies on trees, labeling them as American spies?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post27	6	The Taliban have done far more harm to Islam than any religion or nation ever has.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post28	2	The issue of the immediate end to the war will not only be talked about, but will actually be stopped.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post28	3	But, sadly, from where will our Muslim rulers get the courage to do so?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post28	4	It would be better if somebody would suggest to Ahmadinejad to take the initiative, as his courage is much appreciated on the BBC forum.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post5	1	The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights does not fall on the Arabs or Muslims of the world alone. Rather, it is the duty of the nations of the world to raise a voice against injustice.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post5	2	This dreadful incident is the worst of the sins Bush has yet committed.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516107-post5	3	The US administration has given Israel the green light to do whatever it wishes, just as government institutions in India and Pakistan freely indulge in the worst form of corruption before June 30 -- i.e. before the end of the fiscal year, each year.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post11	1	On one hand, the US says that efforts will be made to stop the war.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post11	2	On the other, the United Nations has been passing resolution after resolution. However, both have done nothing practically on the ground -- a matter that sends only one signal -- that the United Nations is also prepared to ruin Muslims.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post11	3	All Muslim countries should withdraw their membership from the United Nations immediately, and should form a global body of their own.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post11	4	We have several examples where the US and the United Nations make promises and pass resolutions, but Muslims just continue to suffer.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post14	1	What is the use of these comments, which the BBC will never publish?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post14	2	Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? The BBC becomes biased when innocent Muslims are killed.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post14	3	However, it claims to be the champion of truth.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post14	4	It does not even publish the comments, let alone say something on its own.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post14	5	The comments of Muslims
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post211	1	The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and kill Muslims, while you live among Muslims, call yourselves Muslims and (kill) Muslims.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post211	2	[syja786]
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post211	3	A particular community is being targeted in the BBC forums, sometimes in the guise of suicide attacks and at other times in the guise of terrorism in India.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post211	4	The favorite expression of the people making these anti-Islam comments is "extremism."
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post211	5	But, the question is: who's the real extremist? That can more easily be determined from the comments mentioned above, which label writing against Iran as disloyal.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post213	1	When will we Muslims realize that Dajjal (an evil figure in Islamic eschatology) cannot be fought with the sword?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post213	2	The Israeli bombings targeting unarmed people are making us shed tears of blood. What else can we do?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post213	3	But the main fault lies in the acts of corruption and killing that we call "Jihad," thus damaging the image of Islam.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post213	4	When the majority of Palestinians have already recognized Israel, what is the use of Hamas's firing rockets or carrying out suicide attacks against Israel?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post213	5	The behaviour of both sides is inhumane.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post213	6	Again we notice that the US and the United Nations are playing a role that supports the injustices perpetrated by Israel.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post214	1	May Allah unite the Muslim Ummah! Amen!
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post214	2	May they (Muslim Ummah) think about giving a prize for carrying out the difficult task of combating terrorism to the real terrorists, because they are the ones who are doing the real job. 
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post214	3	Otherwise, is terrorism of such a magnitude possible without the backing of some big leader? Everybody knows who stands behind it (terrorism).
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post214	4	In simple words, they may be termed as behaving like Big Brother.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post214	5	The powerful strikes the weak, and, at the same time, doesn't allow him to weep.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post215	1	Arab rulers are giving money and medicine for the injured and burial supplies for the dead.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post215	2	People are asking what should be done about Israeli offensives.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post215	3	In fact, the problem is that the leaders of Muslim countries, including the Saudi rulers, are sleeping. They neither have an army nor a defense plan. They believe they have fulfilled their duties by merely donating relief materials.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post215	4	They should take practical measures against Israel immediately.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post215	5	For example, by imposing an oil embargo on European countries and America.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post217	1	Greetings to all brothers and sisters!
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post217	2	I feel that advising Hamas, at this critical juncture, to give up its struggle in the name of peace, is synonymous with injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands of orphans, and to neutralize their efforts.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post217	3	If Israel and its supports have reached the height of pharohism, then a Moses will emerge in their homes soon, as this is the rule of nature. American and Israeli actions are nurturing suicide bombers among Muslims.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post217	4	This is a fact that people obsessed with power cannot understand.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post230	3	Rightly said.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post230	4	Let us suppose that Hamas is one hundred percent correct, and seeks to earn God's favor by fighting a holy war against injustice. Nevertheless, they must know, at the very least, that if their holy acts contribute to making many families homeless, then what is the use of such holy acts?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post230	5	Loving human beings is part of the belief of those who claim they love God, His prophet and their religion.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post27	1	It's as if Allah has ordered the cleansing of all Ahle-Kitab (believers in divine books) other than Muslims from the face of the earth.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post27	2	Najeebur Rahman Saeko, Lahore, Pakitan.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post27	3	No, it has not been ordered to cleanse them, but rather to invite them (to Islam).
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post27	4	However, it has been ordered to wage Jihad against those who hatch conspiracies against the religion.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post27	5	Such people should be fought until they stop hatching conspiracies, though in a manner that is never careless.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post39	1	Brothers, the fate of the killers of innocent children is destruction.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post39	2	However, I would like to point out that the Israelis had no place to live in the past. Today, there are so powerful that they don't listen to anyone in the world. The reason is that they are united and one.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post39	3	They have no sects, like Shia or Sunni. They are all Jews. They have made all means of development and progress in all fields.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post39	4	In contrast, what is the condition of the 55 Islamic countries?
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post39	5	They are backward in all spheres. Now, they are so helpless that enemies are killing them and they are waiting for their death.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post42	1	The need of the hour is that all Muslim countries must unite to work out a strategy against Israel.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post59	1	The most painful aspect is the lack of unity between Hamas and Fatah.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post59	2	Great leaders like Yasser Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken the only courageous people of the region who have been fighting a holy war (Jihad) for the sake of the Al Aqsa Mosque. It was impossible to achieve this goal without getting Yasin and Arafat out of the way.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post59	3	The world has since witnessed how Palestine has been disintegrating after the death of these two leaders.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516120-post59	4	And the Jewish lobby has really been tightening its grip.

On the one hand, when people are killed in India, the whole world condemns Pakistan and pushes it to carry out operations, or to be ready for operations against it.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516125-post71	3	But on the other, Israel is openly cleansing itself of Muslims and the whole world is keeping silent. It can't be tolerated.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516128-post30	4	Benazir did not return to Pakistan at the time when the people who were reeling under the dictatorship needed her most. Unfortunately, she returned to Pakistan only when the cases against her were cleared and she was assured of power.

However, when India had captured him, India had said he was a senior engineer. Later on, India said he had passed only fourth standard. These statements need to be scrutinized.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516146-post164	5	It is quite clear that there is something else going on behind the scenes.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516146-post52	1	Since the time of the dictator Ziaul Haq, who was the real dictator, Mullahism has been reminding us about different types of punishments and telling wise stories in the name of religion, creating an atmosphere of terror.

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516146-post77	1	The dead body kept hanging for a whole day. I have just one question to ask. Where was the army? What were the soldiers doing? Is their only job to target the common man? Their statements read as: 'Taliban positions bombed, 2 children, their mother killed'.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-NG-102-174502-11516146-post77	2	Didn't they know about that place?

mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-72-174253-11359731-post1	4	This is the reason why no one has created any uproar about this bill in the Assembly or the Senate floor to pressure the house to get this bill passed.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-72-174253-11359731-post1	5	It seems that, by only submitting the amendment bill, they cleared the air and can say that they had submitted the amendment but the government had not acted on it.
mt09_urdu_evalset_current_v0	urd-WL-72-174253-11359731-post1	6	The MQM is an ally of the government, the Muslim League (N) is supporting it from behind, and the Muslim League (Q) is the party which will get the 17th Amendment passed.
