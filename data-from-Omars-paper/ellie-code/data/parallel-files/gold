Exercise is good for the health at every age.
Doctor Patricia teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.
She headed a study about heart disease and the ability of humans to exercise in old age.
A team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to examine the performance of the heart
Experts have focused their attention on the left side of the heart, the side which pumps the blood.
Dr. Garvan Kane was a part of this study.
The man introduces himself with the name Abu Talha and speaks in German.
The video message also has Arabic subtitles.
The Al Qaeda logo appears on the side of the screen, and the video is dated October 2008.
In the message it is stated to the German government that if, by stationing military in such large numbers in Afghanistan, their country means to express its belief that it will not be attacked, what could be more nave?
The person calling himself Abu Talha did not threaten to attack Germany directly, however.
Currently the number of German troops included in the united NATO army in Afghanistan is approximately 3,500.
This is the first message received by Germany from Al Qaeda.
Most German newspapers and advisors consider this attack to be related to the Al Qaeda message.
"They are making Germany a target."
Fundamentalist Muslims have a negative and critical view of Germany's Afghan policy.
And for this reason they very much consider Germany to be their target.
The Lebanese government says that it is also trying to find out who is behind these rocket attacks.
BBC's correspondent has declared this to be an extremely dangerous turn in the current crisis in the region.
Meanwhile, on Wednesday night, Israel's air force launched sixty air raids on the Gaza Strip.

It is said that apparently she started amateur singing after being encouraged by her mother.
While paying tribute to her mother she says, "You were intelligent and beautiful; you did everything in the same style."

When viewed from an official standpoint, the role of the European Union in the conciliatory efforts to stop the war in the Middle East is decisive.
Amadeu Altafaj, spokesperson for the European Commission, said that every effort by which the European Commission's concerted message can be sent to warring parties is praiseworthy.
As far as its official statement is concerned, everything looks fine.
As Union President, the role of the Czech Republic has already been weak.
On top of that, internal disputes have rendered it helpless.
On the other hand, French President Sarkozy is acting as though he is still performing the presidential duties of the European Union.
Even though France has completed its six-month presidential term.
French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner is faced with the most ludicrous situation.
He is included in the delegation led by Czech Republic's Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg.
Evidence of this is Israel's conduct, which does not show any respect for Europe's conciliatory efforts.
He said that his belief that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb is based on several reasons,
including the design of the bomb and information collected from conversations with Chinese scientists.
He said that this is why Pakistan was able to respond in 1998 to India's nuclear test with their own test only two weeks and three days later.
He said that there is evidence that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan used the Chinese design, and that this was later verified through documents acquired from Libya.
When asked whether it is common for countries to collaborate in nuclear testing, he gave the example of how America expressly conducted a nuclear test for Britain in 1990 in the Nevada desert.
He said they also speculate that Israel was provided access to the results of this test.
He responded that China has been providing raw materials, guidelines, and designs for nuclear installation in the Iranian city of Isfahan since 1991,
India says that the extremist group Lashkar-e-Tayaba is responsible for the attacks.
Relations between the two countries have declined after the Mumbai attacks.
These two places (Pakistan and Britain) were the ones that I was worried about."
India and the international community have put a lot of pressure on Pakistan to take action against those responsible for the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan says it has taken dozens of people into custody in its actions against groups allegedly involved in the Mumbai attacks.
Wajid Shamsul Hassan said, "We are not trying to cover it up.
We believe in taking action based on facts.
Our investigation should meet with the world's approval.
A forty-two-year-old British citizen has admitted that he hacked the website of the American Army.
Gary suffers from Asperger syndrome. A person suffering from Asperger syndrome has an obsession with doing one type of activity.
Lord Justice Morris K. and Mr. Justice Simon when declaring the verdict said that Gary is allowed to make an appeal in the British Court.
They went on to say that the Interior Secretary has not considered this matter.
Gary has never denied hacking the website of the American Army.
Gary had hacked the American Navy and NASA systems along with 97 computers.
According to recent statistics, between 2004 and 2007 the crime rate of foreigners
decreased from 22.9 percent
to 21.4 percent.
According to Joachim Herrmann, Interior Minister of the Bavarian Province, this only appears to be a positive change.
He said, "It is necessary to keep in mind that the number of foreigners obtaining German citizenship is increasing.
Therefore, when presenting the statistics, this fact should also be made clear that even when the criminal is a German citizen, his background may be foreign.
Herrmann said that in 2010 his province will take this into account when collecting data about criminals.
Results showed that here
In contrast, when the crime rate amongst adolescents was studied in 2006 in Berlin, it was seen that the rate of adolescents with foreign background was
Before this, MQM and Muslim League (Q) had already submitted drafts of the eighteenth amendment in the National Assembly and the Senate.
Until now, it appears as if these drafts of the eighteenth amendment are a political ruse and no one is sincere about getting this amendment approved.
This is why no one has spoken up on the floor of the Assembly or Senate in support of this amendment nor forced the House to approve this amendment.
This is a way for them to appear to be martyrs.
The People's Party is in no hurry to get the seventeenth amendment annulled anyway.
Why would anyone want to get their own hands cut off?
As long as Zardari is president, the seventeenth amendment is not about to be annulled.
If the seventeenth amendment had been annulled, Zardari would have never become president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Musharraf because he, along with being the president, is also the chair of the People's Party.
As long as he is president, the seventeenth amendment will remain in place.
New research has found that drinking three cups of tea daily
This research conducted in the American state of Florida's Moffitt Cancer Center has found that for women less than 50 years of age, the risk of breast cancer tumors
Research has also found that drinking three or more cups of tea daily does not hold any particular benefit in this respect for elderly women.
Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.
Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles to women who did not have breast cancer.
Almost one in ten breast cancer patients has this type.
Experts say that by regularly drinking at least three cups of tea everyday the risk of breast cancer can be lowered significantly in young women.
They say that including tea as an everyday drink in your everyday routine creates adequate immunity in the body against cancer.

The Merckle group was forced to suffer millions of euros in losses due to the financial crisis, after purchasing shares of the German Volkswagen manufacturer.
So when financial institutions refused to make new loans of between 700 million and one billion euros to this group, which they desperately needed, Merckle came under intense pressure.
When Adolf Merckle took charge of his family's business after the death of his father, he greatly improved the business very quickly through a process of modernization.
Until recently the company was worth between 5 and 6 billion euros, and it still generates an annual income of 8.1 billion euros. After the tremendous success of Ratiopharm, the Merckle group purchased several large institutions, including HeidelbergCement, a manufacturer of construction materials, and Kaessbohrer, a manufacturer of special vehicles.
Now this company's administration is with my children and I am hopeful that in the coming few hundred years it will remain under my family's administration."
Security forces raided an alleged camp of the banned Lashkar-e-Tayaba in the Pakistani controlled area of Kashmir.
After the Mumbai attacks, increasing pressure is being placed on Pakistan to speed up its actions against extremist organizations.
India accuses Lashkar-e-Tayaba of involvement in the Mumbai attacks.
They say that the extremists who attacked Mumbai undoubtedly used Pakistani territory.
In the past 48 hours, this is the second attack on the NATO and American supplies in Peshawar.
In the meantime, Pakistan has raided an alleged camp of the banned Lashkar-e-Tayaba. Efforts were made even before this to disarm the armed groups from Karachi to the tribal areas, and those who surrendered their arms were assured that compensation would be given to them and that no action would be taken against them.
Events tell us that the former Soviet Union's intervention in Afghanistan during General Zia-ul-Haq's period, and efforts to eliminate the armed groups that were born as a result of the resistance to it with America-Saudi funding, to take Pakistan to the state it was in before 1980, were not successful.
The question is, does Pakistan want to do this?
Does Pakistan have the capacity to do this?

Even these rains are like you
Even these rains are like you
Even these rains are like you
When they fall, there is spring
When they pause, there is rest
At times, coming without a reason
At times, engulfing day with night
At times there is noise, at times silence
Even these rains are like you

Most of the elders of my family belong to the working class.
When I used to see my paternal and maternal uncles and the rest of them working for daily wages, I used to pray in my heart that God would save me from such physically rigorous labor.
To get out of this, I wrote a letter to the editor of the Amroze daily newspaper and asked what I should do after graduation so that I don't have to do hard labor.
The editor wrote back that I should become a doctor or an engineer or take such-and-such subjects.
My inclination had always been towards engineering, and I had even taken technical drawing in school instead of biology.
But at the time of the F. Sc. admissions, my older brother forced me to do my F. Sc. in medicine and become a doctor.
I studied biology with difficulty for a month, but when I couldn't make heads or tails of it, I changed the subject and took math instead.
It means the dread of physical labor made me an engineer and now I have a better job than most of my peers in the family, for which I constantly thank God.
Not even half an hour had passed when my younger son said, "Dad, looks like I wasn't made to do this kind of work."
I said, "If this is true, then study hard like me and save yourself from having to do hard labor."
My son said, "I am studying and I'll keep doing it, but I can't do this work."
We got the job done as best we could in three hours and returned home.
The point is that if a man sets his sights on something, whatever his reason is behind that, nothing can stop him from getting what he wants.
India, as a consequence of the Mumbai attacks,
India has constantly held the militant and non-militant groups in Pakistan accountable.
The return of the relations to normality is being attributed to the action that was taken against these groups.
This is not the first time that the relations between both countries have been strained by some terrorist activity in India.
In December 2001, after the attack on the Indian parliament, both countries had come to the brink of a war.

No member of the Republican Party has voted in favor of President Obama's plan.
In the House of Representatives, 244 votes were cast in favor of this package and 188 against it.
This economic recovery plan is to be presented next week in the Senate where the ruling Democratic Party has a minimal majority.
It is feared that due to the Republican Party's severe opposition, its approval by the Senate will not be easy.
After the approval of the economic recovery plan in the House of Representatives, Barack Obama urged the members not to let political differences get in the way of this important plan.
The president said that this plan, which he hopes will become a law by next month, will prove to be helpful in creating a favorable environment in the country for American commerce to thrive.
They emphasized the bill proposed by their own party in which more consideration has been given to tax reduction.
They said that through their package, perhaps more opportunities for employment can be created with less investment.

He said that the committee is hopeful that the newly elected American president Barack Obama will address the Muslim world during his first 100 days in office so that the gulf between America and the Muslim world can be bridged.
Mushahid Hussain Sayed said that, not only should emergency steps be taken to fill the gap between the Muslim world and the West, but also old problems like those of Kashmir and Palestine should also be solved.
The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the problem of Palestine should be solved according to the resolutions of the United Nations.

This is Hamid Karzai's second visit to India in the last five months.
It is hoped that during the meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh he will talk about conditions after the extremist attacks in Mumbai.
During this visit, he wants to express the feelings of Afghanistan and its people about the Mumbai attacks and their solidarity with India.
Besides extremism, there will be discussion regarding mutual trade during Karzai's visit.
During his last visit to India, President Hamid Karzai had said that terrorism will not be allowed to hamper the relations between India and Afghanistan.
"Peace and stability is beneficial for everyone - for both countries, the region, and the entire world.
We understand the fact that only by joining forces can the two countries and the entire world fight the curse of terrorism."
In July of last year, Hamid Karzai had held ISI, Pakistan's secret service, responsible for the attack on the Indian Embassy in Kabul.
In that attack a high IFS worker along with four Indians had been killed.

Yousaf Raza Gilani and Joe Biden (file photo
Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani has said that America's Vice President-elect Joe Biden played an important role in ex-President Pervez Musharraf's removal of uniform and withdrawal from his position as Army Chief and Joe Biden helped greatly in the cause of democracy for Pakistan as well.
Yousaf Raza Gilani made this statement at the Karachi Shipyard when talking with reporters.
He said that Joe Biden is a "Pro-Pakistan" leader, supportive of Pakistan, and as Chairman of the American Senate's Foreign Affairs Committee he presented a bill to give 15 billion dollars in aid to Pakistan.

Yousaf Raza Gilani said that the government has very successfully separated terrorists from common tribal members, but the missile attacks by spy planes are harmful to the government's efforts, so terrorists again join with local tribes.
He said that the international community agrees with Pakistan on this issue.
The Prime Minister also said that if any credible evidence is presented, then Pakistani forces will take action themselves in their own areas.
Reiterating his stand about the Mumbai attacks, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said that if India provides evidence, then an investigation will be conducted on that basis, and if proof of anyone's involvement is found, then action will be taken against that person according to national law.
Mumbai Police Commissioner Hasan Gafoor said that the hearing of the case registered against Ajmal Amir Kasab, the only accused person captured alive during the extremist attacks on Mumbai, will be conducted under the supervision of M. L. Tahiliani.
At present Ajmal Kasab is in police custody, and it is hoped that the police will submit a chargesheet against him before January 24.
Ajmal Kasab has no attorney to defend him.
In a letter written to the Pakistani government, Kasab had appealed for legal assistance.
Pakistan has accepted that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani citizen.
Ismail Khan died during the police activity and police captured Ajmal alive.
So far no attorney has been nominated to plead Ajmal's case.
Attorney Dinesh Mota of the Legal Aid Cell, who was nominated by the government, refused to take the case on ethical grounds.
The dead persons are said to be connected to the Frontier Corp and the police.
Eyewitnesses say that a letter was also found near the dead bodies in which there was a warning that whoever should pick up the dead bodies before eleven o'clock in the morning would be responsible for his own death.
Local people say that the dead bodies remained in the marketplace until eleven o'clock, but security workers later picked up the dead bodies and took them to the hospital.
During the past few weeks, a dangerous increase in the incidents of target killing has been seen in Mingora and surrounding areas
No organization has yet accepted responsibility for these killings.
On Saturday, Muslim Khan, spokesperson of local Taliban members in Swat, told BBC that three dead bodies among those found on Friday were of his associates, including Devlai's Taliban Commander Rafiullah.
Muslim Khan said that Rafiullah was in the custody of security forces for the past month and a half.
Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968.
Meanwhile, preparations are being made in Washington for an unprecedented gathering on the occasion of the new president's oath-taking ceremony on Tuesday.
About two million people are expected to assemble in Washington to watch the historical presidential oath.
On Monday, Barack Obama started his day by visiting a medical center in North Washington where he met with injured American soldiers. Afterwards, he went to a shelter established for homeless people and painted on a wall.
He said that Martin Luther King spent serving many people.
In that speech Martin Luther King said that a day will come when people will not be discriminated against because of their color.
BBC's Mathew Price says, "Call it historical irony that Martin Luther Day happens to be twenty-four hours before the first black president in American history will take his oath of office."
Pakistani intelligence authorities have said that at least eighteen people have been killed in North Waziristan in two suspected American missile attacks.
The Bush administration had avoided either accepting or denying responsibility for the attacks.
In Pakistan's North Waziristan tribal area on Friday, three missiles were fired by a suspected American spy plane and by which five people have been reported dead so far.
The dead have not been able to be identified.

Senior American officials say that President Obama will maintain a tough stand regarding Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
In America's new strategy for Afghanistan, war has been given more importance than development.
Officials say that Hamid Karzai is being considered a hindrance in the achievement of American objectives in Afghanistan because there is corruption in the government, the drug business has increased, and Taliban forces are reforming.
Officials say that the Obama administration will work with provincial leaders as an alternative to the central government.
Officials say that they will urge Hamid Karzai to continue the war against corruption.
Hamid Karzai will face new elections this year, and it is not yet clear whether or not Obama and his associates will support him for the presidency.
Is this statement by the American officials a prelude to a change in American policy?
Is Hamid Karzai's time coming to an end?
The electricity and gas crisis has reached a critical point all over Pakistan.
Industrialists have given an ultimatum for shutting down factories.
Here in Karachi, anxiety can be seen amongst the citizens because of the eight to ten hours of load-shedding.
Industrial activity has almost been paralyzed.
Governmental institutions are stating their position by hurling accusations at each other about the issue.
Isn't the talk of increasing the price of electricity and gas a joke to the nation?
Why isn't attention being given to solving the problems?
Can't the government see national progress coming to a standstill?
What immediate steps would you recommend to overcome this crisis?
Israeli warplanes have continued their bombing and missile attacks on Gaza since December 27.
So far, more than 300 Palestinian citizens have lost their lives in these attacks.
After the air raids, Israeli tanks and armor-plated vehicles have reached the border of Gaza with full preparation for a land attack.
However, Israeli authorities say that they will continue their actions in Gaza till they are sure that rocket attacks on Israel will cease.
In your opinion, is Israel right in saying that the action it is taking is part of Israeli efforts to defend its sovereignty?
In this situation, is the international community playing its role?
Is this brutal act indirectly linked to the upcoming elections in Israel?
Can some improvement in the state of affairs of the Middle East be expected after the newly elected President Obama takes charge?

I thought, maybe he's lost or wants to ask me something. I stopped and saw that his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked me if I could understand Arabic well or not. I said, "No problem, tell me what's the matter."
I got really angry and tried to scare him off saying I'd call a cop, so he took off.
The situation has become such that we Muslims take our family with us on a car to beg and make at least two to three thousand a day.
Whereas there is a clear tradition (may Allah bless him and give him peace) that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand because the upper hand gives while the lower one takes.
(May the most high Allah be kind to us and make us true Muslims. Amen.)
Peace, mercy, and blessing be upon you.

(May the most high Allah be kind to us and make us true Muslims. Amen.)
The tension that had been created in relations between Pakistan and India after the incidents of terrorism in Mumbai took a serious turn when warplanes of the Indian Air Force violated Pakistani air space in the Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
The Indian planes were forced to return because of the response by the Pakistan Air Force.
This is the first incident of its kind in the current tense situation.
The Pakistan Air Force says that the Air Force is fully prepared to defend the country.
Pakistan military sources have declared this a serious incident.
Do you think India, in reality, intends to undertake an air raid on Pakistan?
Will this incident become a reason for an increase of tension in the relations between these countries?
I may have gotten the lesser share of wisdom.
However, something seemed true to me only if it could be possible.
It was very perplexing why there was a need to lie.
I even suffered at that age for this reason.
Therefore, I try to lie as little as possible.
I try not to give anyone false hopes, especially in the name of Allah.
And I only say "Allah willing" when praying to Allah that he fulfill some request.
Now that the new year is coming, how do you see it?
In your view, what results come from the political or geographical situation? What will Obama's strategy be?
Will the judicial crisis in Pakistan end?
What direction will Pak-India relations take?
Is there a chance of a surgical strike or an all-out war?
What do you expect from the new year?
Every day somewhere or other they were expressing their anger by demolishing schools and colleges for women.
It is also made clear by this that the accusation leveled against the Taliban, that they're only against the education of girls is wrong -
Allah save them, they are against education itself.
May Allah the holy grant these holy warriors more strength
and help them uproot the corrupt government that has been set over us.
Amen.
First of all, Merry Christmas to Mr. Bahana and all the Christian friends of the forum.
War itself is a problem.
What problems will war solve?
Today it will result in fire and blood.
Tomorrow it will result in hunger and depravation.
This is why, thoughtful people,
it is better if we keep war at bay,
in your yard and ours.
Unidentified masked men kidnapped the Additional Political Agent ten days ago from South Waziristan.
Sources say that local Taliban members of the Mullah Nazir group kidnapped the worker.
According to the local administration, on Tuesday at around four o'clock in the afternoon, a tribal council brought Aamir Latif, Additional Political Agent of South Waziristan, to the Wana Scouts Camp.
However, they did not say who kidnapped the Additional Political Agent.
Aamir Latif had been kidnapped at the time when he was going from Wana to Tank.
On January 11, 2009, seven armed masked men kidnapped Additional Political Agent Aamir Latif along with his driver from the tribal area Karkanara of South Waziristan.
According to a government worker, the kidnappers first disarmed the guards present in the car, then sat the Additional Political Agent in a car and took him away.
He made this remark in Sri Nagar while speaking with reporters.
Allegedly mentioning the specter of terrorism being present in the land of Pakistan, he said that the Indian Army will be competing against those elements that are determined to upset peace and weaken India.
He said that in Indian Kashmir there are up to seven to eight hundred militants, of which approximately fifty percent are foreigners.
Ehud Olmert urged that for a complete evacuation of troops, an agreement for a permanent and durable cease-fire is essential.
Islamic militant organization Hamas said, while announcing a week-long cease-fire, that within one week Israeli forces should leave the Gaza Strip completely, and call off the blockade of the Gaza Strip.

In addition, the name of Saudi resident Mahmood Ahmed Bazik is also included in the list of terrorists.
Member countries will immediately freeze the assets of all these persons and organizations. They will not be allowed to travel, and they will be arrested.
They will be faced with court cases.
Why is India accusing these organizations of the Mumbai attacks without any proof?
Are there no terrorist organizations in India?
Are global organizations not aware of the oppression being done in India against the minorities?

And then we have your country, Pakistan, where even the president came into office only after getting the corruption charges dropped.
And to copy the Western nations we call abstinence and using the veil an outdated thing.
May Allah give us all the strength and courage for this.
Amen.

How is stable peace possible in Gaza?
For the sake of her own interests, Benazir provided India a list of names of the Sikhs who were fighting for their independence, whereby on the one hand she crushed their independence movement, and on the other she gave India the opportunity to suppress the Punjab movement and focus all its attention on Kashmir.
It was Benazir and Nawaz Sharif's tug-of-war for power that set the country many years behind.
Violating the London agreement she had made with Nawaz Sharif, Benazir made a deal with General Musharraf.
Benazir, during her time in office, freely gave her husband the opportunity to make money, and this is why he was called Mr. Ten Percent.
During Benazir's time, her brother was murdered and his murderers have still not been punished.
Despite being a woman herself, Benazir avoided fighting for women's rights.
Greetings. Go ahead, sir, take this action, but do it on your own.
Do not do it because of America's pressure.
And why does it blame everything on us?
There are extremist groups and organizations even in India. Why don't these people put a ban on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the whole world?
What is it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What is it that Israel is doing?
Holbrooke had played an important role in negotiating peace treaties in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

Barack Obama has already said in the past that there should be no pre-conditions imposed on the talks with Iran.

and using terrorism as a state policy.
The Indian prime minister said that Lashkar-e-Tayaba carried out the Mumbai attacks in November.
He added, "Terrorists are using new techniques and the most modern communication systems. We will have to heighten security on the Line of Control as well, from which intrusions are made." He said, "Terrorism will not be tolerated under any conditions; this is our policy."
Are internal turmoil and separatist movements in India reflective of the Indian anxiety?
On whose instructions has India assumed such threatening conduct?
Local Taliban members of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group have distributed a pamphlet in Miranshah, the capital of North Waziristan, and in other tehsils in which a threat has been made against government and semi-government educational institutions where boys and girls are provided with co-education.
This announcement forbidding the issuance of identity cards has been made at a time when approximately 200 women have submitted application forms at the NADRA offices to have their identity cards issued for the Benazir Income Support Program in North Waziristan.
According to the local people, the Taliban's pamphlet was read over the loudspeakers of all mosques in North Waziristan.
Police in the Bannu District also reported a landmine explosion Sunday on Bannu Miranshah road which killed one pedestrian and injured another.
He is smiling as if
This photograph has been taken just like a family picture.
Before this, such a photograph with one president and six American officials was never allowed to be published.
It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased so much that not just one official can take care of it, they have to team up - either that or they don't trust their new slave the way they trusted the one before him.
It could also be that this arrangement was made while keeping in mind President Zardari's notoriety for going back on his promises.
If the principle of democracy is applied to this photograph, President Zardari is in the minority.

President Ahmadi-nejad said in the message, "You should define your stand and support the oppressed in Gaza so that the efforts of the enemies to create rifts in the Islamic front will fail."

President Ahmadi-nejad said that Palestinians will be successful in Gaza.
I think there is no option but a final war.

For a long time after Pakistan came into being, the responsibility for Swat remained in the hands of the Guardian of Swat, who had his own army and law.
He handed over the administration of Swat to the Pakistani government according to an agreement.
But sadly, our government treated Swat like a step mother.
After the rule of the Guardian of Swat ended, there was no increase in the number of schools at all.
And nobody took interest in the development and progress of the area.
It's amazing when it is said that this cannot be the work of a Muslim.
We are ignorant of our own history, or we intentionally do not want to face it?
After the demise of the Prophet, due to the refusal to take the oath of allegiance, the door to his daughter's house was set fire, and who put a noose around her husband's neck, and dragged him around?

Whose war are we, the Pakistanis fighting?
And why do we also have interests that we will try to protect with all our might?
Nobody has the right to intervene in a country's affairs.
Now they are not leaving any stone unturned to destroy Pakistan.
Actually, far from being called Muslims, they do not deserve even to be called humans.
Is there still a need to think about whether or not these conflict instigators should be banned?
Probably he was not a revolutionary.
They are immortal even after death.
Whatever the hopes were in becoming a part of the "war of terror" he started thinking of himself as truly immortal

Hospital sources say that the badly wounded second DSP Ghulam Muhammad's condition is also critical and that bullets hit him in the head and neck.
The dead bodies were found near North Waziristan's main city of Miranshah and documents were found with them in which the men were accused of spying for America.
Authorities said that one of the dead bodies is probably that of a local man who had been kidnapped last week.
When a non-Muslim is killed, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why this double standard?

Americans are, quickly rather than gradually, strengthening their grip on Pakistan.
There is also one female minister in the eleven-member cabinet from Ateeq's opponents, the Muslim Conference party.
The ruling alliance says that there will be an expansion in the cabinet next week and there is a possibility that a dozen more ministers will be included in the cabinet. In the beginning of this month, Sardar Ateeq Khan's opponents removed him from his position as Prime Minister through a vote of no-confidence, and Sardar Yaqoob Khan was chosen as the new Prime Minister.
Portfolios of these ministers will be announced later.
When will our Muslim brethren understand that the sword cannot be used to vanquish tyranny?
Watching Israel bomb unarmed people, is that not a heart-wrenching experience?
Fundamentally, the blame can be placed on this conflict, murder, and destruction which we call Jihad, and thereby besmirch the beautiful name of Islam.
When the majority of Palestinians have accepted the existence of Israel, then why does Hamas attack Israel with rockets or target it with suicide bombers?
The attitudes of both sides are not humanitarian.
The corpses of those who fight the Taliban and support the army dangle all day long from the poles.
The Pakistani army is staging a play.
That the reason for violence is language?

Doesn't the Security Council always act expeditiously against Muslims?
This is called the nonchalant plaintiff and the zealous witness!

Its only aim is to amass wealth from the government, nothing else.

rather, they are thinking of ways to control it. They know that Pakistan is an atomic power.
They want to create some kind of revolution here.
Malik Yousuf, Dubai.
All this has been done by these people. Kashmiris have been fighting for freedom for the last sixty years.
No, no one asked them. Now that they are stuck in the war against extremism and terrorism, peace talks have been started.
First they massacred Muslims, and now they want to resolve issues.
As a poet says,
In such circumstances, the country needs a leader who can unite us as a nation.
May Allah always keep our country Pakistan safe. Amen.
Apart from this, the national situation also does not look right. The situation in NWFP, Balochistan, and Karachi in Sindh is right in front of you.
This brought to mind the recent marriage of a girl to a dog.
Look at that bridegroom, too.
Did they not know about this square?
Or were they watching the show?
We plead and beg for God's sake, put an end to this game.
How would this change affect South Asia and, in this regard, can some meaningful change be expected in the American policy?

Bush said that the terrorist enemies are waiting patiently to attack America, they have a firm resolve to attack America, and America should not be careless about its security.
The government should carry out an operation here and save a big and important city from terrorism.
Waazu!
You are the one who planted the fear of hell fire among all.
Finally, in Karachi, another tale of brutality registered the fear that every citizen had been feeling for quite some time.
Stayed awake the last three nights and the fear is still there.
Those who force people out of the hotels, and those who beat up cobblers and peanut vendors,
This is an evil spirit, which has taken possession of Palestine for half a century.
This evil spirit has many faces.
A number of times this evil spirit has used one of its faces to badmouth itself in order to get relief from the world's pressure and move attention away from itself.
India is creating a kind of situation to divert the world's attention from Kashmir,
Then suddenly the situation changed and the Taliban's bad behavior was exposed.
And ISI also got an offer of dollars from America, which changed the old friends into enemies.
Regretfully, the government's seizing of Lashkar-e-Tayaba has proven India right about Pakistan being involved in this affair.
Even if it is accepted that Lashkar-e-Tayaba is involved, it is not right to blame Pakistan's Government.
And another question is did these terrorists not have the support of some government or non-government officer in India?
And the real terrorists using these painful acts of terrorism against terrorism should be considered for a Nobel prize as, after all, they are the ones doing the real work.
Otherwise, how is terrorism on such a large scale possible without the backing of some bigwig? And everyone knows who the people pulling these strings are.
So, simply put, this is called gangsterism - do whatever you please.
Which these elephants, intoxicated with power, cannot understand.
The reason behind this is ignorance.
If their wives refuse to take care of them when they're old, what will they do?

There is no better strategy than to accept Israel as a state and to acquire from it the latest knowledge and ways of advancement, and let the world live in peace.
Muslims have a lot of land and resources as well.
What is the use of pretending if the BBC is not going to publish anything?
What has happened to all the journalistic principles? When innocent blood is shed, especially of a Muslim's, the BBC loudly professes neutrality.
Self-proclaimed bearers of truth!
Pakistan is working anyway to achieve the aims of Europe and America.
This in spite of the opposition of a majority of the population of Pakistan.
And this fuels more feelings against it.
Now Hamas and Israel should make peace so that this bloodshed comes to an end.
Absolutely correct.
Now who will explain to whom the meaning of terrorism?
The feudal mindset dictates all our actions.
It is these hang-ups about marriage that have created the evils in our society.
Even BBC Urdu is not telling the truth due to fear, while Pakistani media is even worse.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu-speaking people should learn Pashto, or the Pashto-speaking should learn Urdu, or it would be even better if both learn English.

But Jihad has been ordered against those who scheme against the religion.
Muttahida and ANP are responsible for the deterioration of the situation of Karachi, and the administration is being biased.

Palestine will always be a sacred place for Muslims of the whole world and its protection is our duty.
And we should also remember that it was designated as our first geographical orientation for performing our prayers.

Islam did not come about by force using a gun or a sword.
For a long time, a particular country has been targeted at the BBC forum behind the cover of the suicide attacks or terrorist activities in India. For quite some time, using suicide attacks and terrorism in India as an excuse, a particular faith has been targeted in the BBC forums.
Extremism is the favorite word in these anti-Islam discussions.
And this exposed America's reputation in this area.
Although India neither threatened to attack, nor does it have the guts to do so,
I have only one question for all the flag-bearers of humanity:
If you kill their children, will they welcome you with garlands for you? This is impossible.
what should be done about Israeli attacks?
They should immediately take some practical steps against Israel,
This is also evident from American history.
Fareed Ahmed,
Karachi.
The Indians' behavior has changed after the Mumbai attack.
Jagjit Singh has reacted to it by saying that he hates Pakistan and Pakistanis.
Now that we suspect America to attack Pakistan from Afghanistan, which the present American president has spoken about during his presidential campaign, why then should we disarm these people?
So that America or India, after subduing the Pakistani armed forces, do not have to face any kind of resistance from the people?

The day is not far away when a United Nations resolution relating to armed intervention in Pakistan will pass just like the way one was passed against Jamat-ud-Daawa.

As far as Lashkar-e-Tayaba is concerned, it has got nothing to do with the recent acts of terrorism.
I am completely sure that the Taliban's invasion is [a part of] American plans. Therefore, it is necessary to remove every person and group from the way who should challenge the Taliban in any way.

If the government is not being allowed to establish its rule in Swat, then how can the government succeed in putting an end to these activities that are against the law?
The answer to this is that they have the protection of some "secret benefactor," which enables them to neither run out of weapons nor get caught.
The answer to this cannot be found in any religion or any family tradition.
The whole media, including the BBC, is speculating about the Taliban and the tribes using different sources.
But nobody knows what the actual situation is. We know, because we ourselves are tribesmen.

Muhammad Shamshad Alam,
Karachi. About Jagjit Singh's statement, I would only say that he changes his color just like a chameleon,
changing his statement according to the situation. Pakistanis, open your eyes and see how little you are appreciated in India. Understand the mentality of the Hindus.
Hindus have always had the tradition of appearing calm on the surface but carrying grudges on the inside.

If she could, she wouldn't even let him do it after her death.
How to protest the corpses lying on the road, unattended injured, and innocent faces soaked in blood; cannot find words.
Feel like crying over the helplessness of Muslims. On the one hand, whenever people are killed in India, the whole world starts blaming Pakistan without any proof, asking it to take action, otherwise they will take the initiative.
On the other, Israel is openly conducting genocide of the Muslims, and the world is silent. This is unbearable.
Murtaza Gilani,
If there were a war, they would fight shoulder-to-shoulder with Pakistan.
So it is proven that this area was the homeland of the Israelis, too, for thousands of years.
Even Iran now wants to fight its proxy war from here.
Today, a few moments from now, a representative whose racial brethren were brought in shackles from their native lands to America, who strengthened the roots of modern day's most powerful land with their hard work, who suffered racial biases, will become America's 44th president.
Many people have a lot of expectations from this one person.

It's no use talking about Islam; in reality we only like what goes along with our traditions and customs.
Although there is no hope, but still, let's see to what extent Pakistan and America's relations turn in our favor as a result of this change.
Maintaining peace and taking care of human rights is not just the responsibility of the Arabs or the Muslim world; it is the duty of all the countries to raise their voice against injustice.
This sad incidence is the worst among the sins committed by Bush.
This act, which has been performed by Islamists in the name of religion, is highly condemnable.
The supporters of these extremists can see the tyranny of America, but instead of feeling sorry about such acts, they excuse them by labeling them as tribal customs.
This is heart-breaking news.
In 1974, there was a Pakistani prime minister who had such global prestige that he, for the first time, brought all Muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance.
Almost all of our political parties agree that terrorism and sectarianism should end in the country.
But our armed forces leadership does not seem sincere about this. On the one hand, America and Europe are assured that we are with them in this war against terrorism. On the other, the Taliban are also secretly provided with help.
For Operation Lionheart's success, and its success on the other side of the border depends on which side the common people are inclined to support.

At the peak of the Mumbai attacks, the failure of RAW that instigated riots based on linguistic differences in Karachi is proof that the political elements that used to work on RAW's payroll in the past have resigned from their job.
The unwarranted killings of the Pashto-speaking laborers and India's threats have awakened Pakistani nationalism from Karachi to Khyber.
Faheem Siddiqui.
Even before this resolution came to pass, the Pakistani people and army have conveyed whatever message they wanted to.
India's efforts to gain undue diplomatic and military advantage as a compensation for the Mumbai attacks have made it appear to be a clever, rather than effective, party. This is why, after the initial strong international reaction, now the world has reduced its pressure on Pakistan.
The question should be, what would ISI and the Pakistani agencies get?
