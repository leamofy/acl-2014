Marclay Group had to bear the loss of hundreds of millions of euros after it bought the shares from the known industry, Folks Wigan.
The financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed one billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on Marclay.
After the death of his father, Adolf Marclay took the responsibility of the business. He used modern methods to make his business more successful.
Until recent times this pharmaceutical company had a budget of around 5 to 6 billion euros and is now earning around 8 billion euros annually. After the great success of Rasue farm the Marclay Group bought many big industries such as Hi-Del Barag Cement, a manufacturer of construction equipment as well as Kassbohrer, a good car maker.
Now the industry is handled by his children and I hope that it continues to progress for a few hundred years by our family.

Most of the elders of our family belonged to labor class.
And in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor.  That gave birth to this belief in us that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.
To seek refuge from the hard labor, we wrote a letter to the editor of daily, Amroz, asking him to tell us what should we do after matriculation exams so that we don’t have to go through the strenuous physical labor.
The editor, replied that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for a list of subjects to study.
From the beginning, we were inclined towards engineering;  also in the Matriculations, we opted for technical drawing, instead of biology.
But, at the time of admission in FSC, my elder brother insisted upon doing FSC in Pre Medical to become a doctor.
We hardly studied Biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand anything, we swapped Biology for Mathematics.
It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs drove us to become engineers and now all we are some of the well-placed ones among many youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God.
We were not even thirty minutes into our working that our younger son said “Dad, it feels like I am not born for this job."
We said that if that is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.
Our younger son started saying, "I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work."
The three of us somehow managed to finish the job and get back home.
It means that when a man decides the destination, no matter what the motives were behind this, no one can stop him from getting it.

American high officials have stated that President Obama will take a stern attitude towards the Afghan President Hamid Karzai.
The new American strategy towards Afghanistan will focus on war instead of development.
The officials said that Hamid Karzai is viewed as an obstacle in achieving American interests in Afghanistan because of government corruption, a rise in drug trafficking, and the Taliban's increasing strength.
The Obama administration will work with provincial political leaders instead of the central government.
They said that they will ask Hamid Karzai to intensify the campaign against corruption.
