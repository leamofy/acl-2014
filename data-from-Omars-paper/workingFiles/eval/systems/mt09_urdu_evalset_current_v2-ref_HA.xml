<seg id="1">Bakhtawar's Tribute to Benazir in Song</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">A rap song (a style of modern music) recorded in Bakhtawar's voice has now even been posted on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="3">Benazir Bhutto's pictures and video clips are shown during the five-minute song.</seg>
<seg id="4">Eighteen-year-old Bakhtawar is a student of Edinburgh University.</seg>
<seg id="5">She has a deep interest in poetry and singing.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is said that apparently she started amateur singing after being encouraged by her mother.</seg>
<seg id="7">While paying tribute to her mother she says, "You were intelligent and beautiful; you did everything in the same style."</seg>
<seg id="8">About the incident of December 27, she says that she was shot near the temple, leaving us at the age of fifty-four and leaving three children behind.</seg>
<seg id="9">The entire nation has no hope without her and she is present in all of their heartbeats.</seg>
<seg id="10">Among Benazir's children, Bakhtawar is second after the twenty-year-old Bilawal Bhutto.</seg>
<seg id="11">She has been taking an interest in music since the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="12">It is said that before her mother's return to the country, she had expressed a wish to meet Grammy Award winner music producer and rapper Puff Daddy with the help of her journalist friend in America, but this meeting could not take place.</seg>
<seg id="13">Several Sindhi newspapers published a translation of Bakhtawar's poetry, but her voice is being heard for the first time through YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="14">Some of the workers and fans of Benazir Bhutto have started making CDs of Bakhtawar's rap song.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the other hand, Farhatullah Babar, the spokesperson of Pakistan People's Party, has confirmed that the poetry and voice in the song on YouTube is Bakhtawar's.</seg>
<seg id="16">On the phone from Islamabad he said that this is a tribute of a grief-stricken daughter to her courageous mother which has also been aired on Pakistan's official television network.</seg>
<seg id="17">Farhatullah Babar said that the program of distributing the CDs (etc.) of Bakhtawar's song has not yet been planned by his party.</seg>
<seg id="18">He said that a few months back a fake account of the young Chairman of his party, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, was created on the Facebook website, which was later closed.</seg>

<seg id="1">Rocket Fire from Lebanon; also Counter-bombing</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Officials of the Israeli army and the police have told media representatives that four rockets were launched at Israel from an area of Lebanon, one of which struck in the town of Nahariya in North Israel, causing two people to suffer minor injuries.</seg>
<seg id="3">In response to the rockets fired from the area of Lebanon, Israeli artillery bombed Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is not clear whether this was an attack by Hezbollah or if Palestinian groups active in Lebanon are behind it.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Lebanese government says that it is also trying to find out who is behind these rocket attacks.</seg>
<seg id="6">BBC's correspondent has declared this to be an extremely dangerous turn in the current crisis in the region.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to Jeremy Bowen, BBC's Middle East editor, these rocket attacks have intensified the threat of the war spreading.</seg>
<seg id="8">For the past few days, apprehension has been expressed that the activities in Gaza might spread northward to Israel's border with Lebanon.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, on Wednesday night, Israel's air force launched sixty air raids on the Gaza Strip.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the Israeli army, Hamas police offices, tunnels, arsenals, rocket launch pads, and armed forces of Hamas were targeted in these attacks.</seg>
<seg id="11">In addition to air raids, the Israeli army and navy artillery continued bombing Gaza all night.</seg>
<seg id="12">Palestinian sources said that a mosque was destroyed in the air raids on Gaza City.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to unconfirmed reports, Israeli army tanks, with air support from helicopters, have advanced toward the area of Khan Yunis.</seg>
<seg id="14">In this battle, which has continued for the past twelve days, nearly 700 Palestinians have been killed, including a large number of women and children.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the other side, 11 soldiers of the Israeli army have also been killed.</seg>
<seg id="16">Israeli security forces have confirmed that Amos Gilad, a top defense official, is going to Cairo to set the conditions for a ceasefire.</seg>
<seg id="17">A delegation from Hamas is also leaving for Cairo to have parallel talks with the ambassadors of Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="18">In addition, Mahmoud Abbas, leader of the Palestinian Authority, will arrive in Cairo on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="1">140-year-old, Nine-kilo Lobster, Freed</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">"George the Giant Lobster" had been caught in the sea two weeks ago.</seg>
<seg id="3">The city's seafood company had bought it for one hundred dollars</seg>
<seg id="4">and started using the lobster's pictures immediately for publicity.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, "PETA," a group working for animal protection, demanded the release of the lobster and now, as a result, it will be returned to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="6">George was caught from the sea in Canada, after which it spent ten days in the City Crab and Sea Food Company's tank.</seg>
<seg id="7">The age of a lobster can be estimated from its weight.</seg>
<seg id="8">Restaurant manager Keith Valenti says that he had no intention to harm the lobster, and the purpose of keeping it in the tank was to provide something of interest to customers.</seg>
<seg id="9">Ingrid Newkirk of the PETA animal safety organization says that the restaurant's decision is praiseworthy and an example for those who either want to keep such rare animals in a tank or boil them for eating.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police officials, an eighteen-inch diameter pipeline running from Loti Gas Field to Pir Koh has been ruptured by the explosion.</seg>
<seg id="3">This pipeline runs toward the Sui Plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">Meanwhile, a person by the name of Sarbaz Baloch, presenting himself as the spokesperson of the banned organization, the Baloch Republican Army, has accepted responsibility for the attack on behalf of his organization over the telephone.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is the fourth gas pipeline, which has been blown up in four days.</seg>
<seg id="6">On Friday in Dera Allah Yar, an eighteen-inch diameter pipeline was destroyed, repair of which was underway until Sunday morning.</seg>

<seg id="8">This pipeline comes to Quetta by way of Sibbi.</seg>

<seg id="1">Bitterness between Israeli President and Turkish Prime Minister</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Recep Tayyip Erdogan, almost screaming, told the Israeli President that the blood of many people has been shed in Gaza, and he was sorry to see that people can applaud the justification for Israel's invasion.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mr. Erdogan said, "It seems to me that perhaps you are speaking in such a way, even shouting, so as to remove your feeling of guilt, but you have killed people - and I am talking about those children who were killed near the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">Shimon Peres said that in Gaza it is Hamas, not Israel, who has established a dangerous dictatorship there.</seg>
<seg id="5">One BBC correspondent from Davos says that this kind of scene has never been witnessed before at the World Economic Forum.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, Erdogan said later that he respects the Israeli President and his age, as well, and this was not the reason he shouted at him, but rather because what he was saying was far from true.</seg>
<seg id="7">Turkey is among the few Islamic countries which have diplomatic relations with Israel, although for the past few years there has been tension between them.</seg>

<seg id="1">Financial Crisis: Billionaire German Industrialist's Suicide</seg>
</hl>
<seg id="2">Adolf Merckle of Southern Germany's Swabia area has left a large business group behind,</seg>
<seg id="3">but until some time ago the average German citizen did not know much about him.</seg>
<seg id="4">When he had to carry on negotiations for several weeks with the nearly thirty banks who lend money to his industrial group, he became the topic of headlines and began to see the future of the Merckle group as bleak.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Merckle group was forced to suffer millions of euros in losses due to the financial crisis, after purchasing shares of the German Volkswagen manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="6">So when financial institutions refused to make new loans of between 700 million and one billion euros to this group, which they desperately needed, Merckle came under intense pressure.</seg>
<seg id="7">Just recently the same banks had agreed to provide loans to the Merckle group on an emergency basis, but Adolf Merckle, who had moved from being a small industrialist to the position that his industrial group's annual income was approximately 30 billion euros, could not withstand the deprivation of his strength as a capitalist.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Adolf Merckle took charge of his family's business after the death of his father, he greatly improved the business very quickly through a process of modernization.</seg>
<seg id="9">He named his company "Ratiopharm," now the biggest and most successful pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until recently the company was worth between 5 and 6 billion euros, and it still generates an annual income of 8.1 billion euros. After the tremendous success of Ratiopharm, the Merckle group purchased several large institutions, including HeidelbergCement, a manufacturer of construction materials, and Kaessbohrer, a manufacturer of special vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="11">The number of Merckle Group employees worldwide is nearly 100,000, and the Ratiopharm pharmaceutical company has always held a special place amongst its assets.</seg>
<seg id="12">In his life Adolf Merckle had said on several occasions, "This is our fourth generation of drug manufacturers.</seg>
<seg id="13">Now this company's administration is with my children and I am hopeful that in the coming few hundred years it will remain under my family's administration."</seg>
<seg id="14">After the suicide of Adolf Merckle, banks approved a temporary loan of 400 million euros to his VEM group, but on the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that the group's financial situation can be improved over the long term.</seg>
<seg id="15">Thus after the death of Adolf Merckle, the Merckle group will not be the same as it used to be.</seg>

<seg id="2">In this respect it is not only the American public but the whole world that has various expectations from Obama.</seg>
<seg id="3">Now that Barack Obama is receiving congratulatory messages from all over the world on becoming the American president, the expectations of him are also becoming clear.</seg>
<seg id="4">In this regard, German Chancellor Angela Merkel has expressed confidence in the new American President.</seg>
<seg id="5">"I believe that based on the deep friendship and partnership between the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America, we can resolve current issues."</seg>
<seg id="6">Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says that Obama seems sober and open-hearted, and this definitely is a good thing.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even though former American President George W. Bush's policies have faced criticism,</seg>
<seg id="8">his administration is surely to be commended for the movement to get China to play a more constructive role on an international level, while China has said about the new American President that there will be a need to work towards strong military relations between the two countries.</seg>
<seg id="9">Chinese political expert Gosoi Wu, active in the German city of Bochum, says,</seg>
<seg id="10">"In this respect I am sure that in the coming weeks and months Obama and his economic team will apply great pressure, and force the Beijing government to set an exchange rate that is flexible and in accordance with the market for the Chinese currency."</seg>
<seg id="11">The former American administration has further strengthened the relations with India also.</seg>
<seg id="12">Where can Obama take these relations? Regarding this, New Delhi's Professor of American Studies Christopher Raj says, "Now we have come closer in a strategic partnership but Obama cannot make any change overnight."</seg>
<seg id="13">Pope Benedict has also emphasized promoting the atmosphere of peace and cooperation in the world in his message for Obama.</seg>
