   </hl>
    <seg id="2">The committee's meeting was held on Friday at the Parliament House under the chairmanship of Committee Chairman Mushahid Hussain. The Committee proposed to the government to send a parliamentary delegation comprised of represenatives of all parties to Palestine, in addition to sending relief items.</seg>
    <seg id="3">Talking to media representatives after the meeting, Mushahid Hussain Syed said that the Committee welcomed the French proposal, which urged Israel to announce an immediate ceasefire and allow access for relief activities in the war-torn areas of Gaza.</seg>
    <seg id="4">While terming the Israeli attacks on the Palestinians as crimes against humanity, he said that all countries should condemn these attacks.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Criticizing the double-standards of the world nations, Mushahid Hussain asked why countries that speak out against terrorism are silent about the Israeli strikes on the Palestinians.</seg>
    <seg id="6">The Senate Chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs also criticized the lukewarm reaction of Muslim leaders regarding the Palestinian issue.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He said that the Committee expressed hope that newly-elected US President Barack Obama would address the Muslim community in the first 100 days after taking office in order to bridge the gap between the Muslim world and the United States.</seg>
    <seg id="8">He said that not only should urgent steps be taken to bridge the gap between the Muslim world and the West, but festering issues like Palestine and Kashmir should also be resolved.</seg>

    <seg id="10">The emergency meeting of the Committee was convened to discuss the Israeli offensive against Palestine. He said that the Committee is aware of the Palestinian issue and that the government is in contact with world leaders in this regard.</seg>

   </hl>
    <seg id="2">This study of US scientists is the result of tests carried out on mice.</seg>
    <seg id="3">The research found that mice fed with a low-calorie diet had relatively weaker immune systems for fighting off the flu virus.</seg>
    <seg id="4">The research has disproven the "starve a fever" adage.</seg>
    <seg id="5">According to the scientists, one should eat well when suffering from a fever.</seg>
    <seg id="6">According to researchers at Michigan State University, mice fed with a calorie-restricted diet were less able to fight off infection and were more likely to die, while mice fed with a routine diet had more of an immunity against the flu virus.</seg>
    <seg id="7">According to Professor Elizabeth Gardner, people on diets will not only be more likely to catch the flu virus, but they will also take longer to recover.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Gardner was of the view that those who have received the flu vaccine should avoid dieting during the winter.</seg>

     <seg id="1">'First nuclear test conducted in 1990'</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reed, who has worked as a weapons designer at Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, has written a book in collaboration with Danny Stillman, former director of the technical intelligence division at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</seg>
    <seg id="3">In their book, 'The Nuclear Express: A Political History of the Bomb and its Proliferation,' Reed and Stillman claim that every country that has ever produced a nuclear bomb has been able to do so because it stole the nuclear secrets of another country or enjoyed the cooperation of another nuclear power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">In an interview with US News and World Report, Reed alleged that it was China who conducted the first nuclear test for Pakistan in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's first term in office.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Thomas Reed said that he was sure that China had conducted Pakistan's nuclear testing for several reasons.</seg>
    <seg id="6">These reasons included the design of the bomb and information gathered in interviews with Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He added that this was why Pakistan was able to conduct nuclear testing in 1998 just two weeks and three days after India's nuclear explosions.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Reed recalled that in 1961, the former Soviet Union had conducted a surprise nuclear test and the United States took 17 days to respond, despite the fact that it had possessed nuclear bombs for a long time.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He added that the bomb that Pakistan tested in 1998 was made with extreme care and Pakistani scientists had complete trust in its effectiveness.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Reed was asked if China had also provided Pakistan with nuclear technology, he replied that India was the common enemy of both Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that there was evidence that Dr Abdul Qadir Khan had used the Chinese model, a fact that was later confirmed by documents from Libya.</seg>
    <seg id="12">In response to another question, whether conducting joint nuclear testing was a routine occurrence, he said that the United States openly carried out nuclear tests for Britain in the Nevada desert in 1990.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He added that Israel was presumably given access to the results of these tests.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Reed was also asked whether China was continuing its nuclear proliferation program.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Reed responded that China had provided the raw materials, instructions and design for the nuclear installation at Isfahan in 1991.</seg>
    <seg id="16">China has also provided Iran with its enrichment plant at Kherej.</seg>
    <seg id="17">Reed added that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Jordan through North Korea.</seg>

    <seg id="10">Bruce Springsteen was fourth, with $166 million, while The Police came in fifth, with $120.6 million.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The publication said that fewer people went to concerts in North America during 2008, and those who did venture out had to pay higher prices for their tickets than ever before.</seg>
    <seg id="12">The average price of concert tickets in the US rose by 8%. A top-tier ticket to one of Madonna's shows costs $350.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Pollstar editor Gary Bongiovanni said that 2008 proved to be a good year for singers despite a backdrop of global recession.</seg>

    <seg id="2">Journalists and media workers from newspapers and TV channels held a protest demonstration in front of the Islamabad Press Club on Tuesday under the leadership of RIUJ, an organization of Islamabad-based journalists, to protest the sacking of a large number of employees from newspapers and TV channels. The participants were chanting slogans.</seg>
    <seg id="3">Addressing the protesters, CR Shamsi, a senior member of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, the main representative organization of journalists in Pakistan, said that Pakistani politicians, who were on the streets protesting alongside the journalists a few days back, were doing nothing for journalists' rights now that they were in the corridors of power, adding that they were in fear of newspaper owners and a particular unspecified group.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Shamsi said that newspaper owners who pay lip service to human rights have turned their organizations into torture cells and concentration camps, and despite earning billions of rupees every year, media organizations were employing workers on extremely low salaries while hundreds were being sacked, thus committing financial murder.</seg>

    <seg id="6">In reality, the EU is emanating an embarrassing image of indecisiveness and conflict.</seg>

    <seg id="9">On the other hand, there is the former French president of the EU, who would have liked nothing more than to continue his term as EU president.</seg>

    <seg id="2">Adolf Merckle, who lived in Swabia, an area of Southern Germany, has left behind a vast business group.</seg>
    <seg id="3">But until fairly recently, most Germans didn't know much about him.</seg>
    <seg id="4">He became the subject of headlines when he had to negotiate with nearly 30 banks to provide loans to his industrial group and realized that the Merckle Group was doomed.</seg>
    <seg id="5">He lost massive amounts of money after a speculative investment in Volkswagen shares went the wrong way, and lost several million Euros due to the financial crisis.</seg>
    <seg id="6">And when banks refused to provide him the 700 to 1 billion Euro loan that was crucial to his group's survival, he came under further pressure.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Earlier, these same banks had agreed to provide loans to the Merckle Group on an emergency basis, and Adolf Merckle, who had risen from being a small industrialist to leading a group with an annual income of 30 billion Euros, could not bear the collapse of his industrial empire.</seg>
    <seg id="8">After taking charge of the family business following his father's death, Adolf Merckle developed it along modern lines and saw it flourish.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He named his company Ratiopharm, which is now a leading pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
    <seg id="10">The pharmaceutical company's dividends rose to 5-6 billion Euros, yet it still earned an annual profit of 8.1 billion Euros. After Ratiopharm's success, the Merckle Group purchased shares of major corporations, including HeidelbergCement and car manufacturer Kaessbohrer.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The Merckle Group employs around 100,000 people worldwide and Ratiopharm also plays a vital role for the Group's finances.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Adolf Merckle had said: "Our family has been involved in the production of medicines for four generations.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Now this company is being managed by my sons, and I hope that it will remain in the family for centuries to come."</seg>
    <seg id="14">Korassio farm will have to be sold to improve the Group's long term financial condition. A bridge loan of 400 million Euros was approved for VEM, but it came through only after Merckle's death.</seg>

    <seg id="7">On the first day of his presidency, Obama has begun making good on his election promises and has consciously taken steps to make the affairs of his administration transparent.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Analysts are of the view that the efforts of the US President are aimed at saving America's deteriorating image in the world, but it will be extremely difficult for him to succeed in this task, because as long as the US continues to support the oppressive Israeli regime, nothing good can come of it. If the United States wants to save its reputation in the international community, it will have to end its support of Israel and refuse to be a partner in its crimes.</seg>

    <seg id="7">General Kapoor said that political leadership makes decisions dealing with matters related to war or peace.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Referring to the alleged presence of terrorist infrastructure on Pakistani soil, he said that India would confront any elements that are determined to disturb the peace and weaken India.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He said that about 700-800 militants are present in Indian-held Kashmir, of which 50 per cent are foreigners.</seg>
    <seg id="10">General Deepak Kapoor said that, with the change in weather, infiltration from Pakistan and its part of Kashmir could increase. However, India has increased monitoring on the border.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He rejected the possibility of a reduction in Indian troop presence in Indian-held Kashmir, saying that national security cannot be compromised.</seg>

     <seg id="2">We should ponder it and decide our path and follow it, thanks.</seg>
     <seg id="3">There is no doubt that most of the members of Jamat-ud-dawa are comprised of Lashkar-e-Taiba cadets who joined the newly formed Jamat-ud-dawa after the Pakistani government banned Lashkar-e-Taiba.</seg>
     <seg id="4">However, even though these cadets prefer social work, under strong pressure from India the United Nations also banned the group and the Pakistani government initiated crackdowns against them.</seg>

     <seg id="6">The MQM is an ally of the government, the Muslim League (N) is supporting it from behind, and the Muslim League (Q) is the party which will get the 17th Amendment passed. Then how it is possible that these parties are sincere about abolishing the 17th Amendment?</seg>

     <seg id="10">The 17th Amendment cannot be abolished as long as Zardari is there.</seg>
     <seg id="11">This is what majority of us said in a survey, and this only is true.</seg>
     <seg id="12">If the 17th Amendment had been abolished, Zardari would have never become President.</seg>
     <seg id="13">Now he is more powerful than Pervez Musharraf because he is not only the President but also the Chairman of People's Party.</seg>
     <seg id="14">As long as he is the President, the 17th Amendment will remain intact.</seg>
     <seg id="15">To abolish the 17th Amendment, political parties will have to remove President Zardari from the Presidential House first.</seg>

     <seg id="1">Most of our ancestors belonged to the labor class,</seg>
     <seg id="2">and in our childhood, when we used to see our uncles and maternal uncles selling things on handcarts, we would pray to Allah to save us from physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="3">To save us from that, we wrote a letter to the editor of Daily Imroz and asked as to what one should do after Metric to be saved from physical labor.</seg>
     <seg id="4">The editor replied that we should become a doctor or an engineer, and suggested a few subjects.</seg>
     <seg id="5">As it is, we were interested in engineering, and we passed our Metric exams in technical drawing, not biology.</seg>
     <seg id="6">But when we went to take admission in FSC, my elder brother forced us to take admission in medical FSC and become a doctor.</seg>
     <seg id="7">We hardly studied biology for a month, and when we couldn't understand, we exchanged it for mathematics.</seg>
     <seg id="8">That means, fear from physical labor had made us engineers, and now we are in a much better position in our family and we thank Allah for that.</seg>
     <seg id="9">We realized this while we were laying a carpet in our old house with our two young sons.</seg>
     <seg id="10">We were into the work for about half an hour when my younger son said, "Dad, we are not born to do this it seems."</seg>
     <seg id="11">We said, "If it is true, then study hard like us and keep away from physical labor."</seg>
     <seg id="12">The son said, "I am studying and will study but I cannot do this work."</seg>
     <seg id="13">We finished that work somehow in three hours.</seg>

     <seg id="2">On the one hand, Benazeer had arranged the list of Sikhs who were fighting for their freedom in India, and suppressed their movement, and on the other hand, she had given India a chance after suppressing the Punjab movement in order to concentrate on Kashmir.</seg>
     <seg id="3">The rift of power between Benazeer and Nawaz Shareef is a part of history that has pushed the country many years back.</seg>
     <seg id="4">During her banishment, Benazeer continued to give statements against Kashmir and the nuclear program.</seg>
     <seg id="5">Benazeer had dealt with General Musharraf, dishonoring his agreement with Nawaz Shareef in London.</seg>
     <seg id="6">Benazeer, during his tenure, allowed her husband to earn much money. This has earned him the name of Mr. Ten Percent.</seg>
     <seg id="7">Her brother was killed when she was in power, and his assassins are still at large.</seg>
     <seg id="8">Being a woman, Benazeer never raised her voice about women's rights.</seg>

     <seg id="1">One year of army action has passed in the disturbed border province of Swat, and the situation is going from bad to worse.</seg>
     <seg id="2">On the one hand, the government is limited in this area to repeating to move a condemnation writ in the national assembly, and on the other hand, Taliban's illegal FM Radio is enjoying immense popularity in Swat.</seg>
     <seg id="3">Thirdly, common citizens find it fit to obey the one who is practically in charge of this area.</seg>
     <seg id="4">In Swat, during the operations of security forces, they claimed to kill ..... fundamentals through their gunship helicopters and cannons, but despite these killings, the Taliban is not only becoming stronger but, according to an estimate, are practically ruling eighty percent of Swat.</seg>
     <seg id="5">The result is, while the government is not ready to accept its defeat, the Taliban is well established there.</seg>
     <seg id="6">Who is caught between the line of fire? Poor citizens.</seg>
     <seg id="7">In Swat, it is now said, someone asked what kind of people are Taliban. Another answered, very good, because they are the custodians of religion and fight against the 'enemies of Allah and religion.'</seg>

     <seg id="3">Heavenly Swat is called the Switzerland of Pakistan.</seg>
     <seg id="4">As per the government's strategy, talks are in progress at the same time force is also being used.</seg>
     <seg id="5">But the use of force is only increasing the power of the Taliban; there is a sympathy among the people for them, but there is no benefit beyond it.</seg>
     <seg id="6">The need of the hour is to use no force, but to finish the root cause of it.</seg>

     <seg id="2">The proposed Sharia Bill by ANP will solve the problems of Swat to a large extent.</seg>
     <seg id="3">But with the implementation of Sharia law, the government should also pay heed to financial problems.</seg>
     <seg id="4">The initial steps taken by General Musharraf started to give one a feeling that the nation will now get rid of these inefficient politicians, but his greed for power has changed all of his aspirations.</seg>
     <seg id="5">He started to think of himself as invincible after joining "The War On Terror," doing whatever was expected.</seg>
     <seg id="6">And the measures that were expected, shattered.</seg>
     <seg id="7">As Bush's tenure came to an end, he also became worried about the end of his government and quickly dealt with thieves.</seg>
     <seg id="8">Even after that, General Musharraf could have controlled the army, but who knows what is happening with the present government?</seg>
     <seg id="9">Whether it is Bajod or Swat, the government is not controlling terror, but rather bombarding its "enemies"; this not only damages property, but also makes the "enemy" a mental patient. Then, only we are their enemies.</seg>

     <seg id="3">Addressing a chief ministers' meeting in New Delhi, Manmohan Singh said that the neighboring countries, especially Pakistan, are supporting fundamentalist elements.</seg>
     <seg id="4">Mumbai terrorist attackers used a sea route, and were safe from the Indian Coast Guard.</seg>
     <seg id="5">The Indian Prime Minister said that Lashkar had conducted the November Mumbai attack.</seg>
     <seg id="6">He further said that terrorists are using new and modern communication systems, and that we should beef up our security at the line of control to stop infiltration. He said that terrorism can not be tolerated at any cost, and this is our policy.</seg>
