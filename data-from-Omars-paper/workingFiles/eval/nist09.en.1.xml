   </hl>
    <seg id="2">The Committee meeting was held in Parliament House on Friday under the direction of Committee Chairman Mushahid Hussain Sayed, wherein it was recommended to the government that, in addition to sending relief supplies, it should also send a parliamentary delegation of the representatives of all political parties to Palestine.</seg>
    <seg id="3">After the meeting, Mushahid Hussain Sayed, while talking to the representative of the media, said the Committee has welcomed France's recommendation that Israel immediately call a ceasefire and permit relief activities for victims in Gaza.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Declaring Israel's attack on Palestinians a crime against humanity, he said that all countries should condemn these attacks.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Targeting his criticism against their double standard, Mushahid Hussain questioned the silence of those who speak out against terrorism about Israel's attacks on Palestinians.</seg>
    <seg id="6">The Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs also criticized the apathetic behavior of Muslim leaders on the problem in Palestine.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He said that the committee is hopeful that the newly elected American president Barack Obama will address the Muslim world during his first 100 days in office so that the gulf between America and the Muslim world can be bridged.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Mushahid Hussain Sayed said that, not only should emergency steps be taken to fill the gap between the Muslim world and the West, but also old problems like those of Kashmir and Palestine should also be solved.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Malik Amad Khan, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, told the Committee that he is going to Saudi Arabia to attend the meeting of foreign ministers for the Organization of Islamic Countries.</seg>

     <seg id="1">Avoiding Dieting Can Prevent Flu</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">This finding by American scientists has emerged as a result of experiments performed on rats.</seg>
    <seg id="3">The experiments proved that the ability to combat the flu virus was lower in rats who were kept on a low-calorie diet.</seg>
    <seg id="4">This research has proven wrong the old saying that "while suffering from fever, it is better to abstain from eating."</seg>
    <seg id="5">According to scientists, it is better to eat and drink a lot during a fever.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Researchers from Michigan State University say that rats on a low diet were found to have less ability to fight off infection and an increased chance of mortality, while rats on a normal diet had greater resistance against the flu virus.</seg>
    <seg id="7">According to Professor Elizabeth Gardner, people on a diet will not only succumb quickly to the flu, but will also take longer to recover.</seg>
    <seg id="8">She also says that even people who have taken the flu vaccine should avoid dieting during the winter months.</seg>

     <seg id="1">First Nuclear Test Done in 1990</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Thomas Reed, who has worked as a weapon designer in America's Liver National Laboratory, wrote this book in cooperation with Danny Stillman, former Director of Technical Intelligence at Los Alamos National Laboratory.</seg>
    <seg id="3">In the book, entitled "Nuclear Express: The Political History and Spread of the Bomb," both writers have claimed that any country that has made an atomic bomb has either stolen nuclear secrets from another country or has done so with the support of another nuclear power.</seg>
    <seg id="4">During one of the interviews with US News, Thomas Reed said that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb in 1990, during the time of Benazir Bhutto.</seg>
    <seg id="5">He said that his belief that China tested Pakistan's first nuclear bomb is based on several reasons,</seg>
    <seg id="6">including the design of the bomb and information collected from conversations with Chinese scientists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">He said that this is why Pakistan was able to respond in 1998 to India's nuclear test with their own test only two weeks and three days later.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Thomas Reed reminded the interviewer how, when Russia conducted a nuclear test in 1961, America responded with its own test only 17 days later, despite the fact that it had had the bomb for quite some time.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He added that the nuclear bomb, which Pakistan tested in May 1998, was very carefully made and Pakistani scientists had full confidence in it.</seg>
    <seg id="10">When Thomas Reed was asked why China would provide Pakistan with nuclear technology, he responded that it is because India is a common enemy to both Pakistan and China.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that there is evidence that Dr. Abdul Qadir Khan used the Chinese design, and that this was later verified through documents acquired from Libya.</seg>
    <seg id="12">When asked whether it is common for countries to collaborate in nuclear testing, he gave the example of how America expressly conducted a nuclear test for Britain in 1990 in the Nevada desert.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He said they also speculate that Israel was provided access to the results of this test.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Reed was also asked whether China has plans for continued nuclear expansion.</seg>
    <seg id="15">He responded that China has been providing raw materials, guidelines, and designs for nuclear installation in the Iranian city of Isfahan since 1991,</seg>
    <seg id="16">and has provided Iran with a production plant in Karaj.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He said that China has been providing nuclear technology to Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt, Libya and Yemen through North Korea.</seg>

   </hl>
    <seg id="2">The show was based on Madonna's album "Hard Candy" and featured a band of Ukrainian gypsies, or nomads, as well as a duet with Justin Timberlake.</seg>
    <seg id="3">An old racing car was also placed onstage.</seg>
    <seg id="4">It was the most profitable show since that of Celine Dion in 2008, bringing in $236.6 million.</seg>
    <seg id="5">While the Canadian show "Taking Chances" visited twenty-four countries, Madonna went to only seventeen countries as part of her first world tour in the last eight years.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Both singers' shows were directed by Jamie King, who had also organized the Spice Girls' "Reunion" tour.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Madonna broke her own previous record set in 2006.</seg>
    <seg id="8">In 2006, she had earned $193.7 million from the "Confession" concerts.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Pollster declared Bon Jovi to be the third most successful singer, earning $176 million.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Bruce Springsteen came in fourth, earning $166 million, and the Police in fifth, with $120.6 million.</seg>
    <seg id="11">According to Pollster, very few people attended concerts and vocal performances in North America in 2008; only those who were able to buy the expensive tickets.</seg>
    <seg id="12">In America, the average ticket price increased by eight percent, and the highest-priced ticket for Madonna's show sold for $350.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Pollster's editor Gary Bongiovanni said that, taking into account the global economic slump, 2008 proved to be a good year for singers.</seg>
    <seg id="14">He has predicted that 2009 will be a good year for U2 and Springsteen, whose albums are soon to be released.</seg>

    <seg id="3">The pamphlet states that if co-ed institutions are not shut down by January 5, then action will be taken against them.</seg>
    <seg id="4">It also states that identity cards may not be issued to women for government assistance or any other educational purposes, and women are forbidden to go to the NADRA offices in all tehsils.</seg>
    <seg id="5">This announcement forbidding the issuance of identity cards has been made at a time when approximately 200 women have submitted application forms at the NADRA offices to have their identity cards issued for the Benazir Income Support Program in North Waziristan.</seg>
    <seg id="6">According to the local people, the Taliban's pamphlet was read over the loudspeakers of all mosques in North Waziristan.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Nevertheless, it was not stated in writing whether separate educational institutions for girls will be banned or not.</seg>
    <seg id="8">According to the pamphlet, if any woman is caught trying to get an education from school or her identity card from a NADRA office after this announcement, she and her family will be punished by religious law.</seg>

    <seg id="4">He said that the owners of newspaper who talk about human rights have made their organizations into torture chambers and beggar camps where they pay the workers extremely low wages and financially murder hundreds by firing them, despite earning billions of rupees each year for themselves.</seg>
    <seg id="5">The example before us is that of a worker of private TV Channel Five in Lahore who had committed suicide after not being paid for four months; even today, many workers are living under duress due to forced dismissal and not receiving their salaries for months.</seg>
    <seg id="6">He said that direct steps should be taken against TV and newspaper owners and a permanent protest camp needs to be set up before the Parliament for the rights of journalists.</seg>
    <seg id="7">C. R. Shamsi, criticizing Governor of Punjab Salman Taseer, said that employees are being dismissed from his Urdu newspaper "Aaj Kal" without any notice.</seg>
    <seg id="8">As Daily Jinnah, Daily Khabrein, Channel Five, Business Plus TV, and Aaj TV have fired dozens of employees,</seg>
    <seg id="9">Mazhar Abbas, Secretary General of PUFJ, said, when speaking to demonstrators, that today, throughout the country, journalist organizations are celebrating Black Day against the firing of journalists and newspaper workers, while the journalists will go to the Parliament session to fight for their rights with black bands tied on their arms.</seg>
    <seg id="10">According to Mazhar Abbas, the workers and journalists are being exploited in eighty-five percent of Pakistan's newspapers and TV channels, where they are working without any contract.</seg>
    <seg id="11">He said that until now, more than 200 journalists and workers have been dismissed from newspapers and TV channels, while it is feared that during the current year, owners will dismiss hundreds more, justifying this on the basis of the economic crisis.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Mazhar Abbas said that the journalists' movement will continue until the workers who were fired are reinstated, the Seventh Wage Board Award that fixes the wages of newspaper workers is implemented, and the salaries of workers of TV channels and newspapers are paid, which have been withheld for months.</seg>

    <seg id="8">Wajid Shamsul Hassan said, "So far the investigators have concluded that nothing took place on Pakistani soil.</seg>
    <seg id="9">It could be any other place, with the exception of Britain.</seg>
    <seg id="10">These two places (Pakistan and Britain) were the ones that I was worried about."</seg>
    <seg id="11">India and the international community have put a lot of pressure on Pakistan to take action against those responsible for the Mumbai attacks. Pakistan says it has taken dozens of people into custody in its actions against groups allegedly involved in the Mumbai attacks.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Wajid Shamsul Hassan said, "We are not trying to cover it up.</seg>
    <seg id="13">We believe in taking action based on facts.</seg>

    <seg id="2">When viewed from an official standpoint, the role of the European Union in the conciliatory efforts to stop the war in the Middle East is decisive.</seg>
    <seg id="3">According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg's delegation or Sarkozy's efforts are the equivalent to lending a helping hand.</seg>
    <seg id="4">Amadeu Altafaj, spokesperson for the European Commission, said that every effort by which the European Commission's concerted message can be sent to warring parties is praiseworthy.</seg>
    <seg id="5">As far as its official statement is concerned, everything looks fine.</seg>
    <seg id="6">But in reality the European Union is presenting a sad picture of its own internal tug-of-war.</seg>
    <seg id="7">As Union President, the role of the Czech Republic has already been weak.</seg>
    <seg id="8">On top of that, internal disputes have rendered it helpless.</seg>
    <seg id="9">On the other hand, French President Sarkozy is acting as though he is still performing the presidential duties of the European Union.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Even though France has completed its six-month presidential term.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play a leadership role, and he is certainly capable, but he does not have the permission to do so.</seg>
    <seg id="12">French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner is faced with the most ludicrous situation.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He is included in the delegation led by Czech Republic's Foreign Minister Schwarzenberg.</seg>
    <seg id="14">However, both Foreign Ministers are making different statements about the war in the Middle East.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend itself, while Kouchner thinks that this war cannot be called one of self-defense. Meanwhile Germany has also sent its own special envoy to the Middle East. Until the European Union demonstrates harmony by taking a united stand, it cannot achieve success on the diplomatic front.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Evidence of this is Israel's conduct, which does not show any respect for Europe's conciliatory efforts.</seg>

     <seg id="1">Financial Crisis: Billionaire German Industrialist's Suicide</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Adolf Merckle of Southern Germany's Swabia area has left a large business group behind,</seg>
    <seg id="3">but until some time ago the average German citizen did not know much about him.</seg>
    <seg id="4">When he had to carry on negotiations for several weeks with the nearly thirty banks who lend money to his industrial group, he became the topic of headlines and began to see the future of the Merckle group as bleak.</seg>
    <seg id="5">The Merckle group was forced to suffer millions of euros in losses due to the financial crisis, after purchasing shares of the German Volkswagen manufacturer.</seg>
    <seg id="6">So when financial institutions refused to make new loans of between 700 million and one billion euros to this group, which they desperately needed, Merckle came under intense pressure.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Just recently the same banks had agreed to provide loans to the Merckle group on an emergency basis, but Adolf Merckle, who had moved from being a small industrialist to the position that his industrial group's annual income was approximately 30 billion euros, could not withstand the deprivation of his strength as a capitalist.</seg>
    <seg id="8">When Adolf Merckle took charge of his family's business after the death of his father, he greatly improved the business very quickly through a process of modernization.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He named his company "Ratiopharm," now the biggest and most successful pharmaceutical company in Germany.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Until recently the company was worth between 5 and 6 billion euros, and it still generates an annual income of 8.1 billion euros. After the tremendous success of Ratiopharm, the Merckle group purchased several large institutions, including HeidelbergCement, a manufacturer of construction materials, and Kaessbohrer, a manufacturer of special vehicles.</seg>
    <seg id="11">The number of Merckle Group employees worldwide is nearly 100,000, and the Ratiopharm pharmaceutical company has always held a special place amongst its assets.</seg>
    <seg id="12">In his life Adolf Merckle had said on several occasions, "This is our fourth generation of drug manufacturers.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Now this company's administration is with my children and I am hopeful that in the coming few hundred years it will remain under my family's administration."</seg>
    <seg id="14">After the suicide of Adolf Merckle, banks approved a temporary loan of 400 million euros to his VEM group, but on the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that the group's financial situation can be improved over the long term.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Thus after the death of Adolf Merckle, the Merckle group will not be the same as it used to be.</seg>

    <seg id="2">According to recent statistics, between 2004 and 2007 the crime rate of foreigners</seg>
    <seg id="3">decreased from 22.9 percent</seg>
    <seg id="4">to 21.4 percent.</seg>
    <seg id="5">According to Joachim Herrmann, Interior Minister of the Bavarian Province, this only appears to be a positive change.</seg>
    <seg id="6">He said, "It is necessary to keep in mind that the number of foreigners obtaining German citizenship is increasing.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Therefore, when presenting the statistics, this fact should also be made clear that even when the criminal is a German citizen, his background may be foreign.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Herrmann said that in 2010 his province will take this into account when collecting data about criminals.</seg>
    <seg id="9">In addition to Bavaria, thinking is being done along the same lines in the province of Hamburg.</seg>
    <seg id="10">CDU's Senator of Internal Affairs Christoph Ahlhaus said, "When research is conducted in a scientific manner, one cannot draw up the results he would like to see ahead of time; they must depend on the data that emerges from the research.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Ahlhaus directed attention towards an analytical report from the provincial office of crime prevention prepared in 2006 in which the percentage of foreigners' involvement in crime was studied in the Bergedorf borough of the city of Hamburg.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Results showed that here</seg>
    <seg id="13">the rate of crimes committed by foreigners is less than the crime rate for the entire province.</seg>
    <seg id="14">In contrast, when the crime rate amongst adolescents was studied in 2006 in Berlin, it was seen that the rate of adolescents with foreign background was</seg>
    <seg id="15">44.7 percent.</seg>

   </hl>
    <seg id="2">New research has found that drinking three cups of tea daily</seg>
    <seg id="3">decreases the risk of breast cancer in women under 50 years of age by more than a third.</seg>
    <seg id="4">This research conducted in the American state of Florida's Moffitt Cancer Center has found that for women less than 50 years of age, the risk of breast cancer tumors</seg>
    <seg id="5">is decreased by up to 37 percent in those who drink at least three cups of tea daily.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Research has also found that drinking three or more cups of tea daily does not hold any particular benefit in this respect for elderly women.</seg>
    <seg id="7">Experts think that the reason for this is the presence in tea of some ingredients that are more effective against those particular cancerous tumors that most commonly occur in women under fifty years of age.</seg>
    <seg id="8">In Florida state's Moffitt Cancer Center in the city of Tampa, this research was conducted on more than 5,000 women who had been treated for breast cancer.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Their ages were between 20 and 74 years.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles to women who did not have breast cancer.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Experts also found that on a special type of cancer, lobular, tea had a significant effect, causing as much as 66 percent decrease.</seg>
    <seg id="12">Almost one in ten breast cancer patients has this type.</seg>
    <seg id="13">This type of cancer is more dangerous because it is deep and is commonly discovered after it has already spread a lot.</seg>
    <seg id="14">Experts say that by regularly drinking at least three cups of tea everyday the risk of breast cancer can be lowered significantly in young women.</seg>
    <seg id="15">They say that including tea as an everyday drink in your everyday routine creates adequate immunity in the body against cancer.</seg>

     <seg id="2">New Research</seg>
   </hl>
    <seg id="3">Exercise is good for the health at every age.</seg>
    <seg id="4">It makes your heart stronger, lowers cholesterol levels, helps in keeping weight low, helps prevent diabetes, and slows down the progress of Alzheimer's or senility.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Unfortunately, in many people the ability to exercise decreases as age increases.</seg>
    <seg id="6">Experts say that exercise keeps our body and mind alert, although age can have an effect on this.</seg>
    <seg id="7">The American Medical Association says that not exercising can lead to several health problems.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Dr. Patricia Pellikka of the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota says that increased age is a big reason behind an inability to exercise and a decrease in the body's performance.</seg>
    <seg id="9">Doctor Patricia teaches medicine at the Mayo Clinic.</seg>
    <seg id="10">She headed a study about heart disease and the ability of humans to exercise in old age.</seg>
    <seg id="11">A team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to examine the performance of the heart</seg>
    <seg id="12">in which the heart's pumping of blood, its phases of contraction and relaxation, was observed.</seg>
    <seg id="13">Experts have focused their attention on the left side of the heart, the side which pumps the blood.</seg>
    <seg id="14">They found that an increase in age is accompanied by an increase in problems in the relaxation phase of the heart.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Dr. Patricia says that with increased age the problems in the relaxation phase of the heart become prominent and their effect on the ability to exercise gets worse.</seg>
    <seg id="16">Dr. Garvan Kane was a part of this study.</seg>
    <seg id="17">He says that "we were surprised to see that this thing has a compulsory effect, which explained how much a poor performance in exercise can be related to the relaxation phase of the heart."</seg>
    <seg id="18">Many times blood pressure can become a cause for problems in the functioning of the heart and heart diseases.</seg>
    <seg id="19">If doctor and patient work together to deal with heart problems, they can still benefit from exercise in spite of increasing age.</seg>

    <seg id="4">He made this remark in Sri Nagar while speaking with reporters.</seg>
    <seg id="5">The Indian Army Chief was on a one-day tour of the Valley of Kashmir to examine Kashmir's overall defensive situation, which is under management by New Delhi and the readiness of armed forces on the borders.</seg>
    <seg id="6">He was questioned whether he has any comment about how, according to media reports, Pakistan has rejected the evidence presented from India regarding the Mumbai attacks.</seg>
    <seg id="7">General Kapoor said that decisions regarding matters of war and peace are made by the political leadership.</seg>
    <seg id="8">Allegedly mentioning the specter of terrorism being present in the land of Pakistan, he said that the Indian Army will be competing against those elements that are determined to upset peace and weaken India.</seg>
    <seg id="9">He said that in Indian Kashmir there are up to seven to eight hundred militants, of which approximately fifty percent are foreigners.</seg>
    <seg id="10">General Deepak Kapoor said that only with an improvement in weather can infiltration efforts can be increased by Pakistan and the part of Kashmir under its control; however, India has increased vigilance on the borders.</seg>

     <seg id="11">And the bad news is that the company's plane drowned in this financial crisis.</seg>
     <seg id="12">Watching this, I went to New Jersey via the West Side Highway, even when I saw that the southbound lane was closed, so what did I do?</seg>

     <seg id="6">In the crime world too, instead of taking the risk of robbing a bank, the information from a credit card is hacked.</seg>
     <seg id="7">Similarly, now there are even ways of making friends through computers.</seg>
     <seg id="8">Social networking websites like Orkut, Facebook, and Myspace rank highest in terms of popularity.</seg>
     <seg id="9">But don't you think that the more we comply with these social networking sites, the more we are getting distanced from people on a practical level?</seg>
     <seg id="10">There are even match-making websites, where your preferences are matched with the preferences of other people and the list of those compatible with you is provided.</seg>
