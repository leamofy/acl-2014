   </hl>
    <seg id="2">Officially European Union plays a decisive role in the mediatory efforts taken for stopping the war in Middle East.</seg>
    <seg id="3">According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of Sarkozy are helping hands in this process.</seg>
    <seg id="4">European Union spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said every single step which may help in delivering the conjoint message of European Union to fighting parties is appreciable.</seg>
    <seg id="5">Officially everything seems fine.</seg>
    <seg id="6">But in fact European Union is portraying a picture of internal tension, stress and strain.</seg>
    <seg id="7">The role of Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak</seg>
    <seg id="8">plus internal affairs has made her helpless.</seg>
    <seg id="9">On the other hand the course of action of French President Sarkozy depicts that France is still the President of European Union.</seg>
    <seg id="10">Although 6 months Presidency tenure of France is over.</seg>
    <seg id="11">Sarkozy wants to play a leading role which he is capable of, but he isn't the authority.</seg>
    <seg id="12">French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner is facing the funniest side.</seg>
    <seg id="13">He is in the delegation which is led by Schwarzenberg the Foreign Minister of Czech Republic.</seg>
    <seg id="14">In addition to that, the two foreign ministers are giving different statements on the war in Middle East.</seg>
    <seg id="15">Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right to defend herself, while according to Kouchner war is not the defense. Germany has also sent a special ambassador to Middle East. As long as European Union does not show unanimous stand, she can not be successful on diplomatic front.</seg>
    <seg id="16">The prove is the no lift conduct of Israel to mediatory efforts of European Union.</seg>
    <seg id="17">This is the best time for European Union to prove herself, as America has failed in Middle East due to the policies of George W. Bush.</seg>

     <seg id="1">Terrorist attacks should be condemned to the maximum, whether they are on the Mumbai Hotel or the Marriot Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine.</seg>
     <seg id="2">Similarly, terrorists should be hunted down irrespective of their nationality and whether they are Pakistani, Indian, American or Israeli.</seg>
     <seg id="3">Now the question is that every day terrorist attacks take place in Pakistan, hundreds of people die but the Pakistani officials along with the rest of the world stay silent.</seg>
