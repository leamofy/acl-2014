851,A BBC forums said there will never be suicide attacks in India and also never terrorism in front of a particular faith in the target.,In the extremism word Anti-Islam remarks of his life.,The extremists who is the comments of the above you are not terrorism to send to the particular target,When would our Muslims learn that demon could not be fought with sword.,After seeing the bombardment of Israel in which innocent people unarmed heart cries tears of blood what to do?,But the root cause is this that in the name of killing people which gives a bad impression on Islam,When Palestinian heads had accepted Israels existence then what is the necessary for himas to attack Israel with rockets or committing suicide attacks.,This type of behavior is against humanity.,Then we have a view of America and other countries supporting Israel.,God bless all Muslims to be one&#44; &#39;Ameen&#39;
861,And main terrorist should be prosecuted for their painful activities because the main work is done by him.,Or else will terrorist be able to do on such a great level of terrorism and who is behind this everyone knows.,In this situation in easy language it could be denoted as mafiasm,Hitting people hard and leave them to cry.,Although medicines for the wounded&#44; shrouds and compensation money for the dead are being provided by the Arab Rulers but it is being asked.,What should be done about Israeli attacks?,The problem is that the heads of state of all the muslim countries including Saudi Arabia are in a deep slumber. Neither do they have an army nor any defensive strategy. All they think of is that by giving aid&#44; they have fulfilled their obligation.,They should immediately take practical steps against Israeli aggression.,Like placing an embargo on the oil to European countries and America but alas they ......,Greetings to all brothers and sisters!
871,In my opinion&#44; telling Hamas to quit in the name of peace now&#44; would be an injustice to thousands of widows and orphans.,If the Israelites and their supporters are at a rise&#44; then soon Moses shall be born&#44; as this is the law of nature. America and Israel work as gunpowder amongst suicide bombers in Muslims.,The power drunk elephants do not understand this.,Abu Abdulla: Pakistan.,Hamas and Israel should reconcile so that this bloodshed comes to an end.,Muhammad Sarfraz&#44; Paris&#44; France,Absolutely true.,Let’s suppose that Hamas is really the righteous one and they have waged Jihad against the tyranny to become successful in the divine court&#44; even then they should at least realize that if good brings harm to the people then it is of no use,Those who claim to love God&#44; his Messenger&#44; and their religion; it becomes an integral part of their faith to love humanity.,After the Muslims around the world camps are totally wiped out to marry&quot;&quot;&#44;the order of God.

891,Pakistan ،Feroz magsi، Jhang،,And better than this would be that israel should be investigated and teach them good and let the world in peace.,Muslims have plenty of land and resources.,There is need to be used properly.,One of the shameful situation is this that there wound be no compromise between Himas and Alfath.,famous personalities like Yasser Arafat and Sheik Yasein were been assassinated very diplomatically for Mosque Aksa fighting for &#39;Jihad(holy war)&#39; could be weakened this could have been done only by assassinating Yaseer and Arafat.,The world is watching how after these two leaders Palestinians second by second scattering,and how Jews second by second strengthening their positions,In 1974 a Pakistani Prime Minister was of such an International trust that first time in history he united all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance.,Today on his 81st birthday is it hard enough for the nation to promise for unity with each other
901,but by eliminating the differences between other Muslims will accomplish its (establishment of Islamic Common Wealth) incomplete mission.,This is the Jin which has grabbed the Palestine by half a century.,This Jin has many mouths.,Many times this Jin converts the attention and pressure of the World by calling bad names to himeself from his own or from any other mouth.,And other mouth of this Jin is eating humen beings in Iraq&#44;Afghanistan&#44;Iran and in Pakistan.,And this Jin is the most anoid with Islam than any other&#44;because it knows that whenever it had turned out&#44;it would have been only and only by Islam&#44; Muslims&#44; and complete faith of Muslims and by practical Islam.The history tells that Islam has taken many people like Abu- Jehal on the right path.,Israel With air attack bombarded on Gaza and also attacked missiles since 27th December,Due to these attacks more than 300 Palestinian civilians are dead,After air attacks now Israeli tanks and with other military vehicles of land inspection have reached the border of Gaza,UNO Security Council in Emergengency meetings have declared it as not good and guided Israeli and paestinians to stop the inspections
911,Hence Israeli officials have said that they would continue this inspection until they are confident about Israel not targeted by rocket attacks,In your opinion is this right for Israel to say about this inspection is to protect Israel?,In this situation is the world organization playing its role?,Is this situations due to uprising situations in Israel?,Is America after having the new President Bari Obama will there be any good in conditions in west?,(Respective please note that the words typed in Urdu will be reviewed,for this in onscreen board press alt+shft and select Urdu?,Palestine is a holy place for us and its defence is our duty,And we should also remain that Palestine is our first place of worship,And israel and america has to be destroyed one day.Cause they were made to be finished and God is surely going to get them into disaster.

921,The dark and tough night is very hard suffer,Problem can not be solved just by prayers,Such reviews are anxiously telecasted by BBC.,After all the image and prestige of neutralism has to be kept.,Though BBC news are often true but the real thing is the delivery.,What to highlight and which news is given less importance.,etc. etc.,Zaheer Chughtai,Now In this regard our Pakistani print and electronic media&#44; specially few Urdu newspapers and columnists etc. are not behind in the trade who in the coverage or writing of increasing terrorism exaggerate to hell.,The United Nations said that apparently the Human Rights and Peace tells Muslims&#44; but it is working on the oppression and coercion and extremists. The mouth of the words that are listening to see the Hamas attack when closed. This into the contested fraud.
931,The Muslim is huddled cruelty so that if people like امريکہ Supported the Jews&#44; to clean of God&#44; said that This nation of ذليل of the nation and his life will be the nation perfectly normal If you can not plaintiff life if courage to امريکہ is behind the و backing and ديکھنا then that took place&#44; and the زندگى-,All these world renowned leaders and people who murder innocents in the name of peace should realize that peace in the world can only be achieved by justice&#44; and not through injustice or wiping entire races.,If killing a particular race off completely is the answer&#44; then Hitler&#39;s plan would not have seen any jews survive&#44; and definitely not seen their rise.,Says a poet,Injustice is injustice. If it breeds&#44; it dies.,Blood is blood. If it bleeds&#44; it dries.,How can anyone define terrorism?,Isn&#39;t all this terrorism too? Why does only ones pain seem painful?,Aren&#39;t other people human too? So why is only Muslim blood so important?

941,I watched the Mumbai attacks investigations like the fire was in my own home. I cannot watch this human suffering. Can&#39;t everyone else see this suffering? I wish Muslims all over could come together and think about this.,Bodies on load without anyone to see wounded and blooded innocent faces how does not get words to describe,it is pity on the position of Muslims at one side if people are killed in India then the whole without evidence tells Pakistan to investigate or else we would do it,And other side Israel wants to end Muslims and world is quiet this is unacceptable,God has light not darkness and when this darkness ends then.,The threat to Israeli sovereignty is a joke as long as it has America&#39;s backing.,As far as elections are concerned&#44; it is not surprising that the people who are in power do such things to win the heart and mind of people especially in a state like Israel. And speaking of Barak Obama&#44; history shows that no American president has wavered from the policy and will not do so in future. A tyrant is a tyrant whether he is white or black.,It appears from the conversation of forum that everyone is grieved over Benazir death but as politician her mistakes are not forgotten.,It is debatable that Benazir died for democracy or for power.,If she sacrificed for democracy then why she left democracy in the dictatorship of Musharraf for 10 years till she got a deal and American clearance?
951,Benazir did not return Pakistan when dictatorship affected people needed her she returned Pakistan when she has the assurances of free from cases and of power.,No one is going to say anything about the way that this historical figure is being falsely accused.,Sana Khan.,Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them.,One more writer.,Sir/Madam&#44; maybe if you read not only the history of Pakistan&#44; but of it&#39;s neighboring four countries&#44; or of seven other countries&#44; then you might understand the meaning of Mr. Psycho.,Tariq Abbas,One whose nature is wrong cannot be taught.,For reflection in water is not always clear.,Britain never let them become one&#44; and invented the hindu-muslim friction which was taken ahead by sir Syed.

981,This is also the history of America.,Though in case of an attack by India&#44; America will achieve her goals and the expenditure will all be that of India.,Pakistan should clearly state that they will not take the initiative but if any aggression is waged&#44; then the talk of peace and ceasefire will only take place either after India’s complete destruction or its capture&#44; even if this happens at the cost of their lives.,This is exactly what Islamic history is.,Before this resolution Pakistani people and army has delivered their message.,Indian struggle for having unusual diplomatic and military benefits in compensation of Mumbai attacks are proving her cunning party then affected. Therefore the world has reduced its pressure on Pakistan contrasting to its initial hard reaction.,UN has expressed faith on Pakistani efforts ignoring the unnecessary lamentation of India and Interpol&#39;s appreciation of Pakistani efforts is the &#39;side effect&#39; of unwanted Indian diplomacy.,Translation of the first sentence goes here.,Translation of the second sentence goes here.,NO TRANSLATION FOUND ON 990

1211,One solution of the problem is that the Urdu speaking people learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu or if everyone learns English&#44; the better.,You will certainly think of the suggestion as absurd&#44; but don’t you think the cause of the conflict is bizarre?,That the cause of clash is language?,Zaheer Chughtai,Sir&#44; during my childhood&#44; I really gave this suggestion on numerous occasions to my friends of all ethnic and religious groups; every time people laughed at it.,At that time&#44; these ethnic and religious sentiments of hatred were not so strong&#44; they were merely boiling inside.,Can&#39;t understand what and why it is happening?,Are these the indicators of Dooms day.,By what reason innocents are dieing?,Every one knows the causes those who want to destroy Pakistan are involved and those who commit all this have no religion or country.
1221,Either Karachi or Mumbai it is an inside job.,Every upcoming government gets herself involved in changing the names of places&#44; like now a days airport&#44; roads&#44; buildings all Benazir.,Is this the meaning of Benazir which is happening in Karachi and to the peoples of Pakistan?,In accordance with the Mumbai attack it is said that the the task in Karachi have been failed to perform. And now that these job elements should resign.,The Indians in the Karachi should wake up as the laborers are speaking improperley.,The National parties&#44; political parties&#44; religious parties &#44; linguistic and national parties react in a diplomatic manner for India against the bomb attack,MQM and ANP are responsible for the worse situation in Karachi and administration is not neutral.,Administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately,&#44; police and rangers don&#39;t take action because of political parties pressure.,To unite is only expressed in speeches&#44; political parties should have to quit their interests and work for common people.
1231,Till the end administration is under political pressure such incidents will increase&#44; Allah bless Pakistan.,In my openion&#44;these are the biggest terrorrists.,And there must be some foreign hands behind it but do&#39;nt know which?,But if these circumstances occured in any city of N.W.F.P&#44;then govt. had to do anything against it using all of it&#39;s resources but the govt. seems to be helpless when this is not in N.W.F.P.,Govt. should take an army action here saving a big and important city of the country from terrorism.,Otherwise Pakistan will have to face an enormous financial crisis.,BBC Urdu is also under fear. whereas the tax situations in Pakistan is very bad.,BBC Urdu has all the truth.,one of the problem is this Urdu speakers learn pastu or pastu speakers learn Urdu or its better if all learns English.,obviously you would imagine this would be tough but due to due would tough become any simpler?
1241,is language is a problem for communication?,At last another merciless incident in Karachi that was terrifiying every citizen for long.,The media reports are only 50 percent of last four incidents occured there.One did&#39;t left any space according to his chances.,Last three nights were sleepless and are still afraid.,To kill the cobblers and dry fruit sellers who tried to emptify the hotels.,They who cut the ears of innocent people and rob at the super highway&#44;are all ignorent of Allah&#39;s approach&#44;to whom they will be a victim of one day.,In your perspective what is the reason for bad peace?,(BBC),Keeping in front of painful mumbai attack of India searching reason for bad peace in Karachi is not necessary but it is straight this only happened because the shed of &#39;blood&#39;,Its an open secret that if anyone fights with &#39;father&#39; then &#39;son&#39; getting out of control is not amazing thing.
1251,Liaqat Ali Khan and many devotees also belonged to there&#44;for correcting the misunderstanding of Mr. Psycho I am quoting a verse,We also will follow our ancestors,sacrificed for her existence and will sacrifice to save her.,Faizan Taufiq Siddiqui,It is very sad&#44; the whole country is at stake while we are fighting with each other.,Mr. Siddiqui for your kind information if Wikipedia.,org is searched for Liaqat Ali Khan&#44; you will know that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family of an area of Punjab Karnal.,Due to his services for Muhajirs&#44; they consider him their leader.,Every action has got a reaction.,Till our own is bearable but.
1261,Ijaz Awan,Before that you gather a crowd of people giving suggestions over the night&#44;I have to tell you that we can find true evidences of real missbehaving in the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalkings and posters.,We have been bearing both kinds of misbehaviour.,By the way&#44;vegabonds even did not tolerated newly existed Pakistan and its founder.But they have never faced any reaction.,In return&#44;creating problems for the same country&#44;Pakistan,Only Muslim League (N) was left&#44; she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to Peoples Party.,Before this MQM and Muslim League (Q) has already submitted the draft of 18th amendment in assembly and senate.,Till now it appears that 18th amendment was a political move and none of the party is sincere in its approval.,This is why nobody has raised voice in the favor of this amendment in senate or assembly and neither forced the House to approve the amendment.,It seems that by submitted the draft of 18th amendment these parties has beaten around the bushes means they can claim that we had submitted the amendment but the ruling party&#39;s speaker did not proceed.
1271,MQM an ally of government&#44; Muslim League (N) secret friend and Muslim League (Q) has approved the 17th amendment&#44; then how is it possible that they are sincere in removing 17th amendment.,It is like painting red to be counted amongst martyred.,Peoples Party is not what so ever in a hurry to remove 17th amendment.,Nobody can think of cutting his own hands.,As long Zardari is President 17th amendment will be there.,It was majority&#39;s opinion in our one survey and a fact too.,If 17th amendment ought to be removed then Zardari wont become president.,Now he is more powerful then President Pervez as along with the President he is the Chairman of Peoples Party.,Till he is president 17th amendment is there.,For removing 17th amendment political parties has to depart President Zardari from President house first.
1281,Neither MQM wants it nor the other parties.,Most elders of our family belonged to labor class.,And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.,To seek refuge from it we wrote a letter to the editor of daily Amroz and asked “what should we do after matriculation exams that we don’t have to go through strenuous physical labor.,Editor in his reply wrote that we should become a doctor or an engineer and should opt for such and such subjects to study.,From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.,But at the time of admission in FSC elder brother insisted on doing FSC in Pre Medical and become a doctor.,We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.,It means that the fear of strenuous physical jobs made us to become engineers and now we are well placed among many the youth of our family and for this we are thankful to God,This we remembered when we were trying to lift carpet from our old house with our two young sons.
1291,It was not even 30 minutes for us working that our younger son said “Dad it feels like I am not born for this job.,We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.,Son started saying that I am studying and will complete my studies but I can’t do this work .,Three of us somehow managed to finish the job and got back home.,What it means is that when a man decides the destination no matter what were the motives behind this no one can stop him from getting it.,But if you don’t even know what you have to do then God be with you.,It is said that don&#39;t accuse the dead&#44; but can&#39;t help it as we see only evils in her on the first anniversary of Benazir.,On one side Benazir crushed independence movement of Sikhs by handing over the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India for her own sake and on the other hand provided India an opportunity to fully concentrate in Kashmir after crushing the movement in Punjab.,The greed of Benazir and Nawaz Sharif for government is a part of history which pushed the country back for many years.,During her exile Benazir continued to give negative statements on Kashmir and Atomic Program.
1301,Benazir made a deal with Pervez Musharraf while betraying the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif.,During her reign Benazir provided her husband the opportunity of making money and because of this he popularized as Mr. 10 percent.,Benazir brother was killed during her reign whose assassins are still safe.,Though a woman still Benazir avoided to fight for the rights of women.,Just like Benazir politicized her father&#39;s dead body similarly his widower husband politicizing her dead body.,Benazir reigned twice but not only she failed to punish her father&#39;s political murder but could not file a case against them.,It has been thirty seven years since the separation of East Pakistan and look at the height of insensitivity of our people and rulers that neither did anyone mourn nor grieved over their mistakes on that day.,It should have happened that we should look upon 16th December as a black day and should take appropraite steps so that this type of accident does not happen again.,On that day&#44; we send humanism messages to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to us.,Rulers open the file of Mehmood-ul-Rehman Commission in order to study the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
1311,They are making strategies to bring back the Beharis (ethnic class) stranded in Bangladesh and send them gifts to encourage them.,But we have become so indifferent that when someone dies in our own neighborhood we don&#39;t know about it.,We are not even concerned about our brothers because we have become too self-centered.,Even after big tragedies we return to our routine life the next day.,Perhaps&#44; like East and West Germany were united&#44; in the same way&#44; East and West Pakistan will also be united once more.,We can still be united if we are prepared to make sacrifices for each other and come out of the crust of selfishness.,But this wish does not seem to be fulfilled in the near future,Today when it was told in the news that Governor of American State Illinois has been arrested for charges of corruption,and to remove him from governorship provincial Congress is preparing for his rapid accountability&#44; our American friend who has a keen interest in Pakistani affairs exaggeratedly said to me &#39;see this is democracy&#39;.,No one is beyond the law in America.
1321,and here is your country Pakistan whose president was dropped of the corruption charges before sworn in.,My sense of humor rouse and I said what&#39;s strange if a governor has been arrested in America&#44; in our Pakistan prime minister was arrested overnight and once was hanged and second time was exiled.,Tell me&#44; has it ever happened in America?,In Pakistan the country law breaker has been departed from President House with guard of honor&#44; tell me has it ever happened in America?,In Pakistan Chief Justice has been dismissed as despite of public support he is not reinstated yet&#44; has this ever happened in America?,In Pakistan fake degree holder has become the Health Minister&#44; did this happen in America?,By hearing this American laughed like mads and also accepted his defeat.,In the picture&#44; despite being flanked by Americans from all sides&#44; President Zardari is smiling.,From his joy it looks like,He thinks that the Americans are with his government. What he forgets is that these same people were with Musharraf a year before.
1331,This picture has been taken as it was a family gathering,A photo like this was never published in the papers before; one president with three American officials.,It seems the American involvement in Pakistan has increased and more than one official is needed to do the job; or they are not relying on their new puppet the way they relied on the one before him.,This could also have been arranged keeping in mind the stories of President Zardari’s breach of commitments.,If it had been a sensible ruler&#44; at least he would not have been grinning during the photo session and he would have had a subservient and embarrassing look on his face.,If the principle of democracy is applied on this picture then Present Zardari is in minority.,In democracy&#44; majority rules the country and the picture reveals the actual rulers.,The scenic Swat valley is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.,The government’s policy so far is to engage in talks besides the use of force.,But the use of force is achieving nothing other than strengthening the Taliban and increase in public sympathies for them.
1341,What is needed of the government is to address the root cause of this menace instead of using force.,With the root causes addressed&#44; Fazalullah and Taliban will die out themselves.,The Shariat Bill by the ANP government will help to address the problem to a great extent.,But the government must address the financial problems in addition to the implementation of Shariat.,General Musharraf&#44; the rights that his aches that this nation diagonal scientists have activity will be rid of the power&#44; but those who has the intention of changing the interview with CNN,He also to the amadein,The expected actions and the steps arranged was end,When the rule of Bush was at an end he was scared and he started dealing with theives,General Musharraf&#44; the army had to control&#44; but the present Government not only to what is the.,If it was Bajaur&#44; or Swat the terror was uncontrollable by army.
